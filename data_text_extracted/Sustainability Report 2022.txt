Dear Vestas stakeholder,
The dual threats of catastrophic climate change and energy scarcity 
spurred by Russia’s war of aggression have revived society’s focus 
on energy, especially the urgent need to accelerate the sustainable 
energy transition � 
Vestas technology already plays a major part in the solution to these 
crises� The turbines produced and shipped by Vestas in 2022 alone 
will avoid 408 million tonnes of CO 2e emissions over their operation -
al lifetime � And they will do so while reducing energy bills, driving job 
creation, and building energy independence � Across the world, 
analysts, policy-makers, and NGO’s are betting that renewable 
energy sources, especially wind energy, will become the backbone of 
the green transition � In order to keep global carbon emissions in line 
with the Paris Agreement, wind energy installations will need to 
quadruple by the end of this decade � 
While we are proud of the impact we have enabled so far, we remain 
aware of the challenges ahead � To scale our sustainable energy 
solutions at the pace required to meet global climate goals, we must 
A business 
strategy rooted 
in sustainability
Executive statement
partner strategically with customers, suppliers, and even competi -
tors to mature our supply chain and local manufacturing capabilities � 
A technology and energy transition of this magnitude leaves room 
for many players, and we must work strategically with key partners 
to be successful in our scaling ambitions �
As we collaboratively scale-up for the energy transition, we must 
also ensure we do so sustainably, meeting the present needs of a 
diverse set of stakeholders without compromising the needs of 
future generations � In 2020, we formalised this commitment with 
our first global sustainability strategy entitled “Sustainability in 
everything we do �” This strategy includes the entire value chain, 
unlocking the full decarbonisation potential of wind energy while 
minimising its potential negative impacts on our environment and 
our societies � 
The strategy consists of four key pillars � 
First, we are committed to achieving carbon neutrality across our 
own operations by 2030 – without using carbon offsets, requiring 
that all of our offices, factories, vehicles, vessels, and other operations 
6
Vestas Sustainability Report 2022
In brief General GovernanceEnvironment Sustainability dataSocial Appendix
are fully decarbonised through our own actions � At the same time, 
we are working to decarbonise the entire wind energy supply chain 
by working with strategic suppliers to lower the carbon intensity of 
our turbines by 45 percent by 2030 � We will achieve this through 
changes in turbine design, procurement of materials, and decarbon -
ising the infrastructure to transport and service our wind farms � 
Second, we are committed to creating zero-waste wind turbines by 
2040� Through our industry-leading Circularity Roadmap, we have 
outlined our pathway and interim targets towards this goal, 
including a commitment to create technically and commercially 
recyclable turbine blades, increase our material efficiency by 90 
percent, decrease our supply chain waste by 50 percent, and 
increase our refurbished component utilisation rate to 55 percent, 
all by 2030�
Third, we are focused on a socially responsible energy transition � To 
continue our decades long emphasis on safety, we are working to 
further reduce our injury rate 85 percent by 2030 � To build a more 
inclusive energy sector, we will increase the share of women in 
leadership positions to 30 percent by 2030 � And to support the 
communities that are impacted by our activities, we have committed 
to reach 35,000 community beneficiaries through our corporate 
social responsibility projects by 2025 �
Finally, we aim to lead the transition to a world powered by sustaina -
ble energy by electrifying new sectors, including using Power-to-X 
technologies, and publicly campaigning to drive sustainable change �
Despite the urgent demand for renewable energy and our pioneering 
sustainability strategy, we remain in an extremely challenged 
business environment � This year, all western OEM’s producing wind 
turbines are doing so at a financial loss, a situation that threatens to 
thwart our progress towards bolstering energy security and driving 
decarbonisation � The systemic challenges that currently face the 
energy transition require systemic solutions � To build a world that 
runs on renewable power, energy systems must be redesigned and 
optimised for renewable power generation, permitting must be 
streamlined, and the renewable industry must be able to capture 
enough value to reinvest into building scale �
Through 40 years of technological innovation, pioneering spirit, and 
extraordinary passion, Vestas has become the global leader in sus- 
tainable energy solutions � But as we prepare for the massive scale- 
up required to combat climate change and secure energy independ -
ence, we will now partner with strategic customers, suppliers, and 
business partners who share our vision for a world powered by 
sustainable energy � We are already inspired by the immense 
support, engagement, and collaboration of our strategic partners, 
and aim to prioritise and strengthen these relationships moving 
forward � In doing so, we will collaboratively build a sustainable and 
resilient energy system, and a better future for our living planet �

Executive statement
Our sustainability strategy
Sustainability targets and performance
Our sustainability strategy, "Sustainability in 
everything we do," consists of four key pillars, and 
is based on a materiality assessment of critical 
issues for our stakeholders�
We continue to make incremental improvements for all but one 
strategic target � Our decarbonisation journey for our own operations 
and supply chain continues as planned, and we have continued to 
improve our material efficiency and recycling rates � We are also on 
target for increasing our share of women in leadership positions � 
However, in some cases, we must renew our efforts to ensure steady 
progress towards long-term targets � For example, while we have 
successfully reduced our TRIR by 69 percent over the last 10 years, 
the TRIR over the last three years has plateaued � We must find 
innovative new ways to continue our safety journey if we are to 
remain on target for 2025 goals �

Our sustainability strategy
↑ 
Lisa Ekstrand 
VP, Sustainability
“We aim to transform our impact from shareholder 
to stakeholder value. In doing so, our sustainabili -
ty efforts can ensure that we holistically generate 
value for the climate system, for the biosphere, for 
prosperous and resilient societies, and for our 
customers, shareholders, and employees.”
2022 marks a year of incredible recognition as our sustainability 
ratings and rankings continued to improve � Our Circularity Roadmap 
received the highest prize from our industry association in Denmark � 
We were added to the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index and 
awarded an A score in climate by CDP � In January 2023, we were 
ranked the most sustainable energy company, and the second most 
sustainable company in the world, by Corporate Knights' Global 100 �
But our sustainability journey is far from complete � A wave of 
legislation, tender requirements, and investor enquiries necessitate 
that we continually update our sustainability disclosures in line with 
evolving stakeholder expectations � Some of these shifts are fairly 
technical, such as national recycling targets or individual customer 
specifications, but others are more transformative to our company 
and industry � 
To maintain our position as a leader in sustainability, we must ensure 
our business activities are aligned with science-based physical 
boundaries � Our first experience with this way of thinking was 
accomplished when we received validation by the Science-based 
Targets initiative (SBTi) that our net-zero trajectory was in-line with a 
1�5 degree warming scenario � This year, we have concretely 
segregated and screened all our business activities as aligned with 
the EU taxonomy for sustainable activities (see pages 87-91) �
While we support the wave of increasing regulation regarding sus  - 
tainbility disclosures, we will maintain our primary focus on concretely 
progressing in the areas which are most material for our business 
and stakeholders � This includes an alignment of our impacts with 
science-based boundaries to ensure that when we do have an impact 
on the environment or society, it is neutral or positive in nature � 
As we advance our strategy towards “Neutral or positive impact,” we 
aim to trans  form our impact from shareholder to stakeholder value � 
In doing so, our sustainability efforts will evolve from providing a 
competitive edge as a company to holistically generating value for 
the climate system, for the biosphere, for prosperous and resilient 
societies, and for our customers, shareholders, and employees � This 
is the ultimate ambition of “Sustainability in everything we do,” and 
essential for securing our place as the global leader in sustainable 
energy solutions �

In brief
In collaboration with long-term supplier Windcat 
Workboats, we launched a pilot programme to ex -
plore how the world’s first hydrogen-powered crew 
transfer vessel (CTV) can help reduce carbon emis -
sions from our offshore service operations � 
The CTV is powered by a dual-fuel solution, capa -
ble of being powered by hydrogen in a combination 
with marine gas oil � Hydrogen fuel contains no car -
bon, enabling a significant reduction in carbon 
emissions while maintaining the same power out -
put� The solution will be tested as part of a pilot 
programme at the Norther Wind Farm � Launched 
from July to December 2022, the programme al -
lowed us to explore a scalable approach of incorpo-
rating hydrogen into our operational setup, while col-
lecting insights on the opportunities and limitations 
of hydrogen-powered vessels in daily operations � 
Over the full trial period, the new CTV generated a 
CO2e saving of 9�3 tonnes compared to a traditional 
vessel� The vessel was powered primarily by grey 
hydrogen due to a lack of available green hydrogen 
in the amounts needed � Through the pilot and sub -
sequent scale-up, we aim to mature a pathway for 
green hydrogen in our offshore operations, that can 
be leveraged once green hydrogen has reached the 
required level of maturity� 
“Hard to abate sectors, such as shipping, will be the 
final frontier in our global journey towards decar -
bonisation � Hydrogen is a crucial technology to ad -
vance this journey, which is why we are eager to 
test its potential to reduce emissions from our ser -
vice operations and proud to be driving this pilot,” 
says Christian Venderby, Executive Vice President, 
Service, Vestas � 
“This vessel, developed with our sister company 
CMB�TECH, offers the industry a cost-effective 
solution to significantly reduce carbon emissions 
from service vessels� By using dual fuel combustion

engines, we can make hydrogen technology opera -
tional in the industry and kick-start further devel -
opment of the technology, regulation, and supply 
chain� Collaborations like these are needed in order 
to to scale this technology further� We thank Vestas 
for taking this first step," says Willem van der Wel, 
Managing Director of Windcat Workboats � 
“The operation of a CTV in the North Sea that also 
runs on hydrogen will create the necessary demand 
for investments in hydrogen supply� Norther is hon-
oured that Vestas is bootstrapping this value chain 
and pleased that we are contributing to the reduc -
tion of emissions �” says Christophe De Schryver, 
Executive Manager, Norther Wind Farm �

Decarbonising 
steel production
In focus
 
Through early and robust engage-
ment with our steel suppliers, we 
intend to become a leading user of 
emissions-reduced steel, and part 
of the solution in the decarbonisa-
tion of the steel value chain�
Rasmus Boizas - Senior Purchasing Manager, T ower Materials
Accelerating the decarbonisation  
of the steel industry is our single 
greatest carbon reduction 
challenge� 
Steel and iron make up between 80 and 90 per -
cent of a wind turbine’s material mass, and com -
prise around 50 percent of our Scope 3 emissions � 
While the lifecycle CO 2e emissions of electricity 
from wind generation are extremely small com -
pared to other generating sources, we nonethe -
less seek to reduce our carbon footprint to net-ze -
ro, and this means finding ways to decarbonise the 
emissions produced during the raw material ex -
traction and refinement of steel � 
We occupy a unique position in the transformation 
of the steel sector, since we not only consume the 
material but also provide cost-competitive renew -
able energy solutions � Renewable energy can be 
used to help decarbonise many hard to abate sec -
tors using green hydrogen, including steel produc -
tion� By collaborating with our suppliers and cus -
tomers, we can use emissions-reduced steel to 
achieve our own Scope 3 emissions reduction tar -
get while helping decarbonise the wider steel in -
dustry with our sustainable energy solutions �
Worryingly, despite mounting public pressure and 
the increasing certainty of climate science, the car -
bon intensity of steel production has remained un -
changed over the last two decades � Most projec -
tions indicate that progress is not being made fast 
enough or at the scale necessary to achieve a 
net-zero scenario� 
While we are pushing to accelerate the decarboni -
sation of steel, further collaboration with the steel 
industry and increased incentives for green steel 
production will be critical to achieving our goals � To 
help decarbonise steel production, we: 
• Incentivise the production of CO 2-reduced steel 
in partnership with our suppliers 
• Partner with suppliers in the creation and 
utilisation of green hydrogen and renewable 
electricity to help decarbonise steel production 
• Invest in the development of alternative 
materials, such as wooden towers, to manufac -
ture our turbines
As part of our program to decarbonise steel pro -
duction, we joined the World Economic Forum’s 
First Movers Coalition in May 2022, committing to 
procure at least 10 percent near-zero emissions 
steel by 2030 � Through this commitment, we are 
sending a strong demand signal to our steel suppli -
ers that we are eager for transformative changes in 
the production of steel, and will prioritise working 
with steel companies that invest in emissions-re -
duced products �

A break-through in blade recycling 
Turbine blades have previously been challenging 
to recycle due to the chemical properties of epoxy 
resin, a resilient substance that was believed to be 
impossible to break down into reusable compo -
nents � This has led to many technology leaders 
attempting to replace or modify epoxy resin with 
alternatives that can be more easily treated � 
Along with our partners, we now present a new 
solution that renders epoxy-based turbine blades 
as circular, without the need to change the design 
or composition of blade material � Combining newly 
discovered chemical technology with industrial 
scale, the solution can be applied to blades cur -
rently in operation � This will eliminate the need for 
blade redesign, or landfill disposal of epoxy-based 
blades when they are decommissioned �
The solution is enabled by a novel chemical pro -
cess that can chemically break down epoxy resin 
into virgin-grade materials � The chemical process 
was developed in collaboration with Aarhus 
University, Danish Technological Institute, and 
Olin, who are the partners of the CETEC (Circular 
Economy for Thermosets Epoxy Composites) initi -
ative, which is partly funded by the Innovation 
Fund Denmark �
Scaling up the solution
Through a newly established value chain, supported 
by Nordic recycling leader Stena Recycling and glob-
al epoxy manufacturer Olin, we will now focus on scal-
ing up the novel chemical disassembly process into 
a commercial solution � Once mature, the solution 
will signal the beginning of a circular economy for all 
existing, and future epoxy-based turbine blades �
For several decades, producing wind turbine blades 
manufactured with epoxy-based resin has been 
standard practice in the wind industry � In the most 
mature markets for wind energy, the first turbines 
are reaching the end of their operational life, a num-
ber that will only increase over the coming years � 
WindEurope estimates around 25,000 tonnes of 
blades to reach the end of their operational life annu-
ally by 2025� 
Building a circular 
economy for blades
In focus
Along with Aarhus University, Danish T echnological 
Institute, Olin, and Stena Recycling, we developed  
a new solution that enables materials in epoxy-based 
turbine blades to be recovered and re-used, without 
requiring a change in design�

As the newly discovered process only uses widely 
available chemicals, industrialisation can occur 
quickly and cost-efficiently � Once this new technol -
ogy is implemented at scale, legacy blade material 
currently sitting in landfill, as well as blade material 
in active windfarms, can be disassembled, and 
re-used � 
A pilot project to operationalise the partnership 
and construct new recycling facilities will now com -
mence� Based on the success of this pilot, the part -
ners will begin to scale up the circular blade recy -
cling solutions, signaling the beginning of a circular 
economy for all existing and future epoxy-based 
turbine blades, and a new era for circularity in the 
wind industry �
Once mature, the new solution will provide Vestas 
with the opportunity to produce new turbine 
blades made from re-used blade material � In the 
future, the new solution may also enable all epoxy-
based composite material to become a source of 
raw material in the broader circular economy, poten-
tially encompassing industries beyond wind energy�
This is the ultimate goal of circular economy, the 
first step in which has been unlocked by this break-
through in technology, and proving our philosophy 
that scaling-up sustainably requires innovative col -
laboration with strategic partners � 
 
The newly discovered chemical process 
can turn epoxy-based turbines blades, 
whether in operation or sitting in land-
fill, into a source of raw material�

Issuing the first  
sustainability-linked 
bonds in Denmark
In focus
Sustainability-linked financing is  
a key enabler of our mission to 
integrate sustainability in everything 
we do, and helps ensure that we  
can meet financial and sustainabiltiy 
targets hand-in-hand�
To concretely link progress on our sustainability 
targets with our financial performance, we became 
the first Danish company to issue sustainabili -
ty-linked bonds, joining an exclusive group of com -
panies that have been able to utilise the new fi -
nance instrument so far � Announced in March, the 
two EUR 500 million sustainability-linked bonds 
will enable us to make further investments into an 
industry-leading sustainability performance �
The bonds' fixed rate is directly linked to our sus -
tainability performance � Quantitative peformance 
in three key areas determines whether we are suc -
cessful in achieving the favourable interest rate:
1� Reducing the carbon footprint of  
our own operations (scope 1 and 2)
2� Reducing the carbon intensity of our supply 
chain (scope 3)
3� Increasing the material efficiency of our  
own operations
The full sustainability-linked bond framework 
agreement, including yearly defined targets on 
these KPI’s, is publicly available on our corporate 
website, with progress reports on the bonds is -
sued annually �
External perspective from Lars Eibeholm
"Vestas plays an instrumental role in the global 
green transition to a rapid decarbonisation of the 
global energy supply � In 2022, Vestas established 
the first Danish Sustainability-Linked Bond 
Framework, which provides an opportunity for in -
vestors and shareholders to learn and engage in 
Vestas’ efforts to reduce or eliminate negative en -
vironmental impacts from its operations � Being a 
“green company” does not exclude Vestas for ad -
dressing its environmental challenges �
Sustainability and business strategy integration 
combined with a focused communication ap -
proach is important to show leadership and 
achieve capital markets success � Sustainability-
Linked financing helps accelerate the green transi -
tion and set long-term targets and commitments 
towards key stakeholders including investors, 
banks, customers, employees, business partners 
and society � Further, engaging in sustainable fi -
nance broadens the investor base, reduces the ex -
ecution risk, and allows investors to support and 
follow Vestas on its sustainability journey �
By incorporating sustainability into its financing, 
Vestas has once again showed the way forward for 
its industry and demonstrated their motto of 
'Sustainability in everything we do' �"

Addressing the  
issues that matter
Our approach to sustainability
The concept of sustainability means being able to 
meet the needs of the present generation without 
compromising the ability of future ge-nerations to 
meet theirs (Brundtland Commis-sion 1987)� If a 
practice can continue over time and causes little 
or no harm to people or the planet, it is considered 
socially and environmentally sustainable� 
Sustainability at Vestas means reducing or eliminating negative 
environmental and social impacts � It also means maximising the 
value that our business and products create for our customers, 
employees, shareholders, suppliers, local communities, and the 
planet at large � It involves upholding sustainability in governance 
structures, whereby we hold ourselves accountable to international -
ly recognised principles and standards, act with integrity and 
responsibility, and safeguard responsible processes and remunera -
tions� We believe these efforts not only enhance our own perfor -
mance but help elevate the standards of our industry as a whole �
At Vestas, sustainability is grounded  
in our four corporate values:
 
Simplicity
We eliminate the use of unnecessary resources 
and optimise our energy solutions for displacing 
carbon emissions �
 
Collaboration
We seek a partnership approach to creating 
sustainable solutions, as we acknowledge that 
great achievements are only realised through  
joint action � 
Accountability
We commit to behaving responsibly and  inclusively 
within and across our business, to always act with 
integrity, and to deliver on our targets �
Passion
We are proud of our shared purpose to make 
the planet a better place – our products are a 
testament to our passion for sustainability �

 Internal assessment (impact on business)
External assessment (impact on stakeholders)
To identify the elements of sustainability that are most relevant to 
our business and stakeholders, in 2020 we conducted a materiality 
assessment � This assessment mapped our major economic, 
environmental and social impacts against our stakeholders’ 
interests � As a result of this process, we can now better prioritise 
between a growing number of sustainability issues, and allocate 
resources where they are needed most � 
We commissioned external auditors to conduct our materiality 
assessment, which included four key phases � First, a gap assess -
ment was carried out to evaluate our sustainability strategy against 
emerging mega-trends, both in the wind energy industry and 
globally� Second, selected groups of internal and external stakehold -
ers were prioritised according to their interest in, and influence over, 
our sustainability performance � Third, during the stakeholder 
engagement phase, some of our most important stakeholders were 
asked to evaluate the issues identified in phase one � Finally, these 
issues were then ranked in the materiality matrix on the right � The 
matrix confirms that crucial topics are embedded in our sustaianbili -
ty strategy and helps guide our future sustainability endeavours �
In 2023, we plan to refresh our materiality assessment to incorpo -
rate emerging scientific understanding, reflect the changing needs 
of our stakeholders, and better account for the “double materiality” 
of ESG topics �

Governing  
sustainability
Sustainability governance
Solid governance structures are the backbone to 
our work on sustainability� This section summarises 
how sustainability is managed and governed at 
Vestas and outlines central activities in 2022� 
Group Sustainability
Group Sustainability, led by the Vice President and Head of 
Sustainability, is responsible for developing and coordinating our 
sustainability strategy � In close collaboration with the functional 
areas, the department also drives and practically supports the 
execution of the strategy � Group Sustainability reports to the CEO 
monthly, the Sustainability Committee and full Executive 
Management team multiple times a year, and the full Board of 
Directors at least once per year, with more regular reporting to the 
Audit Committee and the Technology & Manufacturing Committee �
Must Win Battle Sustainability: Matrix organisation
The environmental scope of sustainability is one of our so-called 
Must Win Battles (MWB) � As a result, we take a unique matrix-based 
governance to accomplish the environmental goals � We have 
identified a set of priority projects to decarbonise our own opera -
tions and supply chain, and improve circular economy, which have 
been approved by the Board � Through MWB governance, employees 
in virtually every part of the organisation, from service to procure -
ment to R&D are assigned ownership of specific priority projects � 
The CEO is the owner of the MWB Sustainability, and the VP 
Sustainability is the lead �
Sustainability Leads
Sustainability Leads for each area of the business have been 
appointed � In close collaboration with Group Sustainability, these 
individuals define action plans and resource allocation to support 
the achievement of our sustainability goals and targets within their 
business area � Individual departments are responsible for specific 
global policies, procedures and overall guidance on sustainability: 
Health, safety and environment are managed by the Quality, Health, 
Safety & Environment (QHSE) department; Corporate Social 
Responsibility and Business Ethics are managed by the Legal, Risk & 
Compliance department � We have also appointed design Module 
Sustainability Leads (e �g� for nacelles, blades, towers, etc �)� These 
Module Leads work to achieve reductions in carbon emissions and 
waste through the design of their specific part of the turbine � 
Sustainability Committee
The Vestas Sustainability Committee prioritises, oversees, and 
coordinates cross-functional sustainability initiatives � The 
Committee also ensures our company conforms with and lives up to 
its responsibilities as a signatory to the United Nations Global 
Compact (UNGC) � It is essential that the Committee represents 
Vestas in its entirety, so each member speaks for their respective 
function or department and the Committee reports to Vestas’ 
Executive Management team � The following functions are repre -
sented in the Committee: Investor Relations, Compliance & CSR 
(Corporate Social Responsibility), Sustainability, People & Culture, 
Service, Sales, Procurement, Quality, Safety & Environment, Global 
Supply Chain & Transport, and Power Solutions � 
In 2022, the Sustainability Committee met on a quarterly basis � Key 
priorities included the discussion and approval of initiatives to 
deliver on the sustainability strategy, including emissions-reduced 
steel offerings, emissions targets in modules, safety strategy and 
performance, and incorporating biodiversity in product design � In 
2023, the Committee, in close dialogue with Group Sustainability, 
will continue to oversee the execution of our sustainability strategy �

Product design governance  
and assessment
Vestas Way to Market 
We consider sustainability throughout design and development, a 
process which we call the Vestas Way to Market � We use this 
framework to plan, manage, and execute technology and product 
development across the value chain, while maintaining a firm focus 
on customer requirements � By involving relevant stakeholders in the 
development process, we can build requirements into the product 
design at an early stage � 
Vestas Way to Market is a stage-gate process, with a group of 
gatekeepers positioned at each milestone � This approach helps us to 
decide whether to progress a project to the next stage and ensures 
that specification requirements are met � The specifications are 
based on internal commitments (such as the Prohibited and 
Restricted Substances document), international legislation (such as 
European directives), internationally recognised codes and 
standards set by organisations such as the American Society of 
Mechanical Engineers (ASME), the International Organization for 
Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical 
Commission (IEC), and commitments in our sustainability strategy � 
For example, in 2022 we integrated targets to reduce CO 2e and 
waste generated within the product design of future turbines �
Life cycle assessment (LCA)
Since 1999, we have developed LCAs to provide a ‘cradle-to-grave’ 
evaluation of the environmental impacts made by our products and 
activities � In these LCAs we focus on two key actions: 
• Documenting the environmental performance of Vestas  
wind turbines 
• Analysing results to improve or develop wind turbines with  
less environmental impact 
The studies assess each wind turbine’s entire bill-of-material, 
accounting for the approximately 25,000 parts that make up a 
single turbine � In our LCAs, we conduct a complete assessment of a 
wind power plant, up to the point of connection with the electricity 
grid� This includes the wind turbine itself, its foundation, site cabling, 
and transformer station � 
In 2022, we engaged with a taskforce within WindEurope to help 
standardise LCA approaches among major western turbine 
manufacturers � In time, we expect this collaboration to improve the 
comparability of LCA results in the wind industry � All published LCAs 
are accessible on our corporate website � 
Vestas SiteLCA™ 
We offer our customers the opportunity to receive a customised Life 
Cycle Assessment of their own wind power plants � We call this 
service a Vestas SiteLCA™ � Each assessment determines key 
indicators of environmental performance and takes the wind turbine 
type, site-specific conditions, and production supply chain into 
consideration � 
The environmental performance of wind power plants varies across 
the globe � For this reason, SiteLCA™ provides our customers with 
focused and transparent environmental facts, such as a specific 
wind plant’s carbon footprint, return on-energy, or water-use � These 
fact-based indicators increase business case certainty by support -
ing a customer’s energy strategy � They also support project planning 
and permitting processes, for example regarding decommissioning, 
and public consultation and response �
For more information, please see the Vestas SiteLCA™ brochure on 
our corporate website � 
Management systems
The Vestas Management System enables us to put all external and 
internal sustainability requirements into practice systematically, 
efficiently, and effectively � It is a key to our intent to make sustaina -
bility an integral component of all business processes � In order to 
further demonstrate a commitment to meeting the highest 
standards of health, safety, and the environment, our operations are 
built on global certificates for ISO 9001 for Quality, ISO 14001 for 
Environment, and ISO 45001 for Health and Safety �

Stakeholder engagement 
While the materiality assessment reflects a focused approach to 
align our sustainability strategy with our most important stakehold -
ers, as a global company we interact with a large array of different 
stakeholder groups � These include customers, shareholders and 
investors, employees, policy makers, suppliers, non-governmental 
organisations, local communities, and the media � Our sustainability 
performance is an important part of our relationship with these 
groups� By proactively engaging with stakeholders to understand 
their needs and concerns, we can feed this information back into our 
decision-making process �
We have both categorised and prioritised stakeholders to rationalise 
and focus our engagement efforts � This exercise is based on the 
degree to which they influence Vestas’ performance and are 
affected by it, as well as their interest in Vestas � Engagement ranges 
from forming active partnerships to address common sustainability 
issues, to more passive engagement through, for example, the 
publication of the Vestas Annual Sustainability Report � We use the 
priority given to each stakeholder to determine the most appropri -
ate approach to engagement � 
Transparency is fundamental to our engagement strategy and 
underpins our many engagement efforts � We publicly disclose key 
sustainability information in our Sustainability Report � Additionally, 
we regularly lead more detailed dialogues with key stakeholders, as 
well as keeping day-to-day contact with customers and holding 
annual events such as our Supplier Forum � 
Supplier engagement
Every year we host the Supplier Forum where we engage with our 
most critical suppliers and share expectations for the future 
development of the renewable energy industry � The Supplier Forum 
creates a platform to share business perspectives and expectations 
with our suppliers who represent a large pool of resources and 
networks � We want to connect those resources into partnerships 
through an integrated ecosystem that makes our business and 
industry stronger � 
Developing a sustainable supply base is essential to make long-term 
progress on our sustainability commitments � To enable these 
partnerships and build the foundation for the ecosystem, we must 
mature collaboration with our key partners and facilitate connec -
tions among our partners � 
The theme of this year’s Supplier Forum was “competitiveness”, 
including staying competitive while meeting sustainability require -
ments� A key message was “Sustainability is the new digital arena �” 
Transparent and quality ESG data is a prerequisite to a successful 
partnership with Vestas �
During the event, awards were presented to suppliers that excelled 
in critical areas, including sustainability � This year our supplier 
Schaeffler was presented with the sustainability award � They won 
based on four criteria:
• Ambitious sustainability strategy including 100% renewable 
electricity consumption by 2024, and clear carbon neutrality 
targets
• Green steel partnership engagement with potential for significant 
CO2e reductions 
• Pioneering initiatives to reduce carbon-based fuels in production
• Demonstration of organisational sustainability embedded 
through initiatives such as ‘climate action day’

How we utilise data to accelerate sustainability
Following the Supplier Forum, we conducted three sustainability 
webinar sessions, with the purpose of building capacity and working 
with our critical suppliers towards a sustainable supply base � The 
sessions aimed to convey our sustainability strategy and activities 
to mitigate the environmental and social impacts of our supply  
chain operations � 
ESG data digitalisation
To enable the achievement of our ambitious sustainability goals,  
we invested in a sustainability data platform that uses digital twin 
technology to calculate real-time climate footprints and run 
scenarios that support in monitoring, forecasting, optimisation, and 
target achievement � Our supply chain emissions (scope 3) account 
for approximately 98 percent of our total emissions � Therefore, 
leveraging emissions and waste data from our value chain is crucial 
for our decarbonisation journey � 
After going live in 2022, the sustainability data platform allows our 
suppliers to report their emissions and enables us to calculate the 
real-time environmental footprint and scenarios � This provides 
readily available data for monitoring, forecasting, and optimizing 
sustainability performance for Vestas � We believe having the right 
information is key to efficient decision-making � Using supplier-spe -
cific data rather than industry averages equips us to fully under -
stand the climate-related impact of our supply chain with greater 
accuracy, consistency, and transparency � The platform enables us to 
map impacts throughout the value chain and to prioritise collabora -
tion with suppliers who are working to reduce the emissions 
intensity of their products and materials �
Twenty-one of our strategic suppliers were onboarded and deliv- 
ered emissions data through the software by the end of 2022 �  
Our suppliers benefit by being able to track their year-on year 
emission reduction progress and, in dialogue with us, explore 
reduction opportunities � 
The platform will undergo continuous improvement and deve- 
lopment in the coming years as we continue to onboard additio- 
nal suppliers �

Decarbonising 
energy demand
Our approach
Our impact
We aim to meet or exceed environmental standards and ensure 
environmental protection as a pre-requisite of doing business � 
Although our technology majorly contributes to the green energy
transition, we recognize that our products can have negative
environmental impacts � Our QHSE policy outlines our commitment 
to mitigating these impacts, and we work closely with our
suppliers and customers to enhance the environmental perfor -
mance of our solutions across a broad range of issues � 
Our plans to ensure that our business model and strategy is 
compatible with the highest environmental standards and a 
transition to a climate-neutral economy requires engagement 
from many stakeholders in our value chain � This includes our 
targets and action plans to address material climate related 
impacts, risks, and opportunities � 
Our technology is a key enabler of the green energy transition
Mitigating global climate change by accelerating the green energy 
transition is our greatest positive sustainability impact and core to 
our purpose as a business � Our fleet of turbines already avoids a 
massive sum of carbon emissions (see page 30) � In addition, we are 
committed to decarbonising our own operations and supply chain 
in line with science-based targets (see pages 28-32) �
For example, emissions related to time-bound leases and charter 
contracts for vehicles and vessels used to construct and service 
our wind farms are being phased out in the ongoing transition of our 
operations to carbon neutrality by 2030 (see page 29) �
As a pure-player in wind energy, the vast majority of our revenue, 
operating expenditures, and capital expenditures are eligible and 
aligned with the EU taxonomy on sustainable activities, as they 
significantly contribute to mitigating global climate change (see 
page 87-91)�
The carbon footprint of electricity 
from our turbines is significantly 
reduced compared to other 
electricity-generating sources�
Vestas turbines range from 4-9 kilograms per MWh, and are based on Lifecycle Assessments published on vestas.com.

Carbon neutrality by 2030 - without using carbon offsets Reduce CO2e emissions in the supply chain by 45 percent 
per MWh generated.
We are committed to reducing emissions from 
our own operations by 55 percent by 2025 and 
100 percent by 2030 (from a 2019 baseline) � 
We will achieve this through our own actions, 
rather than utilising carbon offsets � 
In August 2020, the carbon neutrality target for 
our own operations was validated by the Science 
Based Target initiative (SBTi), a programme led 
by the Carbon Project, the UN Global Compact, 
the World Resources Institute, and the WWF � The 
SBTi confirmed that our carbon neutrality target 
is in line with the efforts required to keep global 
warming to 1� 5°C above pre-industrial tempera -
ture levels � This earned us the most ambitious 
designation available through the SBTi valida -
tion process � 
T argets for  
Scope 1 and 2 emissions
By 2030, we are committed to reduce carbon 
emissions from our supply chain by 45 percent 
per MWh produced and shipped � We will deliver on 
these reductions by:
• Supporting our strategic suppliers in  
developing strategies to measure and reduce 
their emissions 
• Redesigning turbines with less carbon- 
intensive materials 
We have chosen an intensity-based target because 
it incentivises sustainability partnerships with 
suppliers who reduce carbon emissions � It also 
allows for the continued growth of the renewable 
energy sector, which is critical to achieving global 
decarbonisation targets �

Action plan for  
Scope 1 and 2 emissions
Since 2013, we have taken a large share of our electricity from 
renewable sources and compensated for non-renewable electricity 
use� Since 2020, we have sourced 100 percent renewable electricity 
across our operations globally � 
By 2025, we will phase out benefit cars powered by fossil fuels �  
In 2022, 872 of our benefit cars, either in-use or ordered from the 
supplier, were electric or hybrid vehicles � To support the scale-up  
of (PH)EVs, we have signed a partnership with Enel X in 2021, which 
has accelerated the electrification of our company fleet � Through  
the agreement, Enel X will provide us with the charging infrastruc -
ture we need to electrify our corporate vehicles across our most 
prominent markets �
In terms of our service fleet, we introduced 76 sustainably fuelled 
vehicles during 2022, including EVs and biofuel vehicles that meet 
strict sustainability criteria, for a total of approximately 300 � This is 
a continuation of a transition to a fully sustainable service fleet, and 
we aim to make all new service vehicles zero-emission from 2025 � 
To decarbonise our offshore service vessels and/ or transition to 
sustainable biofuels, we pioneered the first hydrogen-powered 
vessel in the wind industry in July 2022 (read the story of this ves-  
sel on page 13)� In December 2022, we also signed contracts to 
launch the first offshore CTV vessel powered by methanol, which  
will enter operation in 2023 � These pilot projects are intended as 
learning opportunities to enable a complete green transition of  
the fleet by 2030�
We are transitioning to renewable energy for heating in our fac -  
tories, while improving our energy efficiency across all sites globally � 
In 2022, we matured our mapping of energy consumption and 
initiated a number of projects in this area � For example, we transi -
tioned two natural gas boilers to biomass energy sources and 
replaced an oil boiler with an electric heat pump � For more informa -
tion on our progress related to renewable energy sources, please  
see pages 76- 77� 
In 2022, scope 1 emissions from our own operations amounted to 
98,000 tonnes of CO 2e� Scope 2 emissions amounted to 2,000 
tonnes calculated on a market basis, and 59,000 tonnes on a 
location basis � This represents a reduction in Scope 1 and 2 GHG 
emissions of 12 percent from a 2019 baseline � For our energy 
consumption mix, see page 77 �
Action plan for  
Scope 3 emissions
More than 98 percent of our total carbon footprint stems from our 
suppliers’ operations, so we are determined to work collaboratively 
towards greening our supply chain � At the end of 2022, 46 out of 50 
strategic suppliers committed to working to achieve decarbonisa -
tion of the supply chain � Of these, 96 percent of strategic suppliers 
in sustainability hotspot areas (towers & steel, transport, and blades, 
which cumulatively account for approximately 60 percent of our 
scope 3 emissions) committed to reduce their emissions in line with 
our targets � We continue to work with non-signatories to gain their 
support in our CO 2 reduction commitment �
In 2022, our supply chain CO 2e emissions amounted to 8 �18 million 
tonnes� See table below for a breakdown of Scope 3 emissions � The 
supply chain CO 2e emission intensity decreased 5 percent from the 
2019 baseline and 3 percent from 2021 to a rate of 6 �46 kg/MWh �
-12 %
We have reduced emissions 
from our own operations  
by 12 percent since 2019�

Partnerships for Low-Emission Steel
Decarbonising steel is key to reaching our scope 3 emission 
reduction target � Steel and iron manufacturing account for 80  
to 90 percent of the material mass of a wind turbine, making up 
approximately 50 percent of our scope 3 emissions � In 2022, we 
began partnering with steel suppliers to share our need and secure 
an aligned strategy to accelerate the availability of emissions- 
reduced steel � 
In 2022, we formalised our intent to utilise near zero emissions steel 
by joining the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) First Movers Coalition, 
making a firm commitment to purchase at least 10 percent of our 
steel from near-zero emissions breakthrough technologies by 2030 � 
Exploring alternatives to steel
Through our Vestas Ventures programme, we are an active investor 
in Modvion™, a bio-composite company specialising in modular, 
sustainable wind turbine towers � Modvion’s™ towers are made from 
laminated veneer lumber (LVL), a bio-composite material sourced 
sustainably from a supplier network validated as being in line with 
robust reforestation strategies � When compared directly with the 
value chain of a conventional steel tower, LVL towers are proven to 
reduce carbon emissions by 80 percent � The reduced weight of an 
LVL tower, and the lower CO2 intensity of the materials used, 
contribute to the overall reduction in CO 2 emissions�
We will leverage our position as an investor to support Modvion’s™ 
scale-up strategy � Our goal is to integrate LVL towers into our design 
process and manufacturing operations � Plans to offer a ‘wooden’ 
tower variant are already in development � Through these plans, we 
aim to strengthen our ability to support customers in their sustaina -
bility journey, while continuing to offer cost-competitive solutions 
that address factors such as increased ease of transportation � 
Avoided GHG emissions from products (Scope 4)
As the oldest and largest wind turbine manufacturer and servicer in 
the world, we are a leading contributor to the decarbonisation of 
global energy demand �
Generating wind energy is one of the most carbon-efficient ways of 
producing electricity � A single Vestas wind turbine generates around 
30 to 50 times more energy than it consumes during its lifecycle � 
This offers enormous potential to reduce carbon emissions across 
the global energy system �
To date, our total installed capacity of more than 164 GW globally 
has helped to avoid 1� 9 billion tonnes of carbon emissions, equiva -
lent to the CO2e emissions from 4 �5 billion barrels of oil � And we are 
continuing to scale this potential � In 2022, we increased our total 
aggregate installed capacity by 8 percent compared with 2021� 
We also calculate the amount of expected COe that will be avoided 
over the lifetime of the turbines produced and shipped in the year � In 
2022, the turbines we produced and shipped are expected to avoid 
408 million tonnes of CO 2e over their lifetime � This is calculated by 
first converting the MW of turbines installed into MWh per year, and 
then multiplying by the average capacity factor of Vestas serviced 
wind farms, the expected lifetime of the turbine in years based on 
the design criteria, and the global average emissions intensity of 
electricity from the International Energy Agency �
How we calculate emissions avoided 
Turbines produced and shipped (MWh)  114,808,560

Pollution prevention
Controlling chemicals and hazardous substances used in the 
development, manufacturing, and service of turbines is an impor -
tant part of our management system, and is essential to our 
sustainability performance � We have committed to prevent pollution 
and protect the environment through our QHSE policy � Thus, we 
actively work to find safer and more environmentally friendly 
products to ensure a healthy workplace for our employees and 
minimal impact on the environment �
Our chemical management process follows global procedures for 
the approval of new chemicals � We also provide local instructions for 
handling, transporting and storing chemicals, and a global chemical 
database for sharing knowledge with suppliers �
To adapt to changing chemical legislation globally, such as GHS/CLP 
and REACH, we continuously update a central list of substances � 
This list identifies chemicals that are prohibited around the world 
and restricts certain substances in our product manufacturing and 
service processes �
We require our suppliers to fulfil the requirements set out in our 
prohibited and restricted substances management document for all 
products delivered � We also do not buy products containing 
prohibited substances � If a product contains restricted chemicals, 
the supplier must perform health and safety evaluations to ensure 
correct use of the materials in question �
Furthermore, we expect our suppliers to create action plans for 
phasing out these restricted substances and finding sustainable 
alternatives � In parallel with this process, we assess if a time-bound 
dispensation can be signed off and/or if the product can be 
substituted �
To avoid emission of volatile organic compounds (VOC) from the 
painting of blades we are actively transitioning to low VOC paint � 
Please refer to page 76 for data on our VOC emissions in 2022 �
Water and marine resources 
We measure freshwater withdrawal on a global level � However, as our 
primary use of water is for domestic purposes, the environmental 
impacts resulting from water usage are considered to be minor �
For the service business, freshwater withdrawal increased in line 
with activity levels � In manufacturing, it decreased relatively less 
than production level �
Please refer to page 77 for complete data on our freshwater 
withdrawal and discharge in 2022 �

Fostering local 
biodiversity
Biodiversity preservation
Wind energy can negatively impact local biodiver-
sity� But by decarbonising global energy demand, 
utilising nature-based solutions, and mitigating 
harm through technology, wind farms can have a 
net-positive biodiversity impact�
Biodiversity – the rich diversity of life on Earth – is being lost at an 
alarming rate � The population sizes of mammals, birds, amphibians, 
and reptiles have seen an average drop of nearly 70 percent since 
1970� And more than half of all species face high extinction risk 
under a business-as-usual climate scenario � 
Biodiversity loss endangers human health and food production, and 
erodes the significant value of our natural resources � It is therefore 
clear that protecting biodiversity is a necessary strategic invest -
ment to preserve not only the planet’s species, but our health, 
wealth, and security � 
Renewable energy, principally wind and solar PV, plays an important 
role in mitigating climate change and ultimately in stemming global 
biodiversity loss � But as we accelerate the transition to a world 
powered by renewable energy, we must do so in balance with local 
ecosystems and species � By carefully considering biodiversity in the 
lifecycle of our projects, we can minimise, or even make positive, our 
impact on local fauna and flora � 
Failing to take biodiversity into consideration can lead to costly 
curtailment of our customers’ energy generating capabilities � And in 
the most severe cases, it can threaten to close entire wind farms �
Biodiversity has not been a material focus of our sustainability 
strategy to-date � However, several scientific and framework 
developments such as SBTN (Science Based Targets for Nature)  
and TNFD (Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures)  
will enable us to incorporate biodiversity into our sustainability 
efforts systemically � In 2023, we plan to start this work by conduct -
ing a full biodiversity impact assessment of our operations and 
supply chain and creating a designated biodiversity policy  
and monitoring program �
Siting 
Our greatest opportunity to positively impact biodiversity lies in the 
spatial planning of wind energy development zones � Through wind 
resource and biodiversity impact assessments, we can optimise 
locations within established wind zones � This ensures new wind 
farms do not contribute to habitat loss or endanger threatened 
species� Working with local agencies and regulations, we carry out 
environmental impact assessments when developing new projects � 
We also take appropriate measures to mitigate or compensate for 
any anticipated adverse impacts our projects might have �

Reefs
Offshore wind turbines can 
help protect marine areas and 
the foundations can create 
artificial reefs, helping restore an 
ecosystem heavily damaged by 
overfishing and bottom trawling
Birds and bats
While decarbonisation is essen-
tial to protect global avifauna 
biodiversity, we work to further 
minimise our impact on local bird 
populations with technology�
Siting
By siting new wind farms with 
biodiversity in consideration, 
we can minimise our impact on 
local ecosystems�
Impact assessment 
When establishing a wind plant, the planning process should always 
include a location impact assessment� In many countries, environmen-
tal impact assessments are required by law; they can also be required 
by the financial institutions that support infrastructure projects � In 
most cases, our customers have the primary responsibility for 
undertaking environmental assessments and developing environ -
mental management systems for their wind plants � However, we are 
responsible for these steps in the projects we develop ourselves � In 
either case, we work closely with our customers at every stage � 
Environmental assessments typically take into account direct and 
indirect impacts, including: 
•  Landscape and visual impressions 
•  Flora (e�g� native vegetation) 
•  Fauna (e�g� birds, mammals, fish) 
•  Noise 
•  Shadows
Impact on birds and bats 
Most biodiversity impacts relating to wind development are 
short-term and linked to construction � However, some longer-term 
impacts, such as the direct collision of birds and bats with turbine 
blades, can also occur � Through careful siting outside major 
migration corridors and other sensitive areas, the risk to birds and 
bats can be greatly reduced � 
Remaining impacts to local bird species can be further reduced 
through the operational curtailment of our wind farms � Indeed, our 
turbines can be optimised to curtail operations based on the 
historical peaks of local bird and bat activity, and can incorporate 
radar based systems to track birds and bats even more effectively �
Artificial reefs
Offshore wind farms have the potential to help support marine 
wildlife� Wind turbine foundations and scour protection areas can 
create new habitats for marine species to colonise � In turn, these 
habitats attract additional species in a process known as the 
‘artificial reef effect’, leading to more productive and species-rich 
ecosystems � 
Marine protection 
According to the UN’s Global Framework for Managing Nature 
Through 2030, more than 30 percent of marine areas need to be 
protected by the end of the decade to ensure marine health is 
maintained and restored for the future � By conducting environmen -
tal impact assessments for offshore wind farms, we can contribute 
to the scientific knowledge base that supports marine protection � 
We can also help establish areas with reduced marine traffic, where 
the most environmentally damaging activities, such as bottom 
trawling, are prohibited �

Building a zero- 
waste turbine through 
circular economy
Circular economy
In 2021 we released our Circularity Roadmap, 
becoming the first organisation in the wind 
industry - and one of the first in any sector  
- to translate the theory of circular economy  
into actionable targets and goals� 
Our roadmap, will help us reduce waste across the value chain, with 
the ultimate ambition of producing zero-waste wind turbines by 
2040� The roadmap is based on three key areas: design, operations, 
and material recovery
Design for circularity
Material efficiency
By 2030, we aim to increase our material efficiency by 90 percent � 
Our initial focus is on blade manufacturing, the process which 
creates the most internal waste � To achieve this, we will raise 
awareness within our factories, optimise blade design and produc -
tion methods, source more efficient manufacturing kits, and make 
circularity metrics key performance indicators � 
During 2022, our material efficiency improved 20 percent to 1� 6 
tonnes of non-recycled waste per MW produced and shipped, 
compared to 2 �0 in 2021� To further increase material efficiency,  
we are optimising the use of carbon, glass fabric, and chemicals in 
our blade manufacturing processes � We are also running initiatives 
to map out waste streams in all areas of manufacturing and further 
reduce the use of materials through waste reductions in design  
and packaging � 
Blade and turbine recyclability 
We are significantly accelerating our ambition around blade 
recyclability, pushing the boundaries of circularity by creating a  
truly circular blade � As well as commiting to create a rotor that can  
be 100 percent recycled, we are minimising the down-cycling of 
blade materials � 
While recent innovations have enabled us to recycle blades in some 
regions, the materials recovered from these processes are signifi -
cantly down-cycled � Under our new target, the value of such 
materials will be preserved, enabling recovery and reuse in new 
turbines or similar devices � 
Beyond blades, we are also working to integrate recyclability 
requirements across the full turbine structure � To achieve a ze-
ro-waste wind turbine, we are investigating new recycling pathways 
for difficult-to-recycle materials� Our ambition is to redesign the 
turbine or develop new circularity routes so that every component  
will be recyclable by 2040� 
Our large scale blade recycling project continues in the USA, where 
in 2022 we recycled 475 blades in total (compared with 285 blades 
in 2021), including nacelle and hub covers � Recycling can include 
cement co-processing, gasification, forming new composite 
materials, and reclaiming glass fibre and carbon fibres � We are 
exploring opportunities to offer these services beyond the USA in 
regions where local recycling infrastructure is robust and customer 
demand can be established � 
In 2021, the CETEC (Circular Economy for Thermosets Epoxy 
Composites) initiative, spearheaded by Vestas, has significnatly 
advanced solutions for composite circularity � CETEC technology 
enables circularity for thermoset composites, which constitute the 
majority of turbine blade mass � 
Through the CETEC recycling route, we can disassemble the epoxy 
resin from fibres � Then, we can break down epoxy into its base 
components and reutilise the high-value building blocks in the 
manufacture of new turbine blades � In addition, the CETEC process 
will help to solve circularity challenges in other sectors that use 
composite materials, such as automotive and aviation �

waste intensity by 2030
Started in 2020 and continuing throughout 2022, the DecomBlades 
project has focused on value chains for the recycling of end-of-life 
(EOL) turbine blades� In collaboration with other major manufacturers, 
recycling companies and knowledge partners, DecomBlades aims to 
identify one or more sustainable, globally available and economically 
feasible recycling routes for EOL blades � We are supporting the 
project by developing materials and value streams for three recycling 
routes� The recycling technologies will undergo a complete lifecycle 
analysis and mapping of global warming potential � The project runs 
for three years and is partly funded by Innovation Fund Denmark (IFD)�
Supplier engagement 
In addition to reducing waste in our own operations, we are also 
committing to a 50 percent decrease in the waste intensity of our 
supply chain by 2030 � We are asking our strategic suppliers, 
covering nearly 50 percent of procurement spend, to report on their 
waste generation, and to set waste reduction targets for themselves 
and their own suppliers � Those that do so are granted a Vestas 
Certificate of Circularity Commitment � As we expect our supply 
chain to consolidate in the coming years, suppliers that partner with 
us on our sustainability journey will be highly valued � 
In the first quarter of 2022, we asked 48 of our strategic suppliers 
to report on their waste generation, set waste reduction targets for 
their own operations, and by the end of 2024, set waste reduction 
targets for their suppliers � We expect these initiatives to trigger a 
cascade of waste reductions through our value chain � At the 
year-end, 40 strategic suppliers had officially contributed to our 
circularity commitments and been awarded a Vestas Supplier 
Certificate of Circularity Commitment � We actively continue to 
engage with suppliers on the waste reduction journey through our 
regular supplier meetings with key accounts �

Circular economy
Operational circularity 
Repair and refurbishment 
Across our operations, we are committed to expanding our efforts  
to refurbish and reuse turbine components, while regionalising our
repair and refurbishment infrastructure where possible � Through
refurbishment, we can reuse up to 70 percent of component 
materials, and emit 45 percent less CO 2e than manufacturing a  
new component, even after considering the emisisons involved  
in transportation �
The major components of our turbines are already largely refur -
bished and reutilised � However, our roadmap commits us to achieve
55 percent total refurbished component utilisation by 2030 and 75
percent by 2040, mostly by creating new repair loops for minor
components � This will lead to further waste reduction, lower carbon
emissions, and local job creation �
In 2022, we achieved a total refurbished component utilisation rate
of 17 percent, an improvement of 2 percent year-on-year � The parts 
we currently refurbish are primarily main components, such as 
blades, generators, gearboxes, main shafts, with some minor 
components included as well � We also significantly improved the 
refurbished component utilisation rate on a number of component 
categories � For example, we achieved a refurbished component 
utilisation rate of 71 percent for blades, an improvement of 8 
percent year-on-year � 
Moving forward, we will continue to expand our repair capabilities to 
include additional minor components, and regionalise our refurbish -
ment infrastructure to improve the business case and sustainability 
impact of refurbishment �
Material recovery 
Eliminating landfilling and incineration 
We have committed to reduce the amount of manufacturing waste 
going to landfill to less than 1 percent, waste incinerated to less than 
1 percent, and waste incinerated with energy recovery to less than 5 
percent, all by 2030 � As most of our internal waste is centralised in 
manufacturing facilities, these targets go hand-in-hand with 
improving our material efficiency � However, we are not only focusing 
on our manufacturing waste � 
All of our functional areas - including manufacturing, construction, 
and service - will begin by mapping out their waste streams � As part 
of this process, they will identify priority projects to divert from 
landfill as quickly as possible, with the majority of landfill reductions 
planned to occur before 2025 � As we decrease landfilling and 
incineration, we will increase our recycling rate to more than 94 
percent by 2030� This marks a significant increase from our present 
recycling rate of 55 percent �
In 2022, we landfilled 7 percent of our internal waste, incinerated 38 
percent, and recycled 55 percent � Please refer to Selected environ -
mental data and SASB disclosure for the absolute amounts of waste 
produced by our operations in 2021, along with the breakdown of 
material classes used � 
During the year, waste generation within our service business 
decreased compared to our activity levels � In manufacturing, waste 
generation decreased relatively less than production levels � It should 
be noted that the overall environmental performance of our 
manufacturing facilities varies globally � These fluctuations are 
linked to local infrastructure, turbine variants and the frequency 
with which these variants are introduced � In 2022, we activated our 
governance structure to introduce our new circularity targets, 
covering the entire value chain � For example, we worked with 
sustainability module leads responsible for developing and 
implementing circularity initiatives and targets for each turbine part � 
We also utilised a regionalised HSE structure to introduce year-on-
year recycling targets for each of our factories � 
Circularity implementation and governance 
To support our overall sustainability strategy, we have embedded 
the Vestas Circularity Roadmap throughout our organisation – from 
our engineers designing new turbines, to our factories manufactur -
ing components, to our workers across our global supply chain � 
Nearly every functional area within Vestas has a part to play in 
achieving our circularity ambitions � Internally, the targets outlined 
above have been agreed between Group Sustainability and 
respective functional areas � Interim yearly targets will be estab -
lished and implemented through various internal mechanisms, 
including our Vestas Way to Market stage-gate system (see page 
24) and specific year-on-year recycling targets established for  
each factory �
Externally, governance around circularity is still relatively immature � 
As part of the roadmap, we are planning to engage with external 
partners and the wind industry to create shared circularity govern -
ance� This will enable us to increase transparency and comparability 
of circularity between companies �

Salient human rights  
issues for our three primary  
social stakeholders
Our commitment to become the safest, most 
inclusive, and most socially responsible company 
in the energy industry begins with identifying and 
understanding our potential impacts on people�
We are committed to respecting human rights within our entire value 
chain� Doing so requires us to be aware of our most salient human 
rights issues and how they vary over time � Following our first 
corporate-wide Human Rights Assessment (HRA) by external 
sustainability experts from Business for Social Responsibility (BSR) 
in 2018, our second HRA was conducted in 2022 � While much 
progress has been made since 2018, the latest assessment 
identified some changes in our salient human rights issues as our 
business, and the external environment, evolved � 
The assessments, which analysed different parts of our operations, 
consisted of desktop research, an analysis of internal management 
processes, and interviews � The new assessment evolved to include 
interviews with external stakeholders who represent relevant 
rightsholder groups such as indigenous peoples and workers, in 
addition to our senior management and internal subject matter 
experts � The 2022 assessment also included our new development 
business function, in addition to the manufacturing, construction, 
and service operations units assessed in 2018 �

Salient human rights issues 
Both HRAs identified a number of salient human rights issues across 
our operations and value chain � Every salient human right pertains 
to one or more of our rightsholders groups: our own workforce, 
workers in our value chain, and affected communities � 
Each salient issue was prioritised according to two sets of criteria: 
the salience of risk (scale, scope, remediability, likelihood) and 
relevance for business action (attribution, leverage, risk history, 
current management) � Depending on the salience of risk and the 
relevance for business action, each salient human rights issue was 
assigned a priority level to signal which issues should be prioritised �
Our areas for continuous focus remain the same as in 2018: rights 
related to labour conditions, occupational health and safety, 
community engagement and land rights, especially focused on 
vulnerable groups such as indigenous communities � Some of the 
new focus areas identified for business action by our 2022 
assessment are high-risk and conflict-affected areas, access to 
remedy, and human rights defenders � In the coming years, we will 
prioritise working across the organisation to strengthen our 
processes on these issues � 
Improvements made since 2018 HRA
Since our first HRA in 2018 which concluded that we needed to 
focus on our governance and management of human rights, as well 
as focus on the salient issues highlighted above, we have reached 
the following milestones:
1. Policy improvements:
• Updated Human Rights Policy (see page 41): in 2019, we updated 
our policy to reflect changes to our due diligence processes and 
remedy access � The new policy also acknowledges more right -
sholders, including human rights defenders and indigenous 
peoples, and strengthens our commitment to remedying adverse 
impacts on individuals, workers, and community members � The 
policy is signed by the Chairman of our Board of Directors �
•  New Employee Code of Conduct (see page 43): in 2021, we 
updated our Employee Code of Conduct, to reflect current 
industry standards and increase our focus on areas such as 
community engagement �
•  New Supplier Code of Conduct (see page 53): in 2021, we 
launched our Supplier Code of Conduct, replacing the Business 
Partner Code of Conduct, in line with our commitments to 
international standards, and with an increased focus on topics 
such as conflict minerals � 
•  New Conflict Minerals Policy (see page 53): in 2022, we published 
a new Conflict Minerals Policy, signed by the Head of Global 
Procurement � 
2. Due diligence processes: 
•  Updated Project-Level Social Due Diligence (see pages 59-61): in 
2020, we updated our Social Due Diligence system to address 
human rights issues raised in the HRA recommendations and to 
reflect learnings from projects in emerging markets �
•  New Conflicts Minerals Program (see pages 56-57): in 2021, we 
created our Conflicts Mineral Programme following the 
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's 
(OECD) Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of 
Minerals � To date, we have completed two conflict minerals 
assessments based on supplier reporting, and are in the process 
of completing a third �
•  Revised Supplier Risk Matrix (see page 53): In 2022 � we initiated 
the modification of our matrix to help identify suppliers at high 
sustainability risk � We aim to include more risk indices on factors 
such as freedom of opinion and expression, indigenous peoples' 
rights and the ethical behaviour of firms � 
3. Grievance and remedy: 
• Incident management system updated: in 2022, we migrated 
data from our IT system to a new provider to manage grievances 
on our operations � As part of this process, the Community Incident 
section was strengthened and learnings from previous cases were 
applied� 
• Operational grievance reviewed: in 2022, our organisational 
grievance mechanism underwent a review against the UN Guiding 
Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) effectiveness 
criteria and our new community incident categories �
Future improvements to be implemented based on 2022 HRA
While we have made advances on key issues, our 2022 assessment 
has identified new focus areas for us � Our key actions following the 
2022 HRA will be: 
• Improving human rights governance structure: we will work on 
creating better human rights governance at different parts of  
our value chain � This will ensure salient human rights issues are 
understood, recognised, prioritised, and well-managed across  
our operations �  
• Rare-Earths Usage Mapping: In 2023, we aim to finalise an 
analysis of our use of rare earth minerals to further develop our 
risk frameworks�  
•  Expanding risk matrix assessment to indirect suppliers: based on 
the updates conducted on our matrix for sustainability risk for 
direct suppliers, we aim to implement the same principles for our 
indirect suppliers, who have a separate risk-based approach �

Our approach
Human Rights Policy
Our commitments
Our Human Rights policy outlines our commitment to respecting 
human rights wherever we are present � Our responsibility to respect 
human rights includes supporting the following international 
instruments in our policy: the UN International Bill of Human Rights, 
ILO’s eight fundamental conventions, the UN Guiding Principles on 
Business and Human Rights (UNGPs), and the OECD’s Guideline for 
Multinational Enterprises � We have also been a signatory to the UN 
Global Compact since 2009 � 
Where local laws and regulations set lower standards, but do not 
prohibit applying international standards that exceed local laws, we 
abide by international standards �
We considered various internal stakeholders when setting the policy, 
and engaged an international consultancy to carry out a review � The 
policy applies globally and we expect our business relations both 
upstream and downstream to respect human rights within their 
scope� The Human Rights Policy is signed by Vestas’ Board Chair, 
and is publicly available on vestas �com�
Governing our Human Rights Policy
Our Compliance & CSR function oversees the policy and works 
day-to-day to implement it within our internal processes across  
the organisation � 
The commitments in our Human Rights Policy are embedded into 
several other policies and processes including our Employee & 
Supplier Codes of Conduct, due diligence processes, our Social Due 
Diligence process on wind farms, and in the assessment of our direct 
and indirect suppliers � 
Implementation is carried out in collaboration with different 
stakeholders across the company at various levels � For example, 
with Group Sustainability at a strategic level, with Sustainable 
Procurement on a supplier level, and with the legal, sales and 
construction teams at the wind farm project level, to name a few �
Communication and training
Continuing to improve the understanding of human rights and how 
we can have an adverse impact is important to us � We prioritise 
raising awareness of the Human Rights Policy among our employees 
through internal communication and training � In 2022, we hosted a 
company-wide round-table webinar about human rights manage -
ment at Vestas � For the past three years, on Human Rights Day (10 
December), we have shared a company-wide article and visual 
material to emphasise our commitment to the UNGPs �
We also work collaboratively to promote the respect of human rights 
in business � For example, we are a member of the Nordic Business 
Network for Human Rights, the UN Global Compact Human Rights 
Network, and BSR, a sustainable business network, as well as taking 
part in the annual annual UN Forum on Business and Human Rights �

Whistleblower platform: EthicsLine
EthicsLine is our whistleblower platform that allows our employees 
and partners to report violations of the Vestas Codes of Conduct, 
applicable laws, and Vestas policies and procedures � Since 2007 , 
EthicsLine has helped ensure that such violations are always 
brought forward and dealt with appropriately � 
The main purpose of EthicsLine is to provide our employees, 
partners, or anyone associated with the company a place to report 
unethical behaviour or practices observed at work � EthicsLine also 
provides guidance for employees who may find themselves in an 
ethical dilemma � 
The EthicsLine Policy highlights our zero-tolerance approach to 
retaliation against reporters raising a case in good faith, whether the 
report is ultimately substantiated or not � The same applies to 
individuals who cooperate as part of an EthicsLine investigation (for 
example as witnesses) � 
EthicsLine is hosted on a secure external website where anyone can 
raise a concern without fear of repercussion � The platform allows 
reporters to remain anonymous, except in instances when this would 
be specifically prohibited by law � Subject to applicable laws, all 
matters reported through EthicsLine are investigated thoroughly, 
and everyone involved is treated fairly � 
To support the availability of EthicsLine, the platform is accessible 
publicly on Vestas �com, on the Vestas Compliance app on the App 
Store and Google Store, and internally on our intranet � EthicsLine is 
also available by phone in the United States � To raise further 
awareness of EthicsLine and how to use it, several training sessions, 
communication initiatives, and webinars are conducted across 
Vestas� Our training material, which has been translated into several 
languages, is available on the Code of Conduct Portal and includes 
training slides with anonymised EthicsLine cases � 
An Ethics Committee supports and supervises the EthicsLine 
function on a global and regional level, and determines, on a case 
by-case-basis, the appropriate outcome of an investigation 
including disciplinary steps and other remediation actions � 
Remediation actions are implemented and monitored by the 
relevant departments �
In 2022, a total of 539 EthicsLine cases were raised, a 16 percent 
increase from 2021� Of these cases, 137 were substantiated, 
leading to various disciplinary actions � We perceive the increase  
in EthicsLine reports as a positive sign that employees and partners 
are aware of the hotline, find it easy to use, and not the least are 
comfortable speaking up and reporting non-compliant behaviour, 
knowing that this can be done anonymously and without fear  
of retaliation �

Our approach
Employee Code of Conduct
Own workforce
The Vestas Employee Code of Conduct is our 
employees’ guide to making the right decisions�
The Code is binding to all Vestas employees and outlines the 
behaviours expected from them on topics such as Health & Safety, 
Discrimination & Harassment, Anti-Bribery & Corruption, Supplier 
Relations, Environment, Community Relations, Intellectual Property, 
Information Security, Data Privacy, Competition and Sanctions  
Law, and more � All employees are expected to act in accordance  
with the Code, however, day-to-day responsibility for ensuring its 
implementation rests with all managers at Vestas � Managers are 
expected to lead by example and drive the culture of integrity  
across the company � 
The Code is managed by our Compliance & CSR team, which works to 
update the document and develop guidance and communication on 
its contents across regions and functions� The EthicsLine function, our 
whistleblower system, provides insights on whether the Code has 
been violated in specific reported incidents� 
The Code is communicated through various channels, including 
mandatory topic -specific micro-learnings released at various times 
during the year, voluntary awareness webinars, trainings, and 
through our internal Code of Conduct Portal � Since the update of our 
Employee Code of Conduct in 2021, five mandatory topic -specific 
micro-learnings have been released �The Code of Conduct Portal is a 
central resource where employees can access the Code in eighteen 
languages, download training and communication material, and 
access pre-recorded training sessions � To equip managers with tools 
to implement the code, training toolkits designed to facilitate a 
conversation around the different topics in the Code of Conduct are 
available in the portal �
We have been a signatory to the United Nations (UN) Global 
Compact since 2009 and we are committed to the UN Guiding 
Principles on Business and Human Rights � The Code follows the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Labour 
Organization (ILO) Declaration of Fundamental Principles and Rights 
at Work, and the OECD’s Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises’ 
recommendations on responsible business conduct � When local laws 
and regulations set lower standards but do not prohibit applying 
international standards that exceed local laws and regulations, we 
apply international standards �
The international standards embedded in the Code commit us to 
respecting the human rights of not only our stakeholders, but also 
our workers – including their labour rights � To this end, our Code 
expresses zero tolerance to the use of modern slavery, forced labour, 
or human trafficking � For more information on how we engage with 
potentially affected stakeholders and provide remedy, see page 61� 
The Code was drafted in consultation with external and internal 
stakeholders, representing different regions and functions across 
the organisation �

As a responsible company, it is our obligation and 
responsibility to ensure that our 28,000 employ-
ees go home to their families, their loved ones 
and friends as safe and healthy as they started 
their workday at Vestas� 
Every day, our employees manufacture, install, and service wind 
farms all over the world � Without exception, they always operate 
under the principle of ‘safety first’ � We want to become the safest 
company in the energy industry, so we are committed to reducing 
our Total Recordable Injury Rate (TRIR) to 1� 5 by 2025, and to 0�6  
by 2030� 
TRIR includes ‘restricted work injuries’ and ‘medical treatment 
injuries’ in addition to Lost Time Injuries (LTI's) � The TRIR therefore 
provides greater insight to help inform our activities and initiatives � 
Our focus on TRIR also indicates the maturity of our safety journey, 
underscoring the fact that we have reduced our Lost Time Injury 
Rate (LTIR) by 25 percent over the last five years � 
The scope of our TRIR reporting has included Vestas employees and 
supervised contractors � Going forward from 12 January 2023, we 
will include all contractors under our operational control � The 
consequence will be our baseline will rise; however, we are still 
committed to reducing our TRIR by 2025 (please see page 58 for 
more information on contractor safety) �

To reach our ambitious target, in the second half of 2022 we have 
initiated a new HSE management system, which is simpler, clearer, 
and more systematic � The system takes a risk-based approach, in 
line with the new ISO 45001 standards � It will form the backbone of 
our approach to addressing HSE risks, and is fundamental to 
effective HSE management, which must be integrated into the 
operational process and considered in all future development 
projects � It will be mandatory for all regions and functions to comply 
with this systematic approach, which sets the minimum bar for how 
we manage our risks in our operations � With this in place, we will be 
able to address operational control through critical control checks, 
and an assurance methodology including the training of certified 
auditors �
In 2023, we will also focus on HSE leadership and awareness, 
including personal safety action plans, global campaigns and 
enhanced training products � These programmes will establish a 
systematic approach to driving our vision and ambition to establish 
a culture where safety is second nature � The bottom line is that 
safety needs to be a natural part of our working culture � To drive the 
awareness, we have started developing dashboards providing 
intelligence on HSE performance down to the individual site for 
managers throughout the organisational levels � 
Our safety performance in 2022
Our TRIR increased to 3 �3, from 3�1 in 2021� While we have 
managed to reduce our TRIR by 69 percent since 2012, we remain 
committed to maintaining progress and meeting our 2025 and 
2030 targets � 
During the year, our LTIR per million working hours increased to 1� 2� 
We continued to focus on incidents with high actual severity or high 
potential severity � We will now ensure that we learn from these 
incidents and share the lessons across the organisation to prevent 
re-occurrence � Zero employee fatalities occurred in 2022 � 
Safety awareness 
Widespread awareness is integral to the management and preven -
tion of safety hazards � Since 2007 , we have run a safety awareness 
programme for employees and managers � Furthermore, safety 
training is a mandatory part of the onboarding process for all 
employees � The ultimate objective of this programme is to eliminate 
all Lost Time Injuries � To further strengthen our safety culture and 
encourage good safety behaviours, 22,497 of our employees 
participated in safety awareness training during 2022 � 
As well as participating in the safety awareness programme, senior 
management demonstrated top level commitment to safety this 
year by participating in ‘safety walks’ � A safety walk is an opportunity 
for managers to engage in constructive dialogue and discuss safe 
behaviour with employees, helping to find new ways of improving 
safety within specific job environments � 
Focusing on behaviour 
We have identified behaviour, specifically a lack of focus and 
awareness, as primary causes of workplace incidents and injuries � 
Our My Team My Responsibility (MTMR) programme builds on a 
strong foundation of employee engagement with safety issues � 
Frontline managers and supervisors work with their teams to 
identify the behaviours they want to improve together, then take 
ownership as a team to drive change and improvement � 
The Vestas Behavioural Change (VBC) programme is an employ -
ee-led safety observation initiative � It actively encourages employ -
ees to observe and assess each other’s behaviour while carrying out 
specific work-related tasks, with recognition and reward for good 
safety behaviour � Equally, any risky behaviours identified during the 
observation are stopped, adjusted, and reassessed to ensure risk is 
mitigated � The programme also encourages open, honest, and 
constructive safety dialogue between colleagues � It emphasises the 
collective responsibility of Vestas employees to promote safe 
behaviour across the company �

Attracting and recruiting top talent
We aim to attract, develop, and retain top talent in the market and to 
become employer of choice in the sustainable energy industry by 
2023� We kick-started this journey in 2021 as we developed a new 
Employer Value Proposition (EVP) as a strategic effort to strengthen 
our employer brand � Throughout 2022, focus has been on unlocking 
the EVP through various initiatives such as reinforced collaboration 
with relevant educational institutions, Great Place To Work certifica -
tions in selected key markets, a new employee ambassador 
programme, an increased level of employee stories on both external 
and internal channels, and further regional initiatives �

Only by enabling the success of our employees can  
we succeed as a company� We want to create an  
attractive and inclusive workplace, where our employees 
feel valued and supported throughout their employment�  
It is a continuous journey, and we are aiming to constantly 
improve our processes across the employee lifecycle  
to allow our employees to reach their full potential�
Kerstin Knapp – Executive Vice President, Chief People & Culture Officer
To become an employer of choice we must also build accurate 
assessment processes and diversity measures into the recruitment 
process� To ensure we promote and sustain an inclusive culture 
where diversity is valued, our recruitment process follows a 
multi-stage evaluation of the candidate to ensure bias mitigation 
and accurate skillset evaluation � Various platforms and tools are 
utilised, including Develop Diverse to improve inclusive written 
communication in elements such as job adverts, and mandatory 
psychometric assessments for all white-collar positions to help us 
better understand the candidates in the process �
Onboarding
In a world where work environments are rapidly changing, the 
onboarding of new colleagues has become more crucial than ever 
before� So, in 2022, we began creating an integrated and engaging 
end-to-end onboarding journey for new employees �  
As a first step, we launched an onboarding page with information 
and toolkits for new hires, managers, and buddies to support the 
orientation and induction of new colleagues � We also launched two 
e-learnings � One was created for new employees about our business, 
organisation, and culture, including presentations by members of 
the Executive Management team � The second was created for new 
people managers � 
To further strengthen the onboarding experience and to help guide 
our initiatives and actions in the coming years, we launched a new 
onboarding survey in November 2022 and defined the strategic 
mission of onboarding at Vestas: "Create a smooth and engaging 
start at Vestas � Onboarding strengthens the sense of belonging by 
bringing new employees, managers, buddies, and colleagues 
together to provide a good start �"
Performance and development
Our Continuous Performance and Development (CPD) process is a 
key part of the employee lifecycle � It works to support the perfor -
mance and development of our employees on a continual basis, 
providing them with the opportunity to own their development, 
supported by Vestas � 
The CPD process is our global performance and development 
concept, and works to ensure that all employees are aware of what is 
expected of them and of their contribution to Vestas � It also ensures 
that every employee has a specific and individual development plan, 
with clear performance objectives set on an annual basis in 
collaboration with their manager � This provides the continuous 
feedback and dialogues that enable our employees to grow and 
perform both as people and as part of Vestas �
People Review is a part of our CPD process and provides further 
insights into the performance and potential of employees at every 
corporate leadership level�  Here, each management team must 
reflect on its employees, discuss their development, and identify 
who is eligible for nomination to our talent programmes � In the 
programmes, the focus is on preparing participants to move into 
critical positions, thereby future-proofing the organisation �

Building the talent pipeline
To continue to grow both our organisation and our people, we must 
ensure continuous alignment between our business needs and 
long-term outlook and our current and potential talent, while also 
enabling internal mobility and encouraging leadership capabilities � 
To support these efforts, we conduct various in-house talent and 
leadership programmes, where participants have been identified as 
high-potential employees:
• The Vestas Graduate Programme  is a two-year international 
programme aimed at attracting and developing talented young 
professionals who aspire to hold future key positions in the 
company� Participants work on two different assignments 
throughout the programme, with a progressive increase in 
challenge and responsibility � The 2022 cohort comprised 45 
young professionals located worldwide, of whom 47 percent were 
women and 53 percent were men �
• The Regional Talent Programme serves the mid and short-term 
business needs of our regional business units, supporting 
selected employees with tailored development opportunities � 
Participants are identified during the people review process and 
nominated as part of individual performance evaluations � The 
10-month programme accelerates, stretches, and develops the 
participants to help fill the regional leadership pipeline across all 
leadership career tracks, resulting in higher promotion rates of 
participants compared with peer groups � In 2022, 34 percent of 
the participants were women �
• The Rising Executives Programme focuses on developing global 
leaders with executive potential�  The 10-month programme 
offers tailored development opportunities, learning activities and 
assignments to prepare participants for future leadership 
positions globally � Participants benefit from a significantly higher 
promotion rate compared to peer groups � In 2022, 21 percent of 
the participants were women �
• The Vestas Leadership Forum , launched for the first time in 2021 
and planned to continue on an annual basis, gathers our most 
senior leaders across functions and locations to unite in conversa -
tions and development � The forum itself comprises strategic 
briefings and inspiring presentations on key topics, such as 
customer partnerships, servicing our future, efficient scalability, 
future technology, and leading with a global and inclusive mindset �

Learning
We give our employees the opportunity to learn and grow by 
providing them with the tools to power their development in the key 
areas and competencies that we all need to master at Vestas � To 
democratise development opportunities across all geographies and 
functions, we provide blended learning offerings, so that each 
employee can choose the learning format that suits them the best � 
This includes game-based courses, audio- and e-books, and online 
on-demand or facilitator-led courses �
To further engage employees, we continuously post challenges and 
fun competitions in our Power Your Development Community � 
Through all these initiatives, we encourage employees to embrace 
self-led development and to own their career journey �
Recognition
As well as development opportunities and a competitive salary, we 
offer our employees a range of further benefits � Depending on local 
market conditions, we offer a pension, insurance plans, health 
insurance, subsidised lunch, gym access, and work-life policies, such 
as flexible working arrangements � We also provide competitive 
vacation policies � Our compensation packages are benchmarked 
against local market salaries for each position, ensuring equal and 
fair pay regardless of social identity � Our annual salary reviews are 
linked to performance evaluation to help us achieve strong align -
ment between performance, pay, and the external environment � We 
also commission external audits on pay equity, investigating pay 
levels in relation to gender, nationality, and age � 
A unique element of our remuneration scheme is our global bonus 
programme � Every employee at Vestas is part of the programme and 
rewarded for annual company performance � We use bonus score -
cards to calculate the exact amount to be allocated each year, and 
bonuses are paid out when and if the minimum success criteria for 
Group profits are met � 
To aid the ambition of carbon neutrality by 2030, we have updated 
our benefit car programme � As of 2022, we only offer electric 
vehicles (EV's) � By 2025, our benefit car fleet will be com- 
prised exclusively of zero-emission vehicles � This has been accompa -
nied by infrastructure to charge EV's at many office locations � 
Employee survey
In 2022, we continued to run our Employee Engagement Survey � 
Continuously listening to our people and acting on their feedback is 
crucial to ensure a workplace that meets the needs and demands of 
our workforce and creates an environment where people thrive 
every day� Our Employee Engagement Survey is run twice annually 
and explores how our people feel about their daily lives in and 
around the workplace � 
The 2022 fourth quarter survey achieved a response rate of 89 
percent, a two percent increase from the 2021 end-year survey � In 
the survey, we achieved an overall satisfaction and engagement 
score (eSat) of 73, stable from 2021� The fourth quarter survey also 
showed an increased employee net promoter score (eNPS) � Overall, 
most of the scores in the survey improved, including areas such as 
empowerment, manager, feedback, growth, and recognition � The 
score on decision making decreased by one point � Along with the 
survey scores, the more than 42,000 comments received in the 
survey will guide our focus areas to continue our journey towards 
becoming employer of choice �
Exit
When our employees leave the company, we want them to leave 
satisfied, aware of the impact they have made within the company 
and in helping to drive the global energy transition � Their departure 
from the company can come in many forms � Retirement is a key 
sub-stage of the Vestas lifecycle � While this is still categorised as an 
‘exit’ from the company, we work to ensure the right procedures and 
conditions are in place when one of our employees retires � In other 
instances, employees may choose to submit a resignation � In this 
case, it is crucial for us to understand the reasons for their resigna -
tion, which is why we updated our Exit Survey in May 2022, enabling 
us to improve Vestas’ standing as an employer of choice � Finally, if 
we are forced to terminate a contract with an employee, we always 
do our best to provide equitable market-level severance packages �

Diversity, Equity,  
Inclusion, & Belonging
In 2022, we continued our efforts to ensure an 
inclusive working culture across all our business 
functions and regions� T o take this to the next 
level, we have decided to expand our focus from 
Diversity and Inclusion to Diversity, Equity, 
Inclusion, and Belonging (DEIB)� 
Ensuring a diverse and equitable workplace where all our colleagues 
feel included and have a strong sense of belonging is essential to 
enhance employee wellbeing and attract and retain talent � This is 
why we strive to be the most inclusive workplace within the 
renewable energy sector �
Gender representation 
We understand diversity in the broadest sense and continuously 
work to expand our diversity focus � However, as 14�7 percent of all 
our colleagues are women, gender remains a key focus area for us � 
We have therefore set targets for a more gender-balanced leader -
ship: 30 percent female representation in leadership positions by 
2030, and 25 percent by 2025 � By the end of 2022, we are set to 
meet our annual target of 22 percent, as our gender balance in 
corporate leadership has increased from 21 percent to 23 percent 
women over the last year � This improvement was supported by the 
increased focus on DEIB in 2022 � To continue this journey, we have 
also recently updated our DEIB Policy �
In terms of gender representation on our board, we reached our 
gender balance targets in 2022, when the shareholders elected 
three female and five male board members � With the inclusion of 
employee-elected Directors, these figures will rise to five female and 
seven male board members �
We have also introduced a gender-balance target for our senior 
management of 25 percent of the underrepresented gender by 
2025, to meet new Danish regulations that will come into effect in 
2023� We know that to meet our senior management and corporate 
leadership targets, we must actively build our talent pipeline 
through our talent programmes � 
Ethnicity representation
In the coming years, we also intend to set targets for diversity that 
truly represent the many regions that we work in � We will start by 
introducing ethnicity as an additional diversity focus area in 2023 � 
Unlike gender, we cannot set global targets for ethnicity due to the 
European General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) � However, we 
will use nationality as a proxy to track our global progress, while 
encouraging our regions to set their own regional targets where it is 
legally permissible to record our employees’ ethnicity (e �g� in the 
USA)� While we will not be able to set ethnicity targets globally, our 
awareness-raising campaigns and initiatives will focus on ethnicity �
One such example is our recently entered partnership with The 
Professional Women of Colour (ProWoc) Network, a non-profit 
organi sation that offers career and personal development opportu -
nities for women of colour seeking to increase their visibility and 
impact in Denmark �

An equitable and inclusive employee lifecycle
We know that working on diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging 
requires a detailed assessment of every single aspect of our 
employee lifecycle structures and processes to ensure an equitable 
meritocracy where we mitigate bias � We have therefore taken steps 
to initiate a detailed assessment of our attraction and recruitment 
processes, onboarding, learning and development, Continuous 
Performance and Development dialogues, promotion processes, 
and talent selection � We already engage in many efforts within all 
these areas (e �g� unconscious bias training for recruiters, language 
software to aid inclusive communication in job ads, inclusive 
leadership training and exit surveys) � We know this is an area which 
requires continuous improvement, and it will therefore remain an 
ongoing project � 
We have also continued to focus on pay equity � This work follows on 
from the implementation in late 2020 of a robust Vestas job 
framework � The framework enables the evaluation and comparison 
of job roles and provides a clear view of pay equity across the 
organisation � We also continued to gather insights, both through 
research and learnings from pioneers, on how to move forward with 
pay equity from a strategic and tactical perspective � This included 
aligning our pay equity efforts with the broader DEIB agenda � To 
further support our wider People & Culture community, we created 
tools and guidelines to ensure conscious decisions are made when 
setting pay, and we have started our journey to train our People & 
Culture community in pay equity �
Embedding inclusion in our culture: inclusive leadership training
We aim to create a true culture of inclusion where all our colleagues 
feel a sense of belonging, are able to be their true selves, and can 
reach their full potential � To do so, we need to enable all our people 
managers to role-model inclusive leadership and allyship � For this 
reason, we have decided to roll out mandatory inclusive leadership 
training for all our people managers � We aim to have trained 80 
percent of all our people managers by the end of 2023, starting with 
senior management � As of 2022, we are well ahead in reaching this 
goal� After the pilot for the training was successfully carried out in 
June 2022 with our management team in Taiwan, we began to roll 
out the actual training in August 2022 to our regional management 
teams� Latin America, North America, and Northern Central Europe 
were among the first to complete their training in December 2022 �

While all functional management teams are scheduled to have

until the end of 2023 � Similarly, our inclusive leadership training is 
also an embedded module across our talent programmes, such as 
Rising Executives and the Regional Talent Programme, and was an 
extensive part of the Vestas Leadership Forum 2022 �
Global DEIB Team & Regional initiatives
2022 has seen great progress for DEIB � Most notably, we have for 
the first time brought together all our informal DEIB representatives 
across our regions and functions under the umbrella of the Global 
DEIB Team� The team connects DEIB representatives and agents 
across our regions to exchange cross-regional knowledge, share 
best practices, support one another in DEIB initiatives, and discuss 
regional challenges and how to address them � The team was 
launched in August 2022, currently comprises 45 members and is 
steadily growing � We currently have more than 50 different 
initiatives in our five regions, and the number of initiatives is 
expected to grow steadily as a result of the synergy created by the 
Global DEIB Team�

DEIB Mission Statement  
 
At Vestas, we believe that a diverse and inclusive 
workforce is vital for accelerating the green 
energy transition globally � We know that our 
differences make us stronger, more innovative, 
and better equipped to address the challenges of 
the future � Therefore, we are committed to 
making sure that all potential, future, and current 
Vestas employees are guaranteed equal 
opportunities and fair treatment regardless of 
their background � Everyone must feel safe, 
valued, and a sense of belonging, and know that 
their voice will be heard � Together, we will keep 
moving forward on the journey to become 
sustainable in everything we do�
Our North American region has steadily worked on its DEIB aware -
ness-raising and training efforts, as well as supporting employees 
through different resource groups � This is largely made possible by 
the region's well-established DEIB Committee, which continues to 
drive all of these different efforts with the strong support of its 
management �
Similarly, our Latin American region, supported by its management, 
has begun transforming its DEIB taskforce into a robust DEIB 
Steering Committee that will continue to forge employee resource 
groups, as well as awareness-raising efforts and communications � 
Our Mediterranean and Asia Pacific regions are following suit and 
are in the process of establishing a DEIB Committee that can drive 
similar ongoing and new initiatives � The Global DEIB Team will 
support them with feedback from regions where such committees 
have already been established �
Finally, our Northern and Central European region is in the process of 
establishing a DEIB taskforce to identify and drive initiatives �
In short, 2022 was the year when we firmly placed DEIB on our 
agenda across all our regions � We will continue to support this 
agenda from a global perspective in the years to come �
External Partnerships
As part of our ambition to become an employer of choice and the 
most inclusive workplace within the renewable energy sector, we 
have initiated consulting support and several strategic industry 
partnerships � Globally, we have engaged in the Mærsk Gender 
Career Equity Network (a cross-industry network to advance gender 
equity), and locally, we have engaged with Green Power Denmark’s 
Diversity Taskforce � 
We have also continued our partnership with Above & Beyond’s 
Diversity Council, a strategic alliance of global, Nordic -based 
companies, which seeks to promote diversity and inclusion around 
the world � As part of this, for the second year in a row, we also 
participated in the Lead the Future role model campaign that seeks 
to attract more women into STEM � Similarly, we have monthly 
consultations with BSR to stay up to date with the latest DEIB 
developments around the world �
While we are making positive change towards diversity, equity, 
inclusion, and belonging, this will be an ongoing journey � We are 
thrilled to continue working towards being the most inclusive 
workplace within the renewable energy industry � 
 
T o truly ensure DEIB at Vestas, we need to embrace a culture of 
mutual growth, respect, and acceptance where DEIB becomes a 
living, breathing thing in every corner of the business� Rolling 
out inclusive leadership training for all our people managers 
and establishing a Global DEIB T eam are some of our first steps 
to move us one step closer to achieving this goal�

Suppliers are the backbone of our ability to 
develop, deliver, and service our sustainable 
energy solutions� 
We engage with suppliers around the world including direct, upstream 
suppliers who manufacture the turbine components and materials 
delivered to Vestas factories and our external suppliers � We also 
engage with indirect, downstream suppliers that deliver products 
and services to our factories and service sites and suppliers that 
perform services at wind farms �
To work directly with our suppliers on ESG concerns, we have 
embedded a Sustainable Procurement team within our Global 
Procurement function � The priorities established by Sustainable 
Procurement are enacted through Regional Procurement Officers, 
our supplier onboarding qualification process, onsite assessments 
for all direct suppliers, and assessments of indirect suppliers based 
on a risk evaluation conducted by our Supplier Quality & 
Development (SQD) team � 
 Policies for  
value chain 
workers
Workers in the value chain By integrating sustainability requirements into our onboarding  
and auditing processes, we aim to partner with our suppliers in 
building a sustainable and resilient supply base, attuned to local 
needs and conditions � 
Based on our Materiality Assessment and Human Rights 
Assessment, the most salient risks identified in the supply chain 
include occupational health & safety, sourcing from high-risk and 
conflict affected areas, forced labour and modern slavery, child 
labour and juvenile work, and the supply chain in general � 
In addition to our Human Rights Policy (see page 41), we supplement 
the management of identified risks related to value chain workers 
with the Vestas Conflict Minerals Policy and the Vestas Supplier 
Code of Conduct �
The Conflict Minerals Policy  was enacted in 2022 � We do not source 
minerals or metals directly � However, we do source parts and 
components from our suppliers which might contain potential 
conflict minerals (Tin, Tantalum, Tungsten and Gold) � The policy is 
aligned with the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible 
Supply Chains of Minerals and outlines our expectations to suppliers 
regarding responsible minerals sourcing �
 
The Vestas Supplier Code of Conduct outlines our expectations to 
suppliers in four main areas: Human Rights, Working with Integrity, 
Respecting the Environment, and Fair Business Practices � 
The Supplier Code of Conduct applies to all Vestas suppliers, and is 
aligned with our commitments to the UN Global Compact principles � 
It is also based on international standards, including the 
International Bill of Human Rights, the eight core conventions of the 
International Labour Organization, and the UN Guiding Principles on 
Business and Human Rights � It encompasses all applicable areas 
from the Human Rights and Conflict Minerals policies and sets the 
mandatory requirements for our suppliers � It is crucial that the 
health and safety of everyone involved in turbine production, 
installation, and service is always protected � Thus, a specific section 
of the Supplier Code of Conduct covers our requirements related to 
health and safety � 
The above policies are made public on vestas �com, and the Supplier 
Code of Conduct is an integrated part of the purchase agreement 
with suppliers � All new suppliers must commit to the code as a 
pre-requisite for transacting with Vestas � This is accomplished 
through the signing of purchase agreements between Vestas and 
our suppliers �
We always welcome questions or comments from our suppliers 
related to the Supplier Code of Conduct, and see this dialogue as a 
way to ensure understanding of our compliance requirements � In 
autumn 2022, three webinars were organised with a total of 294 
participants � The aim was to give an understanding of our overall 
sustainability strategy and communicate our expectations of 
suppliers � A specific webinar covered the social aspects of the 
Supplier Code of Conduct �

Managing a responsible supply chain through ongoing audits
The framework below describes the process covering: supplier 
onboarding, including due diligence, supplier business assessment 
(SBA), and high-risk identification models for both direct and indirect 
suppliers, which then result in onsite audits � To monitor progress, 
supplier account managers conduct monthly supplier reviews using 
a supplier scorecard to record dialogues and track progress �

Ongoing monitoring and dialogue
Quarterly submission of the Safety & Sus-
tainability Survey, along with sanctions and 
ethics screening, is followed by a monthly

Vestas Sustainability Report 2022
SocialIn brief General GovernanceEnvironment Sustainability data Appendix
Workers in the value chain
Indirect suppliers
Onsite audits are part of our overall due diligence process � Onsite 
audits for indirect suppliers are conducted by a third party service 
provider, who ensures that the auditing team is competent and 
trained within this area, which can be sensitive � Interviews conduct -
ed with value chain workers provides employees the opportunity to 
be open about actual working conditions, while at the same time 
ensuring transparency �
Generally, an onsite audit will also involve a meeting with a worker 
and/or Union-representative, which increases transparency and the 
potential for verification of findings during a document review or 
factory tour � We do not generally engage directly with workers in the 
supply chain, but we will request corrective actions if negative 
impact is disclosed during audits � 
Direct suppliers
Our own teams from Supplier & Quality Development (SQD) conduct 
onsite audits for direct suppliers � These audits are generally 
performed as an integrated management system assessment and 
based upon the completed SBA-questionnaire (Supplier Business 
Assessment) by the specific supplier � The applicable audit protocol 
covers 14 questions on the Code of Conduct, including human rights, 
labour rights, working hours, wages, and the grievance mechanism 
for workers to raise their concerns � Validation of answers is achieved 
by reviewing supporting evidence for each question and engaging in 
dialogue with the supplier management team �
In 2022, we initiated the revision of our risk matrix for direct 
suppliers with the aim to strengthen it by including more risk indices 
within Human Rights � A "Sustainability Risk Supplier" is defined by 
their potential to cause an adverse social and/or environmental 
impact, while also considering our dependency on the supplier � Thus, 
the highest risk involves the greatest potential adverse impact 
combined with a high level of dependency � To determine these risks, 
we are using country risk data, commodity risk, and specific 
integrated ESG factors � In 2023, we plan to include the following 
new risk indices for indirect suppliers: freedom of opinion and 
expression, indigenous peoples' rights, and ethical behaviour of 
firms� 
Supply chain auditing target
Our target for onsite assessment is 100 percent for high-risk 
suppliers identified for each business unit within a 12-month period � 
We assess direct suppliers and inform business units internally of 
applicable high-risk suppliers � The internal business units are then 
responsible for either conducting separate onsite or online audits or 
obtaining recent assessment data � For indirect suppliers, we arrange 
third party audits � We believe in dialogue and supplier engagement 
and target that each identified non-conformity is followed with a 
corrective action plan to mitigate negative impact �

Results in the year
In 2022, we assessed and audited our suppliers in the following ways:
• We conducted more than 3,200 due diligence assessments for 
potential suppliers, prior to the supplier onboarding process �
• We commissioned 28 sustainability audits from third parties � Of 
these, 19 were performed onsite, and 9 were conducted online 
due to current pandemic restrictions in certain areas � 
• Our own teams also conducted 55 onsite supplier assessments � 
52 scored above 70 percent, which is an acceptable score based 
on our risk methodology � For the 3 suppliers that scored below 70 
percent, improvement tasks were defined and agreed upon by 
Vestas and Supplier, or alternative suppliers were found � 
• We reached 100 percent of our onsite assessment targets for 
high-risk direct suppliers � By adding ad-hoc audits and investiga -
tions, we aim to reduce negative impacts on supply chain workers � 
More than 80 percent of non-conformities were closed within 12 
months and the remaining percentage were in the process of 
concluding a corrective action plan at the time of this reporting �
Conflict minerals management
We conduct additional assessments on suppliers who may be at risk 
of procuring conflict minerals � In 2022, we completed our second 
conflict minerals programme and surveyed 500 suppliers using a 
third party supply chain data management solution � Supplier 
responses were submitted by using the Conflict Minerals Reporting 
Template (CMRT)� The survey results showed that suppliers who 
participated in both the 2021 and 2022 programmes improved 
their assessment score by transitioning from high to lower risk 
smelters � Supplier response rates also increased from 81 percent in 
2021 to 89 percent in 2022� The aim of our conflict minerals 
programme is to increase the transparency of our own sourcing, to 
educate our supply chain on avoiding the procurement of conflict 
minerals, and to encourage suppliers to establish their own 
responsible sourcing programmes � 
Rare earth elements
Rare earth elements occur naturally and, once mined and processed, 
can be used in a variety of industrial applications � These include 
permanent magnets in hybrid car motors and other high-tech 
applications � We use rare earth elements in the tower magnets of all 
new turbine models, in permanent-magnet generators in the older 
GridStreamer™ models, in the EnVentus™ platform, and in smaller 
quantities throughout many magnets and electronic components 
found in our turbines � 
The majority of rare earth minerals are found in the generators of 
turbines � In permanent-magnet generators, there are two types of 
turbine drive train concepts: geared drive trains and gearless direct 
drive generators � The amount of rare earth elements used in geared 
drive trains is up to 10 times lower than the amounts used in direct 
drive generators drivetrains � Today, all Vestas turbines are based on 
technology using the less rare earth intensive geared drive trains � 
We use rare earth elements in our turbines because they make 
generators more efficient and more grid-compatible, improving 
overall performance � They also enable us to reduce the overall size of 
the generator and power-train � This means we use fewer resources, 
such as steel and other structural materials, which in turn helps to 
reduce our carbon footprint � Furthermore, compared to previous 
models, our most recent EnVentus™ turbine uses significantly fewer 
light rare earth materials per MW � In this variant, we have also 
eliminated the use of heavy rare earth materials in the generator 
altogether� 
However, one of the gaps identified in our Human Rights 
Assessment (see page 39) related to rare earth minerals � In 2022, 
we initiated a detailed mapping of our rare earth mineral use in 
specific wind turbine platforms � We expect to finalise the analysis in 
2023 and use the results to further develop our risk frameworks and 
management of these materials �

Workers in the value chain
Process and channels for engaging with value chain workers 
 and channels
According to our Supplier Code of Conduct, all suppliers are 
expected to have their own reporting system in place � Supply chain 
workers can use EthicsLine (see page 42) to raise any concerns they 
may have� Cases raised via EthicsLine by a supply chain workers are 
handed over to the applicable department(s) responsible for the 
scope of the raised concern � As such, cases from value chain workers 
will not follow the standard governance for reported cases � Instead, 
they will be handled separately in compliance with applicable 
processes for a sustainable supply chain by Sustainable 
Procurement � We have a zero-tolerance approach to retaliation 
outlined in the EthicsLine Policy �
In 2022, no reports have been shared for further investigation 
related to concerns raised about supply chain workers � We aim to 
use our implemented processes to effectively reduce, and try to 
eliminate, risk to supply chain workers � Our target is that any concern 
reported via EthicsLine is investigated and managed thoroughly � 
Supply chain planning and forecast sharing
We share forecasts with our suppliers to reduce the risk of contribut -
ing to or causing material negative impact to the supply chain 
workers � In 2022, we successfully implemented the latest module of 
our Digital Supply Chain Collaboration tool, which enables us to work 
more efficiently with our suppliers, receive real time data on 
deliveries and orders, and collaborate with our suppliers on 
forecasts and upcoming activities in our supply chain � 
Our forecasts serve as a planning tool, which also enables our 
suppliers to estimate the necessary materials and the work force 
needed to fill our orders � However, it is important to underline that 
the forecasts are a rough estimate, and final purchase orders may 
vary in volume once placed �
We also participate in WindEurope’s supply chain taskforce, helping 
the industry map supply chain risks, and we take a collective 
approach to mitigate these risks using our collateral leverage � 
Our overall framework is established with the intention of support -
ing Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 8 Decent Work and 
Economic Growth, specifically targets 8� 5, 8�7 and 8�8�

Supplier Safety & Sustainability Survey
Our supplier performance evaluations are based on Supplier 
Scorecards � The Safety & Sustainability (S&S) survey feeds into the 
scorecard and has a weight of 30 percent in the overall performance 
evaluation � 
The survey enables us to measure the maturity of suppliers in health 
& safety, environmental, and social sustainability on a quarterly 
basis� It includes, but is not limited to, questions about whether 
suppliers measure CO 2e emissions and set reduction targets for 
their activities, whether they measure and have set a target for their 
scope 3 emissions, and if they are committed to science-based 
targets to reduce CO 2e emissions� We also collect information on our 
suppliers related to the use of renewable electricity, their waste 
reduction efforts, and the amount of recycled content in products 
supplied to Vestas � 
In 2022, the Safety & Sustainability survey was distributed to 
approximately 230 key suppliers � Throughout the year, we achieved 
an average score of 83 percent across all suppliers, exceeding our 
average target score of 80 percent � By the end of 2022, our 
engagement resulted in improved sustainability performance for 
approximately 50 percent of suppliers who received the survey �
The assessment ensures we capture an overview of our supplier's 
sustainability performance and helps us prioritise our engagement � 
We conduct performance dialogues with all scorecard suppliers 
which, for low-performing suppliers from any segment, follow up on 
performance and action plans until our standards are met � 
Contractor safety 
As the safety performance of our own employees has improved 
significantly over the years, the performance of contractors has 
become an increasingly important focus area �
We continue to collaborate with external partners to drive and 
improve performance across the industry � In 2022, we began 
working on contractor safety governance � Our data shows that our 
contractors contribute a disproportionate share of our incidents 
when compared to their exposure hours � In 2023, we will strengthen 
our governance through audits and inspections � 
With the rapid expansion of the wind industry, many inexperienced 
contractors are exposed to the risks of working at heights, in tight 
spaces, with high-voltage electricity, and surrounded by high-lift 
operations � To minimise these risks, we are committed to only ever 
working with trained and competent technicians � 
Despite these efforts, three contractor fatalities occurred in 2022 � 
These incidents have been fully investigated to determine the root 
causes� In October 2022, we globally implemented a new incident 
management platform to facilitate better reporting, a more 
systematic approach to determine the root causes, and to follow 
corrective actions � We also established a set of root cause catego -
ries in our management system to better determine which root 
causes should be addressed first � 
Beginning January 2023, safety data for all contractors will be 
integrated within our HSE management system, and despite the 
expanded scope, we will maintain the same ambitious targets for 
contractors as for our own employees (see page 45) �

resettlement as the most salient human rights issues for our 
industry � We facilitate non-judicial access to remedy for internal  
and external stakeholders through our globally applied grievance 
mechanism, which enables host communities to raise concerns  
or grievances � 
Our Employee Code of Conduct includes the section ‘Our 
Responsibilites Towards Communities �' This topic sets out our 
expectations towards our own employees concerning engagement 
with host communities � We expect our employees to engage with 
and listen to host communities respectfully, in an inclusive and 
culturally appropriate way � 
Our commitment to  
respect host communities
Affected communities
In addition, our Supplier Code of Conduct includes similar provisions 
requiring our suppliers to avoid causing or contributing to negative 
impacts on host communities, to engage with and listen to commu -
nities in a respectful way, and to establish appropriate grievance 
mechanisms � Information on how we communicate with suppliers on 
our Supplier Code of Conduct can be found on page 53 � 
Furthermore, communities can register complaints via EthicsLine  
to report any concerns of potential breach of our Code of Conduct 
(see page 42)�
Social Due Diligence Process
Working together with our clients to prevent and agree on the  
most effective mitigation measures for actual or potential social 
impacts of the project benefits all parties, including local communi -
ties� Our Social Due Diligence framework is implemented globally 
and informed by the findings of our Human Rights Assessment, 
international industry practice, and international standards �  
The process is an integral part of our Sales Gate Process when 
bidding on a wind farm tender – from Qualifying, to Value 
Engineering and Negotiation � 
The methodology is applied to projects over a certain threshold 
located outside high-income OECD countries, and projects in OECD 
countries where there might be a risk of impacting indigenous 
peoples’ lands, territories, and livelihoods � In projects where 
indigenous peoples’ lands are involved, we take additional measures 
to establish whether the project has been developed in accordance 
with national law and international standards � 
Our SDD framework ensures that we identify, prevent and mitigate 
potential adverse human rights impacts on affected communities in 
a timely manner, and take their perspective into consideration in our 
decision-making processes � At the same time, we strive to enhance 
positive impacts, thereby making our projects more inclusive �

Identifying, preventing  
and mitigating social risks
The SDD process has two general phases: 
1� Identification and assessment of social risks at the tender phase�
2� Implementation of Vestas’ action plan together with project 
stakeholders � 
During the first phase we seek to establish an understanding of  
the country context in which a wind farm project is planned through 
a 'social-lens'� This is followed by an in-depth assessment of social 
issues on project-level carried out in accordance with the IFC 
Performance Standards on Environmental and Social Sustainability 
(IFC PS)� 
The assessment determines to what extent information about 
stakeholder engagement, land acquisition, local employment, cul  -
tural customs and heritage, community health and safety, or access 
to a grievance mechanism and remedy for impacted communities 
have been adequately addressed � The in-depth assessment also 
aims to determine whether there is any known past or present com  - 
munity opposition to the project or other infrastructure projects in 
the same area �
As part of this assessment, we consider whether a site visit is 
relevant to verify or collect project data � The latter is relevant where 
project data is limited for completing our social due diligence � 
We use our leverage and influence in customer dialogues to address 
our SDD findings � This ensures that we clarify any uncertainties 
linked to identified potential social risks and the division of social 
roles and responsibilities in time, prior to closure of contractual 
employer requirements � Such issues may include stakeholder 
engagement, land acquisition, local employment, cultural customs 
and heritage, community health and safety, or access to remedy for 
impacted communities and workers � 
The developer of the wind farm will, during a public consultation, 
present potential risks and how the project intends to prevent or, 
where prevention is not possible, mitigate the impact � During these 
meetings the developer gains more insight into how the public 
perceives the project � In addition, the public is given an opportunity 
to raise any concerns or expectations towards the project � 
Our SDD tool facilitates the 
review of our customer’s

Affected communities
In the case of complex projects, or those where project documenta -
tion does not meet our SDD standards, we may use external 
consultants and experts to inform our SDD � The SDD is an active 
document and can be reviewed if there are significant changes to 
the project development, construction, or service phase �
The findings of the SDD inform the second phase where we prepare 
and implement project-level social management plans, tailored to 
the risks, while also seeking to maximise local community opportu -
nities� We may decide to allocate an on-site social coordinator to 
implement social mitigation measures, which may include job 
creation and procurement of local sourcing specifically during the 
construction phase, educating affected communities about wind 
energy to dispel any myths, establishing a channel for affected 
communities to raise a concern or grievance, and/or community 
development initiatives aiming at improving the quality of life in the 
affected community � 
The frequency of our engagements with affected communities or 
their representatives varies from project to project � To see some of 
our latest community initiatives in 2022, see page 64 � 
Progress on our social management plan is reported to the customer 
on a monthly basis as part of the Health, Safety, Social and 
Environmental statistic � Therefore, our SDD is conducted in an 
ongoing basis �
Development
We are committed to engaging respectfully with the communities 
based in the areas where we plan and operate projects, to be 
sensitive to environmental and cultural values, and to make a 
positive contribution to the regions in which we operate � In Australia, 
we are a signatory of the Clean Energy Council’s Best Practice 
Charter for Renewable Energy Developments that sets out 10 
statements regarding how we engage with communities, manage 
community impacts, and advance local opportunities � In Indonesia, 
we have partnered with organisations that work through local 
schools and community-based projects to empower vulnerable 
youth and adults �
We take an active role in engaging with stakeholders such as 
landowners, agencies, and partners throughout the development 
process to ensure stakeholders get timely updates of project news 
and community members are informed of any actions that might 
relate to their property, business, or day-to-day activities � Means of 
engagement with community members and leaders in the local area 
include hosting public consultations, open houses and webinars, 
visiting local schools, and attending public events � 
Grievance mechanism and redress 
We are committed to strengthening our understanding of the 
concerns, doubts, and expectations of affected communities � 
Consequently, we have put in place an operational Grievance 
Mechanism (GM) in which an individual or group can raise concerns, 
complaints, and doubts transparently and safely � In sharing 
grievances as they arise, we can strengthen our relationship with 
affected communities and proactively engage with grievances �
The GM can take the form of various communication channels  
which may vary depending on local customs and characteristics �  
The primary channel is face-to-face communication, but we also  
use suggestion boxes, e-mail, a toll-free telephone hotline, and 
regular meetings with affected communities �
Roles and responsibilities for handling grievances are clearly  
defined between us and our customer before the project commenc -
es� Depending on the project scope, we may be responsible for 
managing concerns and grievances related to the operational 
impacts that occur during project construction, including livelihood 
issues such as dust impact, community health & safety issues such 
as road accidents, concerns about cultural heritage or customs, 
misalignment on the expected benefits of a project, security 
practices, land compensation, and other topics �
When a grievance is received, we conduct a due diligence to  
collect facts about the case, determine whether the grievance  
has merit and clarify if Vestas or any of Vestas’ contractors are 
involved � Where merit is established, Vestas will seek to remedy 
adverse impacts �
The closing timeline of a grievance will depend on each case, 
however, regardless of whether a complaint is accepted or not,  
a response to the stakeholder must be promptly provided in an 
understandable and transparent way � Vestas ensures that records 
and evidence are kept in the Vestas Incident Management  
System (IMS)�

Investing in our social license
Building a sound relationship with host communities is fundamental 
to obtain and maintain a Social License to Operate (SLO) in the wind 
farm projects to which we contribute � Unlike legal licenses or 
construction permits, it is not possible to apply for a social license � 
An SLO is awarded when a project has the ongoing approval and 
acceptance of the host community and other stakeholders �
Our global approach to the SLO helps us create financeable projects 
through the inclusion of social risks in our wind farm management � 
By working continuously with our stakeholders, such as customers 
and affected communities, we aim to understand the local context 
and build trust and acceptance in our projects� We also ensure that our 
own evaluation of potential impacts, and our approach to addressing 
these impacts, is closely aligned with our customers’ efforts �

As we work to become the global leader in sustainable energy 
solutions, we want to incorporate collaborative leadership into our 
way of doing business � Such leadership involves working closely  
with various stakeholders, including customers, partners, investors, 
contractors, and local communities, and inviting them to join us  
on our journey �
As part of our commitment, we will continue to improve disclosure 
around our quantitative and qualitative human rights performance � 
To this end, we report on the following KPIs:
65%
1.  The share of in-scope projects having undergone the SDD process
We constantly work to ensure that all projects within scope undergo 
the Social Due Diligence (SDD) process to reach our target of 100 
percent by 2025� This also means initiating SDD on projects that do 
not reach firm order intake in the reporting year � 
2.  The number of community beneficiaries reached
Our intention is to give back to the people living in the communities 
close to our operations � Our community engagement initiatives can 
range from providing access to jobs and stimulating local procure -
ment, to training, educational activities, and public infrastructure 
funding � By reporting on this KPI, we evaluate the reach of the 
initiatives in our SDD’s social management plans � 
In 2022, we continued several of our community engagement 
initiatives, reaching 7 ,572 direct beneficiaries �
With the number of beneficiaries reached in 2022, we have reached 
our 2025 target of 35,000 accumulated beneficiaries earlier than 
anticipated � Going forward, we will continue our efforts to positively 
impact local communities and adjust our future goals accordingly �
3. The number of community grievances received. 
We have an Operational Grievance Mechanism (OGM) that provides 
a transparent and fair way for those potentially impacted by a 
project to raise any concerns they might have � It is an integral part of 
our approach to obtain and maintain our SLO, thereby reducing the 
risks we face �
In 2022, we received 13 community grievances � To ensure we 
receive and handle community grievances appropriatley, it is 
important we have a functioning operational grievance mechanism 
in place� We are pleased to see that our grievance mechanism is 
used, and will continue to revise and improve it to ensure local 
communities can alert us to issues as soon as they arise as outlined 
in our Human Rights Policy �

Community  
development 
activities
We prioritise working with customers, local author - 
ities, communities, and other actors in wind farm 
projects to develop strong relationships and 
invest in the local community� We always consider 
the results of the Social Due Diligence conducted 
for the project and our primary Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) when choosing com-
munity engagement initiatives� Some illustrative 
examples of these projects are included below�
of 14 students in the Lanshalia community � Materials to build a 
water storage reservoir were provided to support the basic water 
and sanitation needs of 16 women and 13 men of the Mushalerrain 
community � Solar panels were distributed to 16 families in the 
Lanshalia and Mushalerrain communities, contributing to livelihood 
improvements in terms of connectivity, communication, lighting, and 
food for families that had limited access to electricity � 
Additionally, to promote decent work, economic growth, and 
employability, we partnered with local universities and training 
centres � 26 women artisans participated in an ethnic handicraft 
workshop where they learned how to enhance their weaving 
techniques and entrepreneurial skills to begin their own businesses � 
33 local fishermen were trained in best practices and entrepreneur -
ship together with a partner university � 
Jordan 
In Jordan, we conducted community development activities linked to 
education and youth empowerment near our project � We engaged 
with local skills training centers for women to conduct a hydroponic 
farming and food processing training programme that benefited 45 
women in 4 communities near our project � Through the training, the 
beneficiaries learned farming methods for domestic use that can 
enhance their income either through domestic consumption or by 
starting their own business � 
India
In India, 42 women from the villages surrounding our Taralkatti wind 
farm in Karnataka state underwent tailoring and stitching training �

SENAI-RN � Our employees shared knowledge in several lectures 
over the three months duration of the course � Caiçara do Rio do 
Vento is a municipality with numerous wind farm projects under 
development, construction, and operation � 
Colombia
The inauguration of the La Guajira I wind farm in Colombia in 2022 
marked not only a new market entry for Vestas but also a leap for the 
energy transition in Colombia �
Our client's project is located in an area owned by Wayuu peoples, an 
ethnic group native to the Guajiran Peninsula � As we gained a better 
understanding of the local context and built a relationship with the 
affected communities, it was decided between the community 
members and Vestas to conduct community engagement initiatives 
during the construction phase focused on quality education (SDG 4), 
clean water and sanitation (SDG 6), affordable and clean energy 
(SDG 7), and decent work and economic growth (SDG 8) � 
Furniture and materials for a local Indigenous Rural Integral 
Ethno-educational institution were provided to improve the facilities

Establishing a strong compliance culture is not a 
destination but a journey� We continually focus on 
strengthening our policies, processes, training, 
and communication around business ethics to 
foster a culture of integrity� T o achieve this, 
setting the right tone at the top to demonstrate 
our management’s commitment to business 
ethics is crucial� 
Promoting a culture  
of integrity
Our approach to business conduct
Board of Directors: Audit Committee
Commitment to promoting business ethics is embedded at the 
highest level of the organisation: in the Audit Committee (AC) of  
the Vestas Board of Directors � The AC is responsible for monitoring, 
promoting, and assessing our culture of integrity � It evaluates the 
adequacy and effectiveness of our Anti-Bribery and Corruption 
(ABC) Compliance programmes and – if deficiencies are identified 
– ensures implementation of necessary actions to cover risks � The 
AC is also responsible for overseeing the Code of Conduct and 
Corporate Social Responsibility initiatives � 
Tone from the top: executive management and senior leadership 
The Executive Management team, Regional Management, and our 
people managers all seek to promote a culture of integrity through 
town halls and other meetings where they address topics within the 
Code of Conduct such as the trust in management and speak up 
culture � Furthermore, compliance is addressed in quarterly meetings 
between the Regional and Executive Management teams to ensure 
that our leadership oversees progress made by each region in the 
ABC Compliance programme and other related initiatives � On a 
yearly basis, Regional Management and Global Compliance meet 
and discuss initiatives based on the results of the Global ABC 
Survey� These meetings highlight each region’s key compliance risks 
and action points for the coming year and give management an 
active role in drafting the ABC Compliance programmes �
Global and regional compliance programmes
Our ABC Compliance programmes are built around our business 
ethics standards and establish how we map and prioritise activities 
that support a culture of integrity � Each programme describes  
how Global Compliance and Regional Legal & Compliance work  
with ABC Compliance in accordance with international anti-corrup -
tion legislation � 
The ABC programme comprises five pillars: Programme Governance; 
Learning & Awareness and Culture & Behaviour, which aim to prevent 
misconduct and promote a culture of integrity; and Monitoring & 
Auditing and EthicsLine, which detect and manage misconduct � 
In 2022, we ran the Global ABC Survey a second time � This anony -
mous survey asked all our office employees and service technicians 
about their perception of bribery and corruption risks � Among other 
questions, employees were also asked how comfortable they felt 
raising corruption concerns with their manager and to identify the 
top three compliance risks �
Approximately 49 percent of the invited employees replied and 
more than 3,000 written comments were received, creating enough 
data to identify trends and areas in need of support � The findings 
were shared with management and enabled regional action points 
to be included in global and regional compliance programmes to 
help mitigate the risks identified � We will continue to carry out the 
survey annually, enabling us to track trends over time �

Training and awareness
Training and communication activities are essential in fostering a 
culture of integrity globally, contributing to a common understand -
ing of what is expected from our employees � 
Since launching an updated Employee Code of Conduct in 2021, 
new mandatory micro-learnings have been released every quarter to 
refresh employees' knowledge on different topics in the Code � The 
micro-learnings range from 5- 12 minutes each, and include several 
interactive exercises inspired by past anonymised Vestas whistle -
blower cases �
We also provided several training sessions focused on different 
topics including Labour Rights and Modern Slavery, Conflicts of 
Interest, Gifts & Hospitality, and more, targeted to different 
functions and regions �
Speak Up campaign
In 2022, we began a global compliance campaign to promote our 
four principles for speaking up about compliance at Vestas: Hard 
decisions, Transparency, Integrity, and Consequences � To reach the 
whole organisation, the campaign included an interactive competi -
tion, intranet articles, info screens, and other regionalised initiatives 
at different Vestas locations � The campaign was promoted by senior 
leadership in town halls and team meetings and will continue 
throughout 2023 � 
Working ethically with suppliers
All Vestas suppliers are required to comply with our Supplier Code  
of Conduct � The Supplier Code is an integrated part of our purchase 
agreements, and if a supplier is not following the Code, we will take 
the necessary actions to mitigate risk and resolve any issues � 
In some cases, this includes triggering the Supplier Blocking Process 
to terminate our relationship with the supplier � Some of the other 
triggers for the Supplier Blocking Process include, but are not limited 
to, EthicsLine cases and safety non-compliance �

Leaders committed to a target for offshore wind of at least 65 GW 
by 2030 and 150 GW by 2050 in the North Sea, with Energy Islands 
and 20 GW of green hydrogen production capacity by 2030 �
Through our membership in over 100 renewable energy associa -
tions on a global, regional and national level, we help define  
policy recommendations and consultation responses on various 
legislative proposals � 
We support policies that aim to accelerate the energy transition  
and achieve the ambitions of the Paris Agreement � Our contribution 
to the establishment of policy recommendations and responses to 
public consultations by our associations focuses on:
• Increasing renewable energy build-out
• Scaling-up grid infrastructure and flexible solutions on supply  
and demand side
• Removing permitting and other bottlenecks that can impede  
the rapid scale-up of renewable energy
• Balancing the need for affordable electricity with healthy supply 
chains while incentivising broader system benefits in auction 
frameworks
• Strengthening renewable energy’s contribution to energy security
• Aligning electricity markets with the characteristics of variable 
renewable energy
• Removing bottlenecks for corporate renewable energy 
procurement
• Ensuring that legislation does not lock-in fossil fuel based solutions
• Setting a meaningful price on greenhouse gas emissions
• Promoting direct electrification through renewable electricity
• Laying the groundwork for indirect electrification to decarbonise 
hard-to-electrify sectors
• Passage of green recovery packages
• Incentivising circular economy principles for the recycling of wind 
turbine blades  
Major trade associations
1. Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC)
GWEC is an international trade association that represents the 
entire wind energy sector � GWEC works at the highest international 
political level to create a better policy environment for wind power � 
The association and its members are active all over the world, 
educating local and national governments and international 
agencies about the benefits of wind power �
2. WindEurope
WindEurope actively promotes wind energy across Europe and 
analyses, formulates, and establishes policy positions for the wind 
industry on key strategic sectoral issues, cooperating with industry 
and research institutions on a number of market development and 
technology research projects � Additionally, the lobbying activities 
undertaken by WindEurope help create a suitable legal framework 
for wind energy �
3. American Clean Power (ACP)
ACP promotes the acceleration of the clean energy transition in the 
US� It is the voice of companies from across the clean power sector 
that are powering America’s future and providing cost-effective 
solutions to the climate crisis while creating jobs, spurring massive 
investment in the US economy, and driving high-tech innovation 
across the nation �
We also use consultancies, law firms, and Danish Trade Council

Transparent and fair taxes are vital to our  
efforts to make a positive contribution to local 
communities and create a sustainable planet  
for future generations� 
We reinforce our commitments and mitigate both reputational and 
financial risks by continuously engaging in dialogue with stakeholders, 
including on tax transparency � Given our global footprint, we face 
scrutiny from tax authorities competing for the same tax revenue, 
which can result in tax audits, double taxation, arbitration, and law  - 
suits� We recognise that reporting initiatives cannot stand alone and 
focus on developing tools and governance mechanisms to limit the 
risk of double taxation � We also apply withholding taxes correctly 
and allocate income between Vestas companies in accordance with 
international regulations and standards � 
The Vestas Tax Policy 
As part of corporate governance, our Tax Policy is approved annually 
by the Board of Directors (Board) � In 2022, management made a 
recommendation to update the policy adding the new strategic area 
of Development � 
Supporting  
societies with 
sustainable  
tax practices
Sustainable tax We continue to base our approach to tax transparency on the Global 
Reporting Initiative (GRI) 207 standard, developed by the Global 
Sustainability Standards Board (GSSB) � Our Tax Policy is available on 
our corporate website and includes: 
• An overall commitment and approach to responsible tax practice 
• A governance structure, where our tax policy is subject to annual 
review and approval by the Board
• An explicit policy on tax planning, disputes, and risk management 
In 2022 we continued mapping our tax contribution based on our 
geographical footprint � Through this process, we have ensured 
traceability between financial disclosures, disclosures to tax 
authorities, and our tax contribution report � We have based our 
reporting on actual tax payments, external revenue, and number of 
employees to provide an objective and transparent measure � 
 For consistency in our reporting, we have regionalised geographical 
segmentation based on our financial disclosure � For an overview of 
our key tax ratios and country specific payments, see page 79-80 � 
Our aim is to demonstrate how we applied our tax principles and 
provide more information about our tax footprint � We reconcile the 
information in the Total Tax Contribution report with the Effective 
Tax Rate (ETR) of the consolidated group as an additional step in our 
policy of tax transparency �
The global tax environment 
With a global supply chain, manufacturing facilities, and wind 
turbines installed in more than 86 countries, we are impacted by 
developments in the international tax arena � We therefore support 
the harmonisation of international tax rules and collaboration 
between governments to ensure a fair tax environment � 
When it comes to tax disputes, we seek to minimise any cash flow 
impact and engage in an open dialogue with tax authorities � This 
process is often conducted on a bilateral basis, bringing all relevant 
parties to the table to reach a swift and fair settlement � Sometimes, 
such disputes can extend beyond ten years and consume significant 
resources � As a company, we pursue the interests of our sharehold -
ers and will defend our position where we consider this the most 
reasonable course of action � 
Like any other business, we take local tax policies into account when 
making business decisions, but we do not take operational decisions 
based on tax optimisation � We act in a responsible way with deep 
respect of all tax jurisdictions where we are located � Acknowledging 
the global supply chain and operations which characterise our 
industry, we advocate for a level playing field for all businesses in  
the industry � 
We also welcome the involvement of industry organisations and 
political stakeholders to ensure the state of our industry is known to 
decision-makers, and to promote the transition to renewable energy 
through improved framework conditions � We seek to mitigate, to the 
extent possible, significant tax risks by reaching agreements with

We have applied three categories of taxes that appropriately 
communicates how our tax footprint is linked to the business 
model 
• Income taxes: T axes paid and accrued in relation to our 
profit generation
• Employee taxes: T axes paid and expensed (borne) or with-
held (collected) in relation to our people
• Indirect taxes: T axes generated through transactions 
across the supply chain and either expensed as operation 
cost (borne) or received (collected)

Sustainability-linked loan (SLL) 
In 2021, we signed up to a EUR 2,000m revolving multi-currency 
credit facility with a group of leading banks � The facility’s margin is 
closely linked to our sustainability KPIs and will support our 
ambitions to accelerate the deployment of renewable energy and 
drive technological innovation � 
Directly linked with our sustainability strategy, the facility’s interest 
rate margin will be adjusted based on sustainability-linked perfor -
mance targets – the first time we have engaged with sustainabili -
ty-linked financing � These targets measure our ability to reduce our 
carbon footprint and enhance workplace safety, while adding 
ambitious targets to drive improvements across our supply chain � 
Performance targets will also cover ambitions to increase both the 
use of sustainable materials and recyclability across the turbine 
value chain � 
The facility will be key to supporting our efforts to drive deployment, 
evolve new technology and increase sustainability performance 
across our value chain � 
Sustainability-linked bonds (SLB)
To firmly link progress on our sustainability targets with our financial 
performance, we became the first Danish company to issue 
sustainability-linked bonds � Announced in March, the two EUR 
500m sustainability-linked bonds, with a duration of 7 and 12 years, 
generated wide interest and were oversubscribed 3 �3 times�
The bonds' fixed rate is directly linked to our sustainability perfor -
mance and will be adjusted based on yearly defined sustainability 
targets in the following areas: 
•  Reducing the carbon footprint of our own operations  
(scope 1 and 2) 
•  Reducing carbon emissions in our supply chain (scope 3) 
•  Increasing material efficiency in our own operations 
The full sustainability-linked bond framework agreement, including 
yearly defined targets on these KPIs, is publicly available on our 
corporate website, along with progress reports on the bonds issued 
annually� The bonds diversify our funding base and are listed on the 
regulated market Euronext Dublin � By linking our sustainability 
performance with interest rate margins, we reinforce our commit -
ment to realising our ambitious sustainability targets, and collabo -
rate with our financial partners to gain access to favourable interest 
rates as an incentive for doing so �

SASB disclosure
1   Contract employees are defined by SASB’s Wind 
Technology Project Developer’s Standard 2018 “as those 
who are not on the entity’s payroll, but who are 
supervised by the entity on a day-to-day basis, including 
independent contractors and those employed by third 
parties (e.g., temp agencies and labor brokers).”
2  Sound emissions can be significantly lower during normal 
operation, since the given range consists of the maximum 
sound power levels of the different turbine models 
installed in the year. We also offer a number of 
noise- reduced operational modes where lower sound 
emissions are required.
3  Wind class data based is based on design wind class and 
does not correlate to delivered figures per wind-class.

Notes to Sustainability key figures
Recyclability rate of hub and blade (%)
Recyclability rate of hub and blade is calculated as the 
recyclable share of the total rotor (i.e. hub and blade) mass. 
The measure is based on the material composition of all 
turbine types that were produced and shipped in the reporting 
year. Recyclability rates of different materials and component 
types are quantified and estimated based on information from 
life cycle assessment (LCA) reports. 
Material efficiency (tonnes of waste excl. recycled materials 
per MW produced and shipped)
Material efficiency is defined as the total tonnes of non-
recycled waste materials from Vestas’ own manufacturing 
per MW capacity produced and shipped during the reporting 
period. Non-recycled waste materials include those that are 
incinerated or landfilled.
CO2e emissions  
Carbon emissions are measured using the carbon dioxide 
equivalent (CO2e) to include all relevant greenhouse gasses 
according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. A distinction is 
made between scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions, as also defined by 
the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. 
Direct emissions of CO2e (scope 1) (1,000 t) 
Scope 1: Direct emissions of CO2e are calculated based on 
determined amounts of fuel for own transport and the direct 
consumption of fossil-based fuels (e.g., oil and gas), with the 
usage of standard factors published by the UK Department for 
Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS) (2022). 
Indirect emissions of CO2e (scope 2) (1,000 t) 
Scope 2: Covers emissions released in connection with the 
consumption of purchased electricity and heat. Indirect 
market-based emissions of CO2e from consumption of 
electricity are calculated using national grid emission factors 
published by the International Energy Agency (2022). Indirect 
CO2e emissions from district heating are calculated using BEIS 
(2022) emission factors. 
Environmental 
Vestas' environmental key figures encompass the Vestas 
Group in an operational control perspective (including owned 
and leased entities) ensuring a comprehensive and accurate 
statement of these figures. This approach applies to all 
environmental indicators that are reported for the accounting 
period, based on data registered locally in the Vestas reporting 
system, consolidated on Group level.
Utilisation of resources
Consumption of energy (GWh)
This indicator includes electricity, gas, oil, biomass, LPG,  
diesel, gasoline, marine gas oil and district heating. Energy  
is reported based on quantities consumed, including cars 
owned and leased by Vestas, employee benefit cars, and fuel 
for transportation on project sites, production equipment,  
and machinery. Consumption of electricity comprises 
electricity purchased externally. Oil for heating is based on 
external purchases and met re readings at the end of the 
reporting period.
Renewable energy (%)
Electricity from renewable energy sources is calculated on  
the basis of supplier statements. 
Renewable electricity for own activities (%)
Electricity from renewable energy sources is calculated on the 
basis of supplier statements. Only 100 percent renewable 
electricity is counted as renewable electricity. 
Withdrawal of fresh water (1,000 m3)
The withdrawal of water is measured by withdrawal of fresh 
water based on supplier statements and metre readings. 
Waste
Volume of waste from own operations (1,000 tonnes) and - 
of which collected for recycling (1,000 tonnes)
Volume of waste is based on weight. Waste disposal method  
is based on supplier statements.
Basis for preparation 
of the statement
General reporting approach
The below description of accounting policies refers to the 
environmental, social, and governance indicators presented 
on page 76.
All Vestas’ wholly owned companies are covered by the 
report. Newly established companies are included from the 
time of production start, and companies are excluded from 
the reporting from the specific time when they leave Vestas’ 
control. Acquired companies are included from the specific 
time when coming under Vestas’ control. 
Defining materiality
Vestas performs its materiality assessment based on an 
analysis of significant economic, environmental and social 
impacts of the company’s activities. The analysis is based 
on internal priorities as well as experience from dialogue 
with and direct involvement of customers, investors, policy 
makers, employees, and media. The result of the analysis is 
incorporated in the Vestas Sustainability Report, which is 
published on an annual basis.
Indirect emissions of CO2e from the supply chain (scope 3) 
(million t) 
Scope 3: Indirect emissions of CO2e from the value chain are 
reported based on the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. Scope 3 
categories 8, 9, 10, 11, 13 and 15 are immaterial for Vestas 
and category 14 is not applicable.
Wind plant: The largest part of the emissions is in category 
1 ‘Purchased goods and services’ , emissions from materials 
going into products are calculated based on LCAs following 
ISO 14040 & 14044, publicly available at vestas.com. 
The CO2e emissions of different materials and component 
types are based on the total quantity of annual produced 
and shipped turbines and the material composition of the 
individual turbine types as stated in the LCA reports. Based 
on this, the global material mass balance is calculated for 
all materials consumed during the production and CO2e 
emissions are calculated using GaBi (2022) emission factors 
per material group for raw materials used in production 
and manufacturing processes. The actual steel mass for all 
produced and shipped turbines is used to calculate global 
CO2e emissions for the raw material production of steel and for 
foundation materials. The CO2e emissions from concrete and 
steel used in foundations is based on the same LCA reports as 
the remaining material groups.
Construction: The CO2e emissions emitted during the 
construction of a wind farm is estimated based on the quantity 
of diesel-fuel consumed per wind turbine produced and 
shipped in markets in which Vestas is responsible for installing 
the wind turbine. LCA studies for the diesel combustion per 
turbine installation and respective BEIS emission factors 
(2022) are applied. 
Service: CO2e emissions from service operations are estimated 
using the quantity of spare parts that are replaced and 
repaired in the reporting year, as well as expected repair and 
replacement levels. GaBi (2022) emission factors for the raw 
materials are applied to estimate global CO2e emissions.
Capital goods: Other purchased goods and services and 
capital goods (category 2) and waste generated in operations 
(category 5) are estimated based on spend data using BEIS

working hours, including externally employed workers under 
Vestas' supervision. 
Lost Time Injuries per million working hours (number) 
Lost Time Injuries are injuries that have caused at least one 
workday of absence after the day of the injury per one million 
working hours. The Lost Time Injury Rate (L TIR) represents 
all Lost Time injuries reported per one million working hours. 
The number of working hours and external supervised workers 
are registered and measured on the same basis as the T otal 
Recordable Injuries. The L TIR includes fatalities. 
The number of working hours is measured on the basis of 
hours registered in the system for hourly-paid employees, and 
prescribed working hours for salaried employees excluding e.g. 
holidays, absence due to illness and maternity leave.
Employees
Average number of employees (FTEs)
The average number of employees is calculated as the twelve-
month average number of full-time equivalents (FTEs). The 
employees included are under Vestas’ financial control (i.e. 
have standard and temporary contracts directly with Vestas). 
Employees at the end of the period (FTEs) 
Employees at the end of the period are calculated based on 
total full-time equivalents (FTE). The employees included 
are under Vestas’ financial control (i.e. have standard and 
temporary contracts directly with Vestas).   
Diversity and inclusion
The share of women in the Board, the Executive management 
team and leadership positions are calculated based on 
headcounts at the end of the reporting period. Headcount 
is based on number of individuals employed , irrespective of 
contract (full-time/part-time).   
Women in the Board and Executive Management team at the 
end of the period (%)
Women in the Board and Executive Management team  
is the share of women among the members of the Board  
who are elected by the Annual General Meeting and the share 
performance data from the wind turbine types produced and 
shipped in the reporting year. Vestas applies an expected 
lifetime based on site-specific agreed lifetimes where this 
differs from the standard design lifetime. The avoided CO2e  
is based on the latest updated standard factor of global 
average carbon emissions for electricity from the International 
Energy Agency (2022).
Annual CO2e avoided by the total aggregated installed fleet 
(million tonnes)
Annual CO2e avoided by the total aggregated installed fleet is 
calculated based on total annual installed capacity and global 
average CO2e emissions avoided in one year of operation. 
Vestas applies a fleet average capacity factor in 2022. The 
avoided CO2e is based on the latest updated standard factor 
of global average carbon emissions for electricity from the 
International Energy Agency (2022).
Social 
Safety
T otal Recordable Injuries (number)
The total recordable injuries (TRI) include fatalities, lost  
time incidents, restricted work injuries and medical  
treatment injuries. 
TRI includes injuries for employees and externally employed 
workers under Vestas' supervision. Supervision of an external 
worker is day-to-day working directions.  
‘Of which Lost Time injuries’: The lost time injuries are based on 
incidents reported in Vestas' reporting system, with more than 
one day of absence from work, including externally employed 
workers under Vestas' supervision. 
‘Of which fatal injuries’: The fatal injuries are based on 
incidents reported in Vestas’ reporting system, including 
externally employed workers under Vestas’ supervision.
T otal Recordable Injuries per million working hours (number) 
T otal Recordable Injury Rate (TRIR) represents all injuries 
reported in the Vestas reporting system per one million 
factors for Indirect emissions from the supply chain (2011). 
Fuel- and energy-related activities are calculated using BEIS 
factors for emissions related to the production of fuel and 
NREL factors for renewable energy. 
Transportation: Emissions from upstream transportation 
(category 4) are based on supplier information and estimated 
based on the LCA reports for weight and distance of 
components transported and BEIS (2022) carbon emissions 
factors. Business travel (category 6) emissions for air flights 
are activity-based data provided by the travel agency used for 
all bookings. Employee commuting (category 7) is reported on 
daily commute by car, which is estimated based on the average 
number of FTEs and a selected sample of commuting distance. 
It applies standard factors published by the BEIS (2022). 
End-of-life treatment: Of sold products (category 12) is 
estimated based on material composition of all produced and 
shipped wind turbines in the reporting year. For materials that 
are not recyclable, an average GaBi (2022) emission factor for 
inert landfill is applied. 
Indirect emissions of CO2e from the supply chain (scope 3) 
(kg CO2e per MWh generated) 
The amount of MWh generated is based on the number and 
type of wind turbines produced and shipped in the financial 
year along with values for wind turbine capacity factor and 
site-specific lifetime. In relation to the target to reduce carbon 
emissions in the value chain, indirect emissions of CO2e from 
the value chain per MWh generated include 70 percent of the 
scope 3 emissions.
Products
CO2e avoided is to be understood as the volume of emissions 
avoided by using the wind turbines as an electricity source, 
compared to the latest updated IEA World average level of 
CO2e impact involved in electricity generation. 
Expected CO2e avoided over the lifetime of the capacity 
produced and shipped during the period (million tonnes)
This is based on total wind turbines (MW) produced and 
shipped during the reporting period. A weighted average 
capacity factor was applied in 2022, based on actual hourly 
of women among the members of the Executive  
Management combined.
 Women in leadership positions at the end of the period (%)
The share of women in leadership positions is calculated 
based on headcounts at the end of the reporting period. The 
parameter is calculated based on the number of women in 
leadership positions divided by the total number of leadership 
positions. Employee information is from the company’s 
ordinary registration systems with specification of gender and 
management level. Leadership positions comprise managers, 
specialists, project managers, and above.
Human rights
Community grievances (number)
The number of community grievances is calculated based 
on incidents registered in the reporting system. The 
measure “Community grievances” covers the total number of 
community complaints registered in the reporting system in 
the reporting year. Vestas registers and handles community 
incidents caused by Vestas or its contractors on communities 
that turn into a grievance, where a “community” is a person or 
group that is either directly or indirectly affected by Vestas or 
Vestas' activities. The cases occur in connection with a wind 
farm project and its associated facilities (e.g. accommodation 
facilities), a Vestas factory or a Vestas Research and 
Development Centre.
Community beneficiaries (number)
Community beneficiaries are defined as individuals that have 
benefitted by participating in Vestas’ community development 
initiatives intended to upgrade skills or by receiving financial 
or equivalent aid. 
These initiatives are implemented during the reporting period 
in connection to a wind farm project and associated facilities, a 
Vestas factory, or Vestas Research and Development Centre. 
Community development initiatives are identified in 
collaboration with local stakeholders, such as local authorities 
and members of the local community to ensure that the 
initiatives meet local needs.

In brief General GovernanceEnvironment Social Appendix
This indicator only includes defined community members 
that benefit directly. It does not include Vestas employees 
or community members in cases where the number of 
beneficiaries is undefined e.g. installation of solar cells on 
a village health clinic. Where the beneficiary is a household, 
Vestas calculates the total beneficiaries based on the average 
number of individuals per household defined by the UN 
Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN 2017).
Social Due Diligence on projects in scope (%)
This measures the share of wind power projects, materialised 
as firm orders, that have been subject to social due diligence 
(SDD) processes in the reporting period. Wind farm projects 
in scope for SDD are: 1) Engineering, Procurement and 
Construction (EPC) projects in emerging markets; 2) all 
Supply-and-installation projects of 100 MW or above in 
emerging markets; and 3) projects in OECD countries with 
a risk rating of ‘Extreme’ or ‘High’ according to the Verisk 
Maplecroft’s “Indigenous People” risk index on risks related 
to indigenous people’s lands, territories or livelihoods under 
threat. In this context, ‘Emerging markets’ are defined as 
non-OECD, high-income countries, as defined by the World 
Bank classifications. SDD procedures include: 1) a high-level 
country assessment; 2) ‘Know Y our Customer’ assessment; and 
3) an in-depth project assessment on social matters.
Governance
Whistle-blower system
EthicsLine cases (number)
All whistleblower cases reported to the EthicsLine 
whistleblower hotline are investigated by the EthicsLine 
function supported by the relevant Ethics Committee, with  
the purpose of identifying whether a violation of the Code  
of Conduct has taken place.
Of which substantiated (number) or unsubstantiated (number): 
Upon the completion of the investigation, cases are classified 
as either substantiated or unsubstantiated. At the end of 
the reporting year, the variance between the total number of 
reported cases and the combined total of substantiated and 
unsubstantiated cases are calculated to identify the number 
of open cases still under investigation. These are expected to 
be assessed during the following reporting year, and included 
in the number of substantiated or unsubstantiated cases in 
the reporting year when the case is closed.

EU T axonomy reporting 
The EU T axonomy for sustainable activities (the “T axonomy”) 
is a classification system of economic activities that are 
determined by the EU to make a substantial contribution to 
environmental sustainability. 
Under Article 8(1) of the T axonomy regulation (EU) 
2020/852, companies required to publish non-financial 
information pursuant to the Non-Financial Reporting 
Directive (NFRD) shall disclose information to the public on 
how and to what extent their activities are associated with 
environmentally sustainable economic activities.
For reporting year 2022, companies are required to 
report on 1) the eligibility of their economic activities, 
2) the environmental objective(s) their eligible activities 
substantially contribute to and 3) the alignment of their 
eligible activities with the applicable Do No Significant Harm 
(“DNSH”) criteria and the Minimum Safeguards in line with 
Article 3 of EU/2020/852. 
By screening our business activities, we have identified 
our manufacturing activities as eligible under Activity 3.1: 
Manufacture of renewable energy technologies, and our 
construction, service, and development activities as eligible 
under Activity 7.6: Installation, maintenance, and repair of 
renewable energy technologies.
Our manufacturing activities substantially contribute to 
climate change mitigation by manufacturing renewable  
energy technologies, and our construction, service and 
development activities substantially contribute to climate 
change mitigation by installing, maintaining, or repairing  
wind turbines. 
T o align with the DNSH criteria and comply with the Minimum 
Safeguards, we have ensured compliance to these criteria  
for each eligible business activity.
All DNSH criteria are applicable to Activity 3.1 while only 
DNSH 1: Climate Change Adaptation is applicable to  
Activity 7.6.
T axonomy alignment
DNSH 1: Climate Change Adaptation 
We ensure that we have screened our economic activities 
and critical suppliers against the physical climate risks listed 
in Section II of Appendix A to the T axonomy. The materiality 
of the significant risks identified has been assessed, and 
adequate adaptation solutions have been implemented. 
DNSH 2: Sustainable Use and Protection of Water and 
Marine Resources
We ensure that an Environmental Impact Assessment (“EIA ”) 
in accordance with Directive 2011/92/EU of the European 
Parliament and of the Council including an assessment of the 
impact on water in accordance with Directive 2000/60/EC, or 
equivalent, has been carried out for all manufacturing facilities 
in the EU. For facilities in countries outside the EU, we have 
ensured the presence of EIAs and water permits equivalent to 
the standards of the EU.
DNSH 3: Transition to Circular Economy 
We ensure that our manufacturing activities assess the 
availability of, and where possible, adopt techniques that 
support the requirements under the three sub-criteria: Reuse, 
Design, and Waste Management. T o comply with the sub-
criteria Traceability of Substances, we have implemented a 
third-party software to track substances of concern, which will 
enable us to trace the materials used to manufacture products 
throughout their lifecycle.
DNSH 4: Pollution Prevention and Control 
We ensure that our Prohibited and Restricted Substance 
Management document, used to regulate restricted and 
prohibited chemicals at all business levels and units at 
Vestas, meets the standards necessary under the five 
sub-criteria: Persistent Organic Pollution, Mercury, Ozone 
Depleting substances, Substances in Electrical and Electronic 
Equipment, and certain dangerous substances. 
DNSH 5: Protection and Restoration of Biodiversity  
and Ecosystems
We ensure that an EIA or screening has been performed in 
accordance with Directive 2011/92/EU for all necessary 
facilities in the EU, and that the required mitigation and 
compensation measures for protecting the environment 
are implemented where necessary. For facilities in countries 
outside the EU, we have ensured the presence of EIAs and 
water permits equivalent to the standards of the EU.
Minimum Safeguards
Our Social Management System and Social Due Diligence 
approach is developed based on the United Nations Guiding 
Principles on Business and Human Rights (“UNGPs”) and 
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development 
(“OECD”) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. They 
contain all the necessary requirements to be considered as 
adequate process for human rights due diligence as per Article 
18 of the Delegated Act.
We are compliant with the sub-criteria T axation through  
our T ax Policy, which covers all decisions that directly or 
indirectly affect reporting and/or payment of taxes under 
the liability of any Vestas Group Company, and our T ax Risk 
Management reporting. 
Our Global Anti-Bribery and Corruption Programme consists 
of five pillars: programme governance, learning & awareness, 
culture & behaviour, monitoring & auditing, and EthicsLine. 
Our annual Global Anti-Bribery and Corruption Survey is 
taken by Vestas employees globally and ensures that we have 
adequate anti-corruption processes in place in compliance 
with Article 18 of the Delegated Act.
Our Employee Code of Conduct and Supplier Code of Conduct 
each include a section on fair competition, which includes  
clear expectations on how our employees and suppliers  
should adhere to all applicable competition laws. We have  
also developed a detailed Competition Law Guideline and 
launched a mandatory e-learning on Competition Law for our 
office employees.
We have not registered any final court convictions violating 
labour law and human rights, tax laws, corruption laws, or 
fair competition laws against the Vestas Group or senior 
management, and we have implemented a new approach  
to tracking court convictions, ensuring compliance with  
the T axonomy.
T axonomy-aligned revenue
96 percent of our revenue is aligned for 2022. 71 percent of 
the aligned revenue is related to our manufacturing activities, 
and 25 percent of the aligned revenue is related to our 
construction and service activities.
For T axonomy reporting, the revenue derived from 1) Supply-
only, 2) Supply-and-installation, 3) Engineering, Procurement 
and Construction (“EPC”), and 4) Service contracts (excluding 
Sale of spare parts) is split under Activity 3.1 and Activity 7.6. 
The supply portion of contracts is included under Activity 3.1, 
and the installation portion and other activities included in the 
contracts are included under Activity 7.6.
Revenue not T axonomy-aligned
4 percent of our revenue is eligible but not aligned for 2022. 
Based on our assessment, we cannot conclude that activities 
related to the Development business or Sale of spare parts 
are aligned. These activities are currently considered eligible 
under Activity 7.6. Alignment of these activities is planned 
for 2023.
 Accounting principles - revenue
Vestas recognises revenue in compliance with IFRS 15, split 
into two segments: Power Solutions and Service.
The Power Solutions segment comprises revenue relating to 
Supply-only, Supply-and-installation, and EPC (Engineering, 
Procurement and Construction) contracts. Revenue from the 
Development business is reported under Supply-only in the 
Power Solutions segment. The Service segment comprises 
revenue relating to contracts for servicing wind turbines 
87
Vestas Sustainability Report 2022
Appendix
Vestas Sustainability Report 2022

In brief General GovernanceEnvironment Sustainability dataSocial
manufactured by Vestas and wind turbines manufactured by 
third parties. Revenue generated from the sale of spare parts 
is reported under ‘products and services transferred at a point 
in time’ in the Service segment. More details on key accounting 
estimates, judgements, and accounting policies for revenue 
are available in the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 
1.2, page 83 in the Annual Report. 
For T axonomy reporting, we separated revenue resulting from 
supply in both 1) Supply-and-installation and 2) EPC projects. 
Supply-and-installation and EPC projects are bundled 
performance obligations as per IFRS 15.29, but in this case 
were separated to report revenue under the correct economic 
activity of the T axonomy. The revenue from the Development 
business is presented under Activity 3.1 bundled together 
with Supply-only, which is in line with the presentation in Note 
1.2, page 85 in the Annual Report.
The revenue is separated based on a ratio derived from the 
pricing of revenue in each contract type. The denominator 
includes all revenue derived from both our segments: Power 
Solutions and Service, net of taxes and rebates, as defined 
under article 2 point (5) of directive 2013/34/EU. The 
numerator includes all revenue except that which results from 
the Development business and Sale of spare parts as these 
activities are not aligned for 2022.
T o avoid double counting, we excluded non-aligned revenue 
from the total revenue when calculating the percentage of 
aligned revenue.
T axonomy-aligned OPEX
94 percent of our operating expenditure (OPEX) is aligned  
for 2022. 23 percent of the aligned OPEX is related to  
Activity 3.1, and 71 percent of the aligned OPEX is related  
to Activity 7.6. 
The aligned OPEX consists of expenditures relating to short 
term leases, research and development costs not capitalised 
during the year, building renovation measures and other direct 
expenditures linked to service and operation of assets related 
to manufacturing, construction, and service.
OPEX not T axonomy-aligned
1 percent of our OPEX is eligible but not aligned as it relates to 
the Development business and Sale of spare parts. 
The remaining 5 percent of our OPEX is non-eligible as it is 
related to supporting administrative functions not directly 
linked to our eligible business activities.
 Accounting principles - OPEX
Our OPEX comprises 1) research and development costs 
not capitalised during the year, and 2) distribution costs and 
administration costs as specified in Note 1.3 on page 86 in 
the Annual Report.
The definition of OPEX in the T axonomy is different from the 
one used at Vestas. Following the definition of OPEX in Article 
8(2) of the Delegated Act, we have included all expenditures 
relating to short term leases, repair and maintenance, research 
and development not capitalised during the year, building 
renovation measures and other direct expenditures relating to 
servicing and operation of assets in our calculation of OPEX.
The denominator includes OPEX relating to eligible as well as 
non-eligible activities. The numerator includes OPEX directly 
linked to aligned business activities and therefore excludes 
any OPEX related to the Development business, Sale of spare 
parts, and support functions.
Selected accounts that match the T axonomy definition 
of OPEX have been classified based on specific business 
activities and summed up to calculate the numerator and the 
denominator. Each account is added to the sum only once to 
avoid double counting.
In 2022, the method to calculate eligible OPEX was changed. 
In 2021, OPEX comprised all production cost, research and 
development cost, distribution cost and special items and 
administration cost, excluding depreciation. In 2022, most 
production costs are not eligible as OPEX as per the definition 
of OPEX in Article 8(2) of the Delegated Act. The eligible 
OPEX for 2022 is based on selected accounts in production, 
research and development, and distribution cost.
T axonomy-aligned CAPEX
91 percent of our capital expenditure (CAPEX) is aligned 
for 2022. All CAPEX relating to assets in manufacturing, 
technology, sales, and service is aligned. 72 percent of the 
aligned CAPEX is related to Activity 3.1 and 19 percent of the 
aligned CAPEX is related Activity 7.6.
CAPEX not T axonomy-aligned
7 percent of our CAPEX is eligible but not aligned as it stems 
from the Development business and Sale of spare parts. 
The remaining 2 percent of our CAPEX is non-eligible as it is 
related to supporting administrative functions not directly 
linked to our eligible business activities.
 Accounting principles - CAPEX
Vestas has fixed assets presented as Intangible assets 
and Property, Plant and Equipment in the Balance Sheet as 
specified on page 75 in the Annual Report. Any additions to 
these asset categories are considered as CAPEX. Refer to 
accounting policies in the Consolidated Financial Statements, 
Notes 3.1 on page 96 of the Annual Report for intangible 
assets and 3.2 on page 98 of the Annual Report for property, 
plant, and equipment.
For T axonomy reporting, the assets considered as CAPEX 
are: software, other intangible assets, development projects 
in progress, land and buildings, plant and machinery, other 
fixtures and fittings, tools and equipment in progress and 
right-of-use assets. Both cash and non-cash additions to 
these assets are considered as CAPEX. The denominator 
includes all CAPEX for the assets mentioned above. The 
numerator includes CAPEX directly linked to aligned business 
activities and therefore excludes any CAPEX related to the 
Development business, Sale of spare parts, and assets owned 
by support functions.
T o avoid double counting, we have calculated the percentage 
of aligned CAPEX by excluding non-aligned CAPEX from total 
CAPEX for all asset classes.

than investing in fossil fuels as renewables are more labour 
intensive and are quicker to build than thermal power 
plants� Per USD 10 million investment, renewable energy 
creates 75 jobs (direct and indirect), as compared to 27 
from fossil fuels�1  
• In 2022, we invested EUR X m in R&D related to the further 
scale-up of clean energy�
UN T arget (Indicator)

occupation, age and persons with disabilities)
Our contributions
• Aside from a competitive salary, working for Vestas comes 
hand-in-hand with a range of other benefits (depending 
on the local market conditions): pension, insurance plans, 
health insurance, subsidised lunch, gym access and work/
life policies� Our compensation packages are benchmarked 
against local market salaries for each position – to ensure 
equal and fair pay regardless of social identity�
UN T arget (Indicator)
8�7:    T ake immediate and effective measures to eradi-
cate forced labour, end modern slavery and human

child labour, by sex and age) 
Our contributions
• For the past decade, we have been working to develop  
and promote a unique approach to respecting human 
rights� In our Human Rights Policy, we recognise our respon-
sibility to respect human rights as set out in the United  
Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and accord-
ing to the framework outlined in the UN Guiding Principles 
on Business and Human Rights� Our Supplier Code of Con-
duct outlines this expectation to all our stakeholders, and 
we publicly endorse and advocate for mandatory human 
rights due diligence� Through our Social Due Diligence Pro-
cess and supplier screening, we work to end forced labour, 
modern slavery and child labour as part of our ambition  
to be the most socially responsible company in the  
energy industry� 
UN T arget (Indicator)
