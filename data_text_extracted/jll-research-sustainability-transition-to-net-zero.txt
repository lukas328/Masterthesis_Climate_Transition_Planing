3 | Transition to net-zero
With real estate and associated infrastructure responsible 
for close to 40% of global carbon emissions, and with 
the net-zero market transformation truly underway, I am 
proud that JLL is leading the way with our wide-ranging 
commitments to sustainability.  
 
We have been working with the Science Based Targets 
initiative (SBTi) to help create Version 1.0 of the Net-Zero 
Standard, a new framework for net-zero target setting. 
Without a common science-based definition of what 
constitutes a “net-zero” target, companies and their 
stakeholders can’t be sure that their long-term climate targets 
are credible or ambitious enough. The Net-Zero Standard 
includes target validation criteria as well as user-friendly 
guidance for setting net-zero targets. 
During this consultation, we applied the methodology of the 
new Net-Zero Standard, and I am proud the SBTi has certified 
our commitment to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions 
across our value chain by 2040.
By committing to cut 95% of our carbon footprint by 2040, we 
are going beyond the requirement of climate science, which 
demands a 90% reduction by 2050. We accept that there will 
be some residual emissions in 2040. These are allowed for in 
our 5% offset calculations. 
Our first task has been to collect and refine our emissions 
data; improving data accuracy remains our priority. Absolute 
emission reduction pathways are being calculated across 
all categories in all three scopes to enable us to measure 
progress against five-yearly milestones. 
But it is not just about making commitments and creating 
pathways. There is urgent need for action if we are to secure  
a 51% reduction by 2030. Our figures in 2021 will give us a 
better idea of the challenges ahead, but the 19% reduction in 
our Scopes 1 and 2 emissions in 2020 from our 2018 baseline 
is a promising start. 
Looking ahead, our greatest challenge is our Scope 3 
emissions: 96% of our footprint is made up from the 
properties we manage on behalf of our clients. It is therefore 
essential that we collaborate with our clients on securing 
accurate data and motivate them to implement their own 
mitigation pathways.
Please read more about our commitment  
to achieving net-zero and engage with us as  
we do the hard work to make this a reality.

A better world is a  
net-zero world 
JLL commits to reduce 
absolute scope 1, 2 and 
3 emissions by 51% by 
2030, and 95% by 2040, 
from a 2018 base year
A ‘code red for humanity’ , issued by the United Nations 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in The Sixth  
Assessment Report, is a call on businesses to reduce 
their carbon emissions immediately.  
 
JLL has been on a sustainability journey for 15 years, 
delivering services to help clients with their sustainability 
agenda. We made our first global commitment to address 
our carbon footprint in 2011.  
 
In 2018, as part of our purpose to shape the future of real 
estate for a better world, the firm set a science-based target 
to cut our Scopes 1 and 2 emissions by 68% by 2034 and to 
cut Scope 3 emissions by 53% over the same period. This 
target was aligned to the emissions pathway needed to keep 
the global temperature rise below 1.5°C. It was formally 
approved by the SBTi in 2020.   
In 2020, JLL also signed the World Green Building Council  
Net-Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment, pledging to  
only occupy offices which are net-zero carbon in operation  
by 2030. 
 
Recognizing that bold and ambitious actions are required, 
in May 2021 JLL set a target to achieve net-zero emissions 
by 2040, encompassing our entire Greenhouse Gas (GHG) 
inventory. In a related move, JLL also signed The Climate 
Pledge in May 2021, committing JLL to being net-zero by 
2040, ten years ahead of the Paris Agreement.  
On October 28, 2021, JLL’s net-zero 2040 target was certified 
by the SBTi to its new Net-Zero Standard. We are among a 
select group of global companies across all sectors to be 
recognized for aligning their net-zero commitments with 
climate science.

The Science Based Targets initiative has formally 
approved JLL ’s net-zero 2040 target as certified  
to Net-Zero Standard.  
 
JLL commits to making an absolute reduction in its total 
footprint of 51% by 2030 and 95% by 2040. Our net-zero 
target covers our entire GHG inventory. Those buildings JLL 
manages on behalf of clients (reported under “use of sold 
products”) are JLL’s most significant source of emissions,  
and account for 96% of JLL’s total emissions footprint.   
To achieve the required reductions to meet this target,  
JLL will be working closely with our clients to support them 
in delivering their own ambitious climate goals, helping 
to develop and action sustainability strategies, improving 
the energy efficiency of their portfolios, and making use of 
renewable energy wherever possible.  
Our strategy is predicated on reducing almost our entire 
baseline emissions; only then will JLL offset residual 
emissions. We have committed to offset no more than  
5% of our 2018 baseline. 
JLL will report company-wide emissions and progress 
against our targets on an at least annual basis via JLL’s Global 
Sustainability Report and other public communications 
available from our website.

Standard Organization

Scope 2

Scope 3 
Emissions from  
value chain
As the urgency around the climate 
emergency increases, more and  
more organisations are setting  
net-zero emissions targets. These 
targets cover a range of different 
scopes, timelines and pathways  
and are often not underpinned by 
current climate science.  
Recognising the need for a consistent 
and objective approach to net-zero 
targets, the SBTi began developing 
a new framework in 2021 to 
provide business leaders with a 
common, robust, and science-based 
understanding of what net-zero means 
in practice. After inviting experts - 
including JLL - to form the SBTi Net-
Zero Expert Advisory Group, the SBTi 
formulated the Net-Zero Standard.  
The Net-Zero Standard brings the 
latest climate science to net-zero target 
setting. It is the first global science-
based standard to guide organisations 
setting net-zero targets and encourage 
them to follow the principles of the 
mitigation hierarchy. Effectively this 
means that companies should set 
science-based targets to reduce their 
value chain emissions and implement 
strategies to achieve these targets 
before engaging in neutralisation. 
 
The SBTi defines beyond value chain 
mitigation as action or investments that 
fall outside of a company’s value chain. 
This includes activities that avoid or 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and 
those that remove and store greenhouse 
gases from the atmosphere.

Our Journey to net-zero 
 
JLL is committed to reducing our emissions and doing 
our part to achieve the 1.5°C target needed to avert the 
worst outcomes of global warming.
 
The built environment is estimated to account for close  
to 40% of energy-related carbon emissions, meaning  
JLL can have a significant impact through the work we  
do with our clients and our people as well as in our 
workplaces and communities.  
We recognize that the systemic nature of global warming 
requires that change be introduced across all levels of 
our organization. JLL’s net-zero target commits us to 
achieve net-zero emissions by 2040 by eliminating carbon 
emissions across all areas of business activities.
 
For JLL to achieve net-zero by 2040, all our clients need 
to be on a decarbonization journey. Helping our clients 
achieve their climate goals is a key pillar of our business 
strategy.  We are making significant investments in 
sustainability services and capabilities using the breadth 
and strength of our global platform to partner and 
collaborate with our clients and suppliers on real estate 
carbon reduction and sustainability.

JLL’s science-based 
net-zero target 
Our near-term target: JLL commits to reduce absolute 
scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions by 51% by 2030 from a 2018 
base year. Our long-term target: JLL commits to reduce 
absolute scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions by 95% by 2040 
from a 2018 base year. 
Since the publication of the first draft of Net-Zero 
Criteria, the SBTi has been going through a process 
of refining and clarifying the terminology used within 
the standard. As part of this refinement process, the 
SBTi has renamed “interim science-based targets” 
to “near-term science-based targets” and included 
a more specific term – “long-term science-based 
targets” – for emission reduction targets in line with 
net-zero. The chart (left) displays our near-term and 
long-term science-based target trajectory.

JLL has committed to achieving net-zero carbon 
emissions from the operation of our offices by 2030.
We will achieve this by improving energy efficiency in the 
buildings we already occupy and by renting offices that 
meet high-energy efficiency standards, and enhancing 
further with our fitout specifications. Where possible, 
we are moving our offices onto renewable energy 
from credible sources. Where renewable energy is not 
directly available, we are purchasing Renewable Energy 
Certificates (RECs) or equivalents.
We will address any residual emissions through the 
purchase of high-quality carbon offsets, although we  
intend to keep any such purchases to a minimum.

Office space 
Our partnership with our clients is fundamental to 
delivering net-zero, as over 96% of our emissions arise 
from the consumption in those buildings we manage on 
behalf of our clients. For JLL to be successful in achieving 
net-zero by 2040, we need to support all clients in their 
own climate action journeys. These partnerships are a 
key pillar of our business strategy. 
Our professionals offer advice on how sustainability 
considerations can be embedded across our services to 
maximize value for our clients. Supporting this strategy is 
our commitment to training and upskilling our teams on 
sustainability related topics, including climate risk, green 
building certifications, health and wellbeing, sustainable 
cities and more. A description of our complete 
sustainability services can be found on our website.

JLL is working to better understand the reduction pathway 
for our business travel impacts. We keep evolving our 
internal policies to eliminate unnecessary business travel. 
If the travel is unavoidable, we direct employees to use less 
impactful modes of transport wherever possible. In support 
of these policies, we continue to invest in technology 
solutions and provide options to support flexible working 
practices. As part of our global real estate strategy, we 
prioritise office locations that are accessible by public 
transportation to ensure our people can get to work in a 
way that is both low-cost and sustainable.

Indicators, gather data to accurately measure emissions 
reductions, and develop solutions.
Where we are making use of data centres, we will work with

Carbon offsetting
Through our commitment to net-zero, JLL has pledged to 
limit any offsetting activities to no more than 5% of our 
2018 baseline, which equates to approximately 910,000 mt 
CO2e. We will seek to minimize our use of offsets as far as is 
practicable. Within this threshold, and upon the achievement 
of our long-term target, any unabated emissions will be 
neutralized. Where we must use offsets to achieve our 
goal, we will ensure that we are choosing quantifiable, real, 
permanent, and socially beneficial options in line with best 
practice at the time of purchase.
