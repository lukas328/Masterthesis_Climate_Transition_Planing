Important  notice
This report was produced by a workstream of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (“ GFANZ”). This report aims 
to provide voluntary guidance regarding the development of net-zero transition plans by financial institutions. For the 
avoidance of doubt, nothing expressed or implied in the report is intended to prescribe a specific course of action. This 
report does not create legal relations or legally enforceable obligations of any kind. Each GFANZ sector-specific alliance 
member unilaterally determines whether, and the extent to which, it will adopt any of the potential courses of action 
described in this report.
The information in this report does not purport to be comprehensive and does not render any form of legal, tax, 
investment, accounting, financial, or other advice. This report is made available by a workstream of GFANZ and has 
not been independently verified by any person. Nothing in this report constitutes an offer or a solicitation of an offer 
to buy or sell any securities or financial instruments and does not constitute investment advice or a recommendation 
by any person of an investment or divestment strategy or whether or not to “buy,” “sell” or “hold” any security or other 
financial instrument.
The report is for informational purposes only and the information contained herein was prepared as of the date 
of publication.
No representation, warranty, assurance, or undertaking (express or implied) is or will be made, and no responsibility  
or liability is or will be accepted by any member of GFANZ, its secretariat or by any of their respective affiliates or any  
of their respective officers, employees, agents, or advisors including without limitation in relation to the adequacy,  
accuracy, completeness, or reasonableness of this report, or of any other information (whether written or oral), notice,  
or document supplied or otherwise made available to any interested party or its advisors in connection with this report.
Members of the seven financial sector-specific net-zero alliances comprising GFANZ have signed up to the ambitious 
commitments of their respective alliances and are not automatically expected to adopt the principles and frameworks 
communicated within this report, although we expect all members to increase their ambition over time, so long as it 
is consistent with members’ fiduciary and contractual duties and applicable laws and regulations, including securities, 
banking and antitrust laws.

How to Read This Report
This document is a report produced by the 
Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (“GFANZ”), 
which aims to provide financial institutions with 
background on potential avenues for meeting net-
zero commitments intended to address the financial 
and economic risks and opportunities posed by 
climate change and the transitions that would be 
necessary to mitigate those risks. In particular, this 
report sets out a framework for transition finance, 
identifying four financing strategies that could 
facilitate real-economy transitions. The report 
includes components, arranged under themes, of 
potential net-zero transition plans. Each component 
includes recommendations, case studies, and 
examples. The report does not prescribe a specific 
course of action but offers information and options 
to help those financial institutions preparing net-
zero transition plans.
Sector-specific alliance member firms include 
many different types of financial institution, 
including banks, insurers, asset owners, asset 
managers, financial service providers, and 
investment consultants. The report recognizes 
that financial institutions operate in different 
contractual and regulatory environments that 
may impact their approaches to the net-zero 
transition recommendations and voluntary/
non-binding, guidance outlined in this report. 
GFANZ acknowledges that net-zero transition 
plans will vary by institution and jurisdiction and 
will depend on the individual characteristics of 
financial institutions, including size, business 
model, sector coverage, fiduciary duty toward 
their clients, and other factors. The purpose of this 
report is to provide information that may inform 
financial institutions’ independent investment 
decision-making process in accordance with their 
contractual duties and the regulatory environment 
in which they operate.
For the purposes of this report, the term “GFANZ” 
refers to the GFANZ Principals Group .
Voluntary guidance: This report presents a voluntary 
framework for financial institutions to apply when 
developing and implementing net-zero transition 
plans. Financial institutions are encouraged to use 
all five themes in the recommendations, but may 
choose to focus on a subset of the themes that 
they determine appropriate for their organization. 
Financial institutions are encouraged to use these 
recommendations wherever possible, but not 
superseding jurisdictional requirements on transition 
planning or climate-related financial disclosure 
where such requirements exist, or contractual 
requirements, including mandates with clients. 
Some types of financial institutions may also have 
unique legal or regulatory constraints that may differ 
by jurisdiction and that may impact the extent to 
which individual elements of this guidance should 
be considered. 
Pan-sector approach:  These recommendations 
and guidance present a pan-sector approach to 
transition planning. The principle behind each 
recommendation or piece of guidance aims to 
be applicable to institutions across the financial 
sector and to act as a reference for regulators and 
policymakers. Specific methodological approaches 
or considerations for individual components 
may differ by type of financial institution, and 
the relevance may vary for different types of 
institutions. The report is principles-based so that 
it can be interpreted and applied at the discretion 
of individual financial institutions’ own processes 
and policies. Financial institutions are encouraged 
to use these recommendations and guidance 
alongside the guidance produced by sector-specific 
net-zero alliances and other organizations.

v
Unique roles for different financial institutions: 
Because this guidance is pan-sector, it does not 
reflect the different roles financial institution 
types play within the industry. Thus, as they 
develop their transition plans, financial institutions 
are encouraged to consider these types of 
relationships, focusing where they can on the 
areas where they are likely to be able to support 
client and portfolio company net-zero strategies 
and manage climate-related financial risk while 
considering all elements in this framework. Each 
financial institution is encouraged to implement 
the guidance based on considerations such 
as its business model and the contractual and 
regulatory environment within which it operates. 
The recommendations and guidance herein should 
be considered by financial institutions as resources 
and considerations that may be consulted as part 
of their transition planning efforts, not as a specific 
course of action.
Focus on development and implementation: 
This framework aims to provide an approach for 
developing and implementing transition plans, 
rather than specific guidance on disclosing 
transition plans. While GFANZ encourages 
transparent disclosure of transition plans, this 
report does not intend to provide detailed 
guidance on disclosure. Each financial institution 
should determine specific content, location, and 
frequency for disclosing the components of its  
20 TCFD. Implementing the Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures , October 2021.
transition plan, consistent with the requirements   
of their respective sector-specific alliances, 
business confidentiality, and jurisdictional 
requirements, if any. When preparing disclosures, 
institutions should consider the TCFD’s Principles 
for Effective Disclosures. 20
Institution-wide approach to transition planning:  
This guidance focuses on addressing transition 
planning from the perspective of the whole of 
a financial institution. In other words, the focus 
is on aligning the financial institution’s overall 
business strategy with the net-zero transition using 
the ten components. The guidance details how 
this strategy can be implemented throughout an 
organization but does not go into significant depth 
for individual business areas, product lines, or asset 
classes. Financial institutions should look to their 
net-zero alliance and other guidance providers for 
greater detail on how net-zero strategies can be 
developed and implemented at the level of specific 
products, services, and transactions.  
Living guidance: GFANZ acknowledges that 
supporting pathways, tools, and methodologies 
may not yet be available for all situations and 
policy, regulation, technology, and science are 
evolving, often at a rapid pace. As financial 
institutions develop and execute net-zero transition 
plans more widely, we expect the necessary tools, 
methodologies, and datasets to further develop.

Since it was launched in April 2021, the Glasgow 
Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) has been 
developing tools and methodologies to support 
financial institutions’ efforts to turn net-zero 
commitments into real action. With this report, 
we are pleased to provide a framework that 
offers resources and considerations for financial 
institution net-zero transition plans, in support 
of the financial sector’s efforts turning net-zero 
commitment into financial decision-making 
and support the orderly transition of the global 
economy to net zero.
By now, the financial and economic risks posed 
by climate change and the measures necessary 
to mitigate it are readily apparent. The science 
is clear: To have a 50% chance of keeping global 
warming to 1.5 degrees C and avoiding the worst 
impacts of climate change, we must achieve about 
a 50% reduction in emissions by 2030. Current  
 
 
challenges in the global energy market, significantly 
exacerbated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, 
have highlighted the complexity and imperative of 
securing an orderly transition, including the need to 
rapidly scale climate solutions to provide cleaner, 
more affordable, and more reliable replacements 
for unabated fossil fuels.
This transition to net zero requires companies 
across the whole economy to change behaviors 
through application of innovative technologies 
and new ways of doing business. At the same time, 
the transition should be a just one, accounting for 
impacts on cost of living, communities and workers. 
It should also protect nature and biodiversity given 
their close connection to climate. All corners of the 
financial sector will play a pivotal role in enabling 
such a whole-economy transition — from firms that 
oversee global capital allocation, financing, and 
risk management to those that supply them with 
services, advice, and systems.

vii
The 550+ members of the sector-specific alliances 
that comprise GFANZ have all committed to 
addressing the financial and economic risks and 
opportunities involved in achieving net zero. 
Translating these long-term commitments into 
action requires clear, detailed plans to help ensure 
the steps taken by the financial sector result in 
real-economy emissions reductions. The voluntary 
recommendations, to be implemented by each 
financial institution according to its role and 
business model, and guidance in this framework 
provide a set of resources and considerations 
for financial institutions for the financing and 
enablement of climate solutions, firms that are 
transitioning, and the managed phaseout of  
high-emitting physical assets. 
By establishing a pan-financial sector approach to 
transition planning, to the extent possible, taking 
into consideration each financial institution 's 
specific function in the financial sector, GFANZ 
aims to help financial institutions tackle joint 
challenges in a consistent way. This also enables 
comparability across the sector as stakeholders 
work to hold financial institutions accountable  
to their commitments. GFANZ believes this  
pan-financial sector framework will provide 
policymakers and regulators with the necessary 
insights to better understand efforts to mitigate 
climate-related risk, and to assess progress 
toward realizing national climate commitments. 
The framework also provides governments and 
standard-setters with a common global approach 
to inform disclosure guidance to further improve 
transparency and accountability.
We would like to acknowledge and express our 
gratitude to the numerous organizations which 
produced the resources highlighted throughout this 
report and especially thank the many individuals 
and institutions who have volunteered their time 
in developing this framework. In particular, we 
are grateful to Aviva and HSBC, which co-led the 
workstream that developed this  report.
We trust that financial institutions will find this 
report helpful in developing their transition plans, 
and encourage policymakers and regulators to 
reference this report as they consider policy 
regarding transition plans for the financial sector.

Governments and private-sector firms around   
the world have committed to achieving net zero 
with the goal of limiting global warming to   
1.5 degrees C. Nearly 200 countries signed the 
Glasgow Climate Pact 2021, through which they 
resolved to “pursue efforts to limit the temperature 
increase to [1.5 degrees C].” 21 At the time of writing, 
137 countries, representing 91% of global GDP, have 
made a net-zero commitment commitment along 
with thousands of companies, cities, regions, and 
other organizations. 22
These efforts are driven by the growing 
understanding of climate impacts. The latest 
assessment report from the IPCC highlights that, 
to date, climate change “has caused widespread 
adverse impacts and related losses and damages   
to nature and people,” and that projected “mid- and 
long-term impacts are up to multiple times higher 
than currently observed.” 23 This includes substantial 
risks to human health, cities, infrastructure, 
ecosystems, food production, and water availability, 
and is projected to cause significant increases in 
displacement and premature deaths, in addition 
to significant economic damages. The IPCC 
report states that “near-term actions that limit 
global warming to close to 1.5 degrees C would 
substantially reduce projected losses and damages 
related to climate change in human systems and 
ecosystems, compared to higher warming levels.” 24  
Net zero: This term refers to a state when 
anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse 
gases to the atmosphere are balanced by 
anthropogenic removals. Organizations are 
considered to have reached a state of net zero 
when they reduce their GHG emissions following 
science-based pathways, with any remaining 
GHG emissions attributable to that organization 
being fully neutralized by like-for-like removals 
exclusively claimed by that organization, either 
within the value chain or through purchase of 
valid offset credits. 25 
 
1.5 degrees C-aligned pathway: A pathway 
of emissions of greenhouse gases and other 
climate forcers that provides an approximately 
one-in-two to two-in-three chance, given current 
knowledge of the climate response, of global 
warming either remaining below 1.5 degrees C 
or returning to 1.5 degrees C by around 2100 
following an overshoot.26 Pathways giving at least 
50% probability based on current knowledge 
of limiting global warming to below 1.5 degrees 
C are classified as “no overshoot,” while those 
limiting warming to below 1.6 degrees C and 
returning to 1.5 degrees C by 2100 are classified 
as 1.5 degrees C “low overshoot.”27

TCFD has stated “transitioning to a lower-carbon 
economy may entail extensive policy, legal, 
technology, and market changes” and further that 
the nature and speed of the transition may pose 
varying levels of financial risk to organizations”. 28 
In its April 2022 report, the IPCC indicated that 
limiting global warming to around 1.5 degrees C 
requires greenhouse gas emissions to peak before 
2025 at the latest and be reduced by 43% by 2030, 
reaching net zero by 2050. 29
In order to achieve these commitments and 
drastically reduce GHG emissions, real-economy 
firms, supported by clear policy signals from 
government and finance, and related services from 
the financial sector, would have to decarbonize 
their business activities and scale climate solutions 
to replace GHG-emitting assets, products, and 
services. 30 According to a recent analysis by 
BloombergNEF (BNEF), this will require an 
unprecedented increase in financing, such that 
by the end of this decade, we need to scale clean 
energy investment such that for every dollar 
maintaining fossil fuel energy capacity, at least 
four are invested in clean energy infrastructure. 31 
The IEA also projects that the economy will need 
to more than triple annual clean energy investment

35 GFANZ uses the term “orderly transition” to refer to a net-zero transition in which both private-sector action and public-policy 
changes are early and ambitious, thereby limiting economic disruption related to the transition (e.g., mismatch between renewable 
energy supply and energy demand). For reference, the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), which develops 
climate scenarios used by regulators and others, defines “orderly scenarios” as those with “early, ambitious action to a net zero 
CO2 emissions economy,” as opposed to disorderly scenarios (with “action that is late, disruptive, sudden and/or unanticipated”). 
In an orderly transition, both physical climate risks and transition risks are minimized relative to disorderly transitions or scenarios 
where planned emissions reductions are not achieved. (NGFS. NGFS Climate Scenarios for Central Banks and Supervisors , 2020.) 
The Paris Agreement, Article 4.1 , highlighted that achievement should be “on the basis of equity, and in the context of sustainable 
development and efforts to eradicate poverty,” and the agreement acknowledged that “human rights, the right to health, the rights 
of indigenous peoples, local communities, migrants, children, persons with disabilities and people in vulnerable situations and the 
right to development, as well as gender equality, empowerment of women and intergenerational equity” are equally important.
this decade to around $4 trillion by 2030 to limit 
warming to 1.5 degrees C. 32 In addition, other 
studies estimate cumulative global investment 
requirements of US$109 –$275 trillion to reach 
net-zero emissions by 2050.33 GFANZ was founded 
because investment of this scale requires the 
mobilization of the entire financial system. 34
The private financial sector has the scale to 
mobilize the necessary capital and financing with 
more than 500 financial institutions, representing 
around 40% of global financial assets, committed to 
the goal of net zero by 2050 through membership 
in one of the financial sector-specific alliances 
comprising GFANZ. With deliberate and ambitious 
action, alongside government and real-economy 
efforts, the financial sector can help enable a global 
transition to net zero that helps avoid the worst 
impacts of climate change, minimizes firm-specific 
transition risks and stranded assets as well as 
broader risks to financial stability, and is just and 
orderly35 across countries and communities.
In addition, governments and regulators of some of 
the world’s largest economies are requiring financial 
institutions and real-economy firms to disclose 
climate-related risks and opportunities, including

forward-looking disclosures on climate strategy. 36 
This includes specific reference to transition plans 
that articulate how firms expect to achieve transition 
objectives, whether stemming from national policy 
or their own commitments. 37 Currently, there is 
limited financial sector-wide resources to support 
firms in developing and implementing credible, 
science-aligned transition plans. This report is 
designed to provide voluntary recommendations 
and guidance to financial institutions to support 
their efforts to develop and implement net-zero 
36 TCFD. 2021 Status Report , October 2021, p. 5 –6.
37 For example, the UK government has formed a Transition Planning Taskforce to develop a “gold standard” for disclosure of 
transition plans, and the EU’s EFRAG has issued draft European Sustainability Reporting Standards for consultation that include 
aspects of transition planning for disclosure.

transition plans, and to the public sector to inform 
policies on transition planning. We have sought 
to develop recommendations and guidance with 
global, cross-sectoral applicability to reduce the 
frictions that could otherwise impede the financial 
sector from playing its full part in delivering on our 
collective climate goals.
Real economy: This refers to economic activity 
outside of the financial sector. 
This report
Transition plans translate an institution’s net-
zero commitment into specific objectives and 
actions that are aimed at reducing real-economy 
GHG emissions, and providing credibility and 
accountability to net-zero commitments.  
This report sets out GFANZ’s view on transition 
finance, identifying four key financing strategies 
that GFANZ believes are essential to driving 
the real-economy transition. In order to deliver 
transition finance with rigor and accountability, 
GFANZ introduces ten components, arranged 
under five themes, of credible net-zero 
transition plans. Each component comprises a 
recommendation, guidance, case studies, and 
examples. The report also identifies possible areas 
for further work that financial market participants 
should consider as the sector advances its 
transition planning efforts.
GFANZ aims to accelerate adoption of current 
best practices (recognizing that these will 
inevitably change) and promote consistency in the 
development and use of transition plans across 
the financial sector. We have included illustrative 
examples from individual institutions representing 
efforts to address one or more elements of the 
guidance for specific components. These are not 
intended to represent “best practice” nor represent 
the entirety of guidance for a component. 38 Instead, 
the examples are included because they may help 
financial institutions interpret individual elements of 
the guidance for their own practices.
GFANZ is grateful to our partners, the sector-
specific net-zero alliances, and to the wide range 
of organizations that have developed detailed 
guidance and other resources in the area of 
transition planning and on which this report is based.

BOX 1. BACKGROUND ON GFANZ WORK PROGRAM 
GFANZ is a global coalition of leading financial institutions that is committed to accelerating and 
mainstreaming the decarbonization of the world economy and reaching net-zero emissions by 2050. 
GFANZ brings together seven financial sector-specific net-zero alliances, representing more than 500 
members, into a global strategic alliance to address common challenges and elevate best practices 
across the sector. GFANZ core areas of work are practitioner-led and advised by leading technical civil 
society organizations. 39

*GFANZ uses the term “energy transition” to refer to a net-zero transition in which both private sector and public policy changes 
are early and ambitious, thereby limiting economic disruption related to the transition (e.g. mismatch between renewable energy 
supply and energy demand). For reference, the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), which develops climate 
scenarios used by regulators and others, defines “orderly scenarios” as those with “early, ambitious action to a net-zero GHG 
emissions economy,” as opposed to disorderly scenarios (with “action that is late, disruptive, sudden and/or unanticipated”). In 
an orderly transition, both physical climate risks and transition risks are minimized relative to disorderly transitions or scenarios 
where planned emissions reductions are not achieved. This explanation applies to all mentions of the term “orderly transition” in 
this document.

As part of the 2022 work program, GFANZ developed a series of related tools, frameworks, and 
other resources to support transition planning across the financial sector, with the goal of financing 
and enabling the real-economy transition to net zero. Collectively, this work provides a framework 
to ensure that financial institutions’ net-zero transition plans are grounded in science and provide 
appropriate accountability.
In addition to this report on net-zero transition plans for financial institutions, this work includes:

Defining transition finance
40 In this report, “climate solutions” is used to refer to solutions that support mitigation of climate change and emissions reduction. 
GFANZ acknowledges that a broader use of the term may include solutions that are aimed at developing adaptation.
41 In this report, unless specified, “assets” can refer to physical or financial assets or both depending on the application to various 
financial products, services, and business models. Physical assets are also known as tangible assets. For most businesses, physical 
assets usually refer to properties, equipment, and inventory. A financial asset is an asset that derives its value from a contractual 
right or ownership claim. Cash, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and bank deposits are all examples of financial assets.
42 Bank of England Executive Director Sarah Breeden highlighted this risk in a speech .
ALIGNING THE FINANCIAL SECTOR WITH 
THE NET-ZERO TRANSITION 
Financial institutions have a vital role in supporting 
the real economy by facilitating the allocation of 
capital and providing related services. GFANZ is 
providing recommendations and guidance in this 
framework for financial institutions to assess their 
existing business activities with a lens of climate 
and emissions reduction as a significant driver. 
Activities include all aspects of the financial sector, 
including redirecting capital, providing net zero-
aligned financial products and services, working 
with real-economy firms as they develop and 
implement ambitious and credible strategies and 
activities for the transition, and engaging with 
policymakers to create an enabling environment for 
these changes.
Climate solutions:  Technologies, services, 
tools, or social and behavioral changes that 
directly contribute to the elimination, removal, 
or reduction of real-economy GHG emissions 
or that directly support the expansion of these 
solutions. These solutions include scaling up 
zero-carbon alternatives to high-emitting 
activities — a prerequisite to phasing out high-
emitting assets — as well as nature-based 
solutions and carbon removal technologies. 40
Actions taken by financial institutions to 
decarbonize their portfolios and businesses 
may not drive real-world decarbonization; for 
example, reducing financed emissions by selling 
the high-emitting assets in a portfolio 41 or ending 
existing business with high-emitting firms does 
not necessarily decrease global GHG emissions, 
as buyers or new providers of capital may not be 
committed to net-zero goals.42 Financial institutions 
should consider the potential for real-economy 
emissions reduction in their activities, recognizing 
that the greatest emissions reduction may be 
achieved by directing financing and related services 
to — rather than divesting from — firms and assets 
that need to transition. In other words, financial 
institutions should focus not only on reducing 
their financed emissions , but also on financing 
emissions reduction . GFANZ believes that such an 
approach to transition finance is essential to driving 
the real-economy transition.
GFANZ has identified four key financing strategies 
that define transition finance. These strategies 
(shown on the next page) are inclusive of financing, 
investment, insurance, and related products and 
services that are critical to delivering real-economy 
emissions reduction in support of an orderly, net-
zero transition of the global economy:  
CONTENTS  |  FINANCIAL INSTITUTION NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLANS — FUNDAMENTALS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND GUIDANCE
9
1. Climate solutions: Financing or enabling entities 
and activities that develop and scale climate 
solutions. This strategy encourages the expansion 
of low-emitting technologies and services, including 
nature-based solutions, to replace high-emitting 
technologies or services, remove greenhouse gases 
from the atmosphere, or otherwise accelerate the 
net-zero transition in a just manner. An example may 
be a company that produces green hydrogen or a 
project on regenerative agriculture.
2. Aligned: Financing or enabling entities that are 
already aligned to a 1.5 degrees C pathway. This 
strategy supports climate leaders and signals that 
the financial sector is seeking transition alignment 
behavior from the real-economy companies with 
which it does business.43 An example may be a 
company with an SBTi-validated target and whose 
progress reports demonstrate achievement against 
the target or a company whose climate transition 
plan and performance is assessed by the World 
Benchmarking Alliance.
3. Aligning: Financing or enabling entities 
committed to transitioning in line with 1.5 degrees 
C-aligned pathways. This strategy supports both 
high-emitting and low-emitting firms that have 
robust net-zero transition plans,44 set targets 
aligned to sectoral pathways,45 and implement 
changes in their business to deliver on their net-
zero targets. An example may be a manufacturer 
who is implementing energy efficiency and 
clean energy projects to reduce its Scope 1 
and 2 emissions or a retailer engaging with its 
supply chain to invest in Scope 3 emissions 
reduction projects.
43 Financial institutions could use emissions disclosures, portfolio alignment metrics, and transition plans for assessing alignment, 
as well as third-party verification programs where available. Financial institutions should be transparent about the methodologies 
and data they are using to determine alignment while industry standards are still maturing. Note that while the pool of already-
aligned companies is currently small, it is expected to grow as the transition progresses.

46 Please see The Managed Phaseout of High-emitting Assets , 2022, by GFANZ for a discussion on the need for an identification 
framework for eligible assets.
47 IPCC’s AR6 cites the “combined global discounted value of the unburned fossil fuels and stranded fossil fuel infrastructure has 
been projected to be around 1-4 trillion dollars from 2015 to 2050 to limit global warming to approximately 2 degree C, and it will 
be higher if global warming is limited to approximately 1.5 degrees C.” p. 36 –37.
4. Managed phaseout: Financing or enabling the 
accelerated managed phaseout (e.g., via early 
retirement) of high-emitting physical assets. 46 
This strategy facilitates significant emissions 
reduction by the identification and planned early 
retirement of assets while managing critical issues 
of service continuity and community interests. 
GFANZ believes this activity is essential to reducing 
global emissions and supporting a smooth and 
just economic transition. An example may be an 
identified fossil fuel power plant with a plan in 
place for early decommissioning on a timeframe 
consistent with the broader net-zero trajectory.
Managed phaseout projects:  Targeted efforts 
to reduce GHG emissions through accelerated 
retirement of high-emitting physical assets 
(shortening their operating life). Financial 
institutions can finance or enable strategies 
for managed phaseout of these assets within a 
defined science-aligned time horizon, thereby 
limiting the likelihood that these assets will 
be stranded in a low-carbon future. 47 These 
projects require appropriate scrutiny and 
governance to ensure that emissions reduction 
occurs as planned. Further information can 
be found in the Managed Phaseout of High-
emitting Assets report, which outlines the 
challenges and opportunities for financial 
institutions in these transactions, as well as 
details on how financial institutions can develop 
strategies for managed phaseout projects.

Transition finance: Investment, financing, 
insurance, and related products and services 
that are necessary to support an orderly, real-
economy transition to net zero as described by 
the four key financing strategies that finance 
or enable 1) entities and activities that develop 
and scale climate solutions; 2) entities that are 
already aligned to a 1.5 degrees C pathway; 
3) entities committed to transitioning in line 
with 1.5 degrees C-aligned pathways; or 4) the 
accelerated managed phaseout of high-emitting 
physical assets.
Scenario: Projections of what can happen  
by creating plausible, coherent, and internally 
consistent descriptions of possible climate 
change futures. Scenarios are not predictions  
of the future.48
Pathway: A goal-oriented scenario or 
combination of scenarios answering the 
question “What needs to happen?” to 
accomplish a specific objective (e.g., what are 
the steps needed to reach net zero by 2050, 
limit global warming to 1.5 degrees C, with low 
or no overshoot?).49
While the financing strategies are not intended  
to serve as a formal taxonomy, they can provide  
a lens for understanding whether and how 
particular assets, activities, or clients may be 
aligned to the transition. In the early stages of 
the transition, opportunities to finance or enable 
companies, projects, real assets, and sovereigns 
under these financing strategies may be limited. 
As the global community progresses toward 
net zero, GFANZ expects the availability of such 
opportunities to increase and the allocation of 
portfolios to these four key financing strategies  
to grow correspondingly.
These financing strategies should inform business 
strategy and support decision-making across the 
organization, along with other key financial, risk, 
48 Definition taken from GFANZ. Guidance on Use of Sectoral Pathways for Financial Institutions , 2022.

and noneconomic considerations. They provide an 
approach to net-zero financing that recognizes that 
climate-related risks — transition and physical — 
should be integrated into financial decision-making.
The above financing strategies may not be mutually 
exclusive, and some transactions or activities 
might support multiple strategies. For example, 
firms developing climate solutions may be already 
aligned to net zero or in the process of aligning. 
Financial activity across all four key financing 
strategies may also intersect with areas of just 
transition and biodiversity and nature. These are 
areas of active work by various initiatives as laid out 
in the Financial Institution Net-zero Transition Plans 
— Supplemental Information report. Considerations 
for financial institutions in these areas could range 
from avoiding unintended negative effects on social 
groups or nature to seeking societal and nature co-
benefits alongside transition activities while pan-
sector standards are built.
A high level of rigor and accountability in the 
application of the four key financing strategies 
is critical to ensure that financial institutions are 
supporting a whole-economy transition while 
achieving emissions reduction in the needed 
timeframes. The transition plan framework in this 
report — consisting of five themes comprising ten 
components, detailed in Part C — provide resources 
and considerations for financial institutions on 
financing, investment, and financial services; 
measuring progress; and structuring governance 
of ambitious and credible transition plans. The 
framework structure of the five themes supports 
the provision of finance and related services to 
real-economy activities that advance the net-
zero transition. These activities may not result in 
immediate reductions in financed (or equivalent) 
GHG emissions for a financial institution but are 
necessary actions to support an orderly whole-
economy transition to net zero by 2050.

BOX 2. SECTORAL PATHWAYS FOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS50 
An orderly transition to net zero entails the continued availability of essential goods and services 
to the global economy while replacing high-emitting technologies with low-emitting or carbon-free 
alternatives. This requires reimagining the technologies and sometimes business models of certain 
sectors such that the carbon intensity and absolute emissions of those sectors decline over time. The 
nature of that shift, including its pace and related economic activities, is referred to as a “pathway.” 
Sectoral pathways provide the link between the science of the remaining carbon budget and the 
detailed steps that a specific sector could take to reduce GHG emissions to a particular level in a 
specified timeframe.  
GFANZ’s report Guidance on Use of Sectoral Pathways for Financial Institutions is intended as a 
guide to support financial institutions’ use of sectoral pathways in creating net-zero transition plans; 
in aligning of their portfolios; and in engaging with real-economy firms. By providing a framework 
for comparing pathways by commonly referenced providers (e.g., IPCC, IEA, OECM, MPP), financial 
institutions can understand the assumptions and outputs of the different pathways and choose the 
pathways most appropriate for their net-zero objectives. The framework ensures they understand 
the types, timeframes, and scale of investments they may need to make or discontinue. GFANZ will 
supplement this report with sector-specific reports that will include analyses of net-zero, 1.5 degrees 
C-aligned pathways.
Pathway developers can also use the insights provided in the report to improve the usability of  
their pathways.

GFANZ’s program of work will help further 
adoption and clarify what financing is in 
furtherance of the net-zero transition, including 
resources and considerations on transition plans for 
real-economy firms ,51 sectoral pathways,52 managed

promoting more ambitious climate policy from 
governments;55 and increasing the accessibility of 
climate transition data, including better information 
on transition-related capital allocation, through 
support of a new open data public utility. 56 
GFANZ recognizes that financial institutions 
implementing the recommendations and guidance 
contained in this report will face challenges. The 
private financial sector’s actions will influence 
the pace and shape of the transition but will be 
more effective with ambitious policy action from 
governments in line with the net-zero pledges they 
have made. Additional action may be needed from 
government and other actors in the ecosystem, 
particularly relating to business with or investment 
in high-emitting sectors and emerging markets and 
developing economies. Progress is needed in these 
areas, among others:
• more granular and fit-for-purpose regional 
and sectoral pathways, to identify priorities for 
public policy and investment opportunities in 
climate solutions and to better inform net-zero 
alignment for specific real-economy companies 
and activities;
• higher-ambition public policy to accelerate the 
transition e.g., climate disclosure that includes 
transition plans, taxonomies, and clarity on

national plans to transition specific sectors 
to net zero (the GFANZ Policy Call to Action 
outlines the areas where government action   
is needed to accelerate the transition 57);
• higher-ambition action by real-economy 
companies (e.g., accelerated uptake of emerging 
technologies, adoption of robust transition 
plans); and
• the development of relevant methodologies 
and accounting practices for businesses and 
asset classes where they do not currently 
exist (e.g., methodologies for insured and 
facilitated emissions).
The current challenges in global energy markets, 
significantly exacerbated by the Russian invasion 
of Ukraine, have highlighted the complexity and 
the imperative of securing an orderly transition. 
This requires rapid scaling of climate solutions to 
replace fossil fuels and the accelerated phaseout 
of fossil fuel energy sources in an orderly and 
just manner. At the same time, any financing to 
fossil fuel companies — to ensure continuity of 
energy supply in the interim — should consider the 
timelines in a science-based 1.5 degrees C pathway 
to ensure the energy sector continues along 
a net-zero transition and is not supporting the 
development of assets that will be stranded. 
GFANZ urges financial institutions to be aggressive 
when developing their net-zero strategies, as the 
next few years are crucial for the state of climate 
change. Without deep emissions reduction by 2030 
across all sectors, the IPCC warns that it will be 
impossible to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees C.58

Net-zero transition plans
59 Pathways giving at least 50% probability based on current knowledge of limiting global warming to below 1.5 degrees C are 
classified as “no overshoot,” while those limiting warming to below 1.6 degrees C and returning to 1.5 degrees C by 2100 are 
classified as “1.5 degrees C limited overshoot.”
60 These requirements reflect sector-specific alliance member  commitments.
61 Through their net-zero alliances, members have all committed to setting an interim target for 2030 or sooner.
GFANZ defines a net-zero transition plan as follows: 
A net-zero transition plan is a set of goals, 
actions, and accountability mechanisms to align 
an organization’s business activities with a 
pathway to net-zero GHG emissions that delivers 
real -economy emissions reduction in line with 
achieving global net zero. For GFANZ members, 
a transition plan should be consistent with 
achieving net zero by 2050, at the latest, in line 
with commitments and global efforts to limit 
warming to 1.5 degrees C, above pre-industrial 
levels, with low or no overshoot. 59, 60, 61
Net-zero transition plans are foundational to 
operationalizing commitments and demonstrating 
the credibility of a financial institution’s net-zero 
pledge. A transition plan is both a strategic planning 
tool and a practical action plan. It translates an 
institution’s net-zero commitment into specific 
objectives and actions that are aimed at reducing 
real-economy GHG emissions. A transition plan 
supports accountability and signals to both internal 
and external audiences that an institution’s steps 
toward net zero are deliberate, transparent, and   
can be monitored. It also illustrates to stakeholders 
that a financial institution is taking the transition 
risks it faces seriously, working to mitigate them  
as the transition to a net-zero economy progresses. 
The breadth of a net-zero transition plan requires 
revisiting strategies, governance, incentives, and 
other fundamental business considerations. The 
four key financing strategies provide a lens through 
which an institution can review its entire business. 
The review should assess how the allocation of 
capital and provision of related services can enable 
real-economy GHG emissions reduction and thus 
form the basis of a transition strategy that can 
be embedded throughout the organization. The 
details of a transition plan should articulate how the 
strategy will be executed and how the institution 
will measure and govern its effectiveness. Details 
differ depending on an institution’s business model, 
operating environment (economic and geographic), 
sphere of influence, and portfolio composition.
Executing on a transition plan requires action across 
various areas within a financial institution, but also 
from a financial institution’s clients or portfolio 
companies. Financial institutions should work with 
all relevant clients and portfolio companies to 
understand their targets and plans, to support 
not only expanding climate solutions, but also 
delivering near-term, real-world GHG emissions 
reduction in line with the need for substantial 
reductions by 2030. This includes identifying 
their most significant sources of emissions and 
developing strategies to finance their  reduction.

In developing this guidance, we have taken a 
comprehensive approach to identifying the core 
common elements that a credible transition plan 
should contain if it is to be practically useful to 
a financial institution and enable the financial 
institution to fulfill its commitment. While the focus 
is on providing guidance for financial institutions’ 
implementation of transition strategies, the 
recommendations and guidance also highlight 
the clear, consistent, and decision-useful types of 
information needed by other stakeholders including 
regulators and governments. The recommendations 
and guidance have global applicability to 
encourage consistency in financing strategies 
across the sector, although implementation will 
depend on each institution 's specific role and 
business model.
Transition planning is not a one-time exercise. 
As the global net-zero transition progresses and 
financial institutions assess their strategies with 
improved and new climate-related scenarios and 
sectoral pathways, it is important that transition 
plans are regularly reviewed and updated, 
especially in light of the rapid pace of change. 
At the same time, our understanding of what 
constitutes best practice will evolve, and we will 
continue efforts to refine the recommendations and 
guidance in years to come in collaboration with our 
net-zero partners across the financial sector. 
An economy-wide net-zero transition requires 
effort from multiple stakeholders. GFANZ is 
committed to engaging with wider stakeholders 
including financial regulators, supervisors, industry 
initiatives, real-economy representatives, and civil 
society organizations to ensure that application of 
these recommendations and guidance will produce 
the information they need to evaluate transition 
planning efforts and the associated climate risk 
mitigation, and better inform them of progress. 
This includes:
• providing microprudential and macroprudential 
supervisors and regulators with insight into how 
financial institutions’ transitions, individually 
and collectively, may impact firm-specific and 
sector-wide financial stability risks, including 
transparency on the efforts individual firms are 
taking to mitigate their transition risks;
• providing governments and policymakers 
with insight into how the financial system, 
through its capital allocation, is able to support 
the transition to net zero, and to identify 
challenges requiring policy intervention, such 
that governments can deliver on their own 
commitments to net zero;
• providing securities regulators and other 
stakeholders with insight into the actions being 
taken by financial institutions and companies to 
deliver on their stated commitments; 
• providing real-economy companies with a 
view to the transition-related information that 
financial institutions need for their own net-zero 
transition plan and therefore expect from real-
economy companies; and
• providing civil society with the consistent 
information to form a global, pan-sector view 
of net-zero transition planning for financial 
institutions that will allow monitoring and 
measurement of progress across the sector.

The purpose of this report is to set out globally 
applicable, voluntary recommendations and 
guidance for transition planning by financial 
institutions, GFANZ’s view on the key components 
of a credible net-zero transition plan, and to provide 
case studies and examples to accelerate adoption. 
A “credible” plan refers to one that is actionable, 
measurable, with long-term targets but focused 
on near-term action, based on climate science, 
and against which there is accountability and 
transparency on underlying strategy and progress.62 
Members of the sector-specific alliances comprising 
GFANZ have each committed to support the goal 
of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 or 
sooner, in line with global efforts under the Paris 
Agreement. Each sector alliance establishes the 
commitment criteria for membership. Commitments 
include achieving net zero by 2050 at the latest 
and setting interim targets for 2030 reflecting 
maximum effort toward a fair share of the 50% 
global reduction in GHG emissions needed by 2030. 
Commitment criteria are understood differently 
by each sectoral alliance comprising GFANZ, as 
each sector has different functions and roles in the 
financial system. In particular, for institutions 
acting as fiduciaries to their beneficiaries, the scope 
of financing services and products may be reliant 
on financial risks associated with transition to net 
zero. This framework can be helpful to develop 
and implement net-zero transition plans in line with 
these timelines and commitments. Other financial 
institutions may find this report useful whether  
they have yet to publicly commit to net zero or  
if they have net-zero targets beyond 2050. These 
institutions are encouraged to prioritize near-term 
action and ground their transition planning  
process in climate science and pathways aligned  
to 1.5 degrees C. 
The recommendations in this report build on the 
work of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial 
Disclosures63 (TCFD); guidance and insights 
developed by the sector-specific net-zero alliances; 
research from non-government organizations 
(NGOs), scientists, academics, industry, and other 
technical experts; and learnings from financial 
institutions that have already developed transition 
plans.64 GFANZ is grateful to the wide range of 
organizations referenced in this report that have 
developed guidance and other resources to 
support the critical work of transition planning.

BOX 3. BUILDING ON TCFD: CLIMATE-RELATED FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE, AND NET-ZERO PLANS
The TCFD provides important, widely-accepted recommendations and implementing guidelines for 
disclosing climate-related financial information. The TCFD recommends companies, including financial 
institutions, describe how resilient their strategies are to climate-related risks and opportunities —
including those related to physical climate impacts and impacts of the transition to a lower-carbon 
economy — by leveraging a set of climate-related scenarios. Scenario analysis can help companies 
frame and assess the potential range of plausible business, strategic, and financial impacts from 
climate change and the associated management actions that may need to be considered in strategic 
and financial plans. Net-zero transition planning describes how strategies will support 1.5 degrees C  
alignment, accelerating the transition to a net-zero global economy and thereby minimizing the 
likelihood of increasing climate  impacts.
In October 2021, the TCFD published additional guidance on disclosing climate-related metrics and 
targets and key information from transition plans for all sectors, noting that “organizations’ transition 
plans are of particular interest to users (e.g., investors, lenders, and insurance underwriters), especially 
when they are seeking to verify the credibility of organizations’ commitments related to climate 
change.”65, 66 The Task Force’s guidance — intended to cover a wide range of organizations — provides 
high-level information on considerations for transition plans and key information to disclose. As such, 
the guidance does not provide transition plan guidance specific to the financial sector or address how 
firms can develop and implement these plans. 
This report complements the TCFD guidance on transition plans by presenting recommendations 
and guidance for financial institutions to develop and execute on net-zero transition plans. A net-zero 
transition plan has a specific, forward-looking objective: to support global efforts to limit temperature 
increases to 1.5 degrees C and reach net-zero emissions by 2050. In doing so, it also serves to 
provide details on how an organization is working to mitigate the transition risk it faces. For financial 
institutions, a net-zero transition plan should build on its TCFD-related or other climate-related 
disclosure work. The plan should use findings from its scenario analysis to detail the business levers 
the institution will use to achieve goals around both emissions reduction and transition risk mitigation 
and, therefore, ultimately contribute to addressing systemic climate risk. 
GFANZ recognizes that transition plan disclosure provides transparency and enhances the credibility 
of financial institutions’ net-zero transition efforts and, collectively, those of the financial sector. 
GFANZ has provided suggestions on what this disclosure might include but recognizes that 
developing detailed recommendations for disclosure requires a separate effort to properly consider 
more detailed disclosure guidance than what is covered in this report.

DISCLOSURE
While the focus of this framework is on developing 
and implementing transition plans, an important 
part of the commitment that financial institutions 
have made through their sector-specific alliances 
is disclosure. Financial institutions themselves 
are beginning to make such disclosures on a 
voluntary basis and should continue to do so 
following guidance and requirements from various 
domestic and international bodies. This guidance 
is not focused on disclosure, but GFANZ believes 
financial institutions should be transparent 
about key elements of their transition plan in a 
clear, consistent, and comparable way. GFANZ 
recommends that financial institutions disclose 
their net-zero transition plans, including interim 
targets, to stakeholders and disclose progress 
against their plans with their climate disclosures  
at least annually.
Each financial institution should determine specific 
content, location, and frequency for disclosing 
the components of its transition plan, consistent 
with the requirements of their respective sector-
specific alliances and jurisdictional requirements, 
if any. When preparing disclosure, institutions 
should consider the TCFD’s Principles for Effective 
Disclosures. An organization should indicate how 
its transition plan forms part of its response to 
climate-related risks and opportunities previously 
identified through TCFD reporting, and the residual 
risk to the organization from incorporating the 
actions outlined in the transition plan.
67 For the purposes of this report, “financed emissions” or “portfolio emissions” include those associated with a financial institution’s 
investment, lending, and underwriting portfolios, or from clients of investment consultants or financial service providers.
68 CDP found that financed emissions could be 700 times greater than a financial institution’s own operational emissions .
69 PCAF. GHG Protocol Chapter 15 . Also, The Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the Financial Industry .
70 This report uses “financed emissions” and “portfolio emissions” interchangeably.
71 GFANZ encourages the use of the PCAF Standards, built on and accepted by the GHG Inventory Protocol, Category 15, and 
acknowledges their ongoing work to further develop and refine methodological guidance to measure and disclose GHG emissions 
associated with different asset classes and categories of financial activity and for financial institutions to utilize these standards, 
as appropriate, as they are released (e.g., at the time of writing, PCAF is working on insured emissions and capital market 
instruments  methodologies).
DEFINING THE SCOPE OF EMISSIONS 
COVERED BY THESE RECOMMENDATIONS
This report covers financial institutions’ Scope 3 
financed emissions 67 consistent with the sector-
specific net-zero alliance commitments. Scope 3 
methodologies are still evolving, including in the 
financial sectors where the same real-economy 
emissions can be counted multiple times in 
the investment chain. The concept of financed 
emissions, especially relevant for banks and 
asset owners, is complemented by other evolving 
approaches appropriate to asset managers, 
insurers, service providers, and other financial 
services actors. 
Financial institutions will have a much greater 
impact on global GHG emissions by targeting 
the reduction of their financed GHG emissions, 
which are significantly larger than their operational 
emissions.68 These emissions include those 
associated with a financial institution’s investment, 
lending, and underwriting portfolios, or from  
clients of investment consultants or financial  
service providers. 69, 70, 71
As shown in Figure 4, financial institutions’ net-zero 
commitments should cover at least the Scope 1 
and Scope 2 emissions associated with clients or 
portfolio companies. They should also cover Scope 
3 emissions associated with clients or portfolio 
companies in sectors that are significant climate 
change contributors or where company Scope 3 
emissions are material and can be incorporated

THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN NET-ZERO 
TRANSITION PLANNING, FINANCIAL 
RISK MANAGEMENT, AND ADAPTATION 
FINANCE
The recommendations and guidance in this 
report are focused on a forward-looking plan of 
action toward a net-zero commitment that can be 
implemented by a financial institution. 
While there is significant overlap between  
climate-related risk management and transition 
planning, each activity has different objectives. 
Climate-related risk management focuses on the 
integration of climate-related financial risks into risk 
governance, processes, and strategies. The net-
zero transition plan should represent the strategic 
alignment of a financial institution’s core business 
and build upon, but look beyond, an institution’s 
own risk profile to support the net-zero transition  
in the real economy.
As seen in Figure 5, net-zero transition planning  
will be informed by firms’ efforts to identify 
climate-related risks and opportunities, in particular 
transition risks. Transition risks include a broad 
range of risks, including the possibility that high-
emitting assets or activities will lose value or 
be stranded in a low-carbon future, as well as 
new risks stemming from the scaling of climate 
solution technologies and processes. Moreover, 
transition planning and climate risk management

emissions) and are mutually supportive: Effective

institutions and real-economy firms. At the same 
time, transition planning addresses an institution’s 
transition risk and, when efforts are aggregated 
across the financial sector, aims to help mitigate 
physical climate risk.

Adaptation and finance to build resilience are  
still nascent and evolving.73 Aligning finance  
with climate resilience aims to strengthen the  
ability of a region or community to withstand 
physical impacts of climate change, including  
risks to which financial institutions may be exposed. 
Net-zero transition plans are focused on climate 
change mitigation. Carried out globally, actions 
aligned with the net-zero transition aim to mitigate 
future physical impacts from climate change by 
limiting projected warming.  
 
 
While adaptation financing is not designed to 
decarbonize the real economy, financial institutions 
should consider pursuing opportunities where 
mitigation and adaptation efforts are closely 
linked and support both sets of objectives. At a 
minimum, mitigation efforts should be reviewed 
for unintended consequences that impede 
adaptation efforts.

Working with our partners
The recommendations and guidance in this report 
are pan-sector and aim to be broadly applicable to 
all types of financial institutions. This report is built 
on the invaluable industry-specific knowledge and 
expertise of the financial sector-specific net-zero 
alliances that comprise GFANZ. The alliances have 
produced resources and guidance on the net-zero 
transition targeted to their members’ specific 
business models and regulatory constraints. The 
alliances’ guidance — covering target setting, 
transition planning, and related efforts — though 
tailored to their specific industries, contributes 
immeasurably to the creation of a clear path 
forward that is vital to mobilizing the entire 
financial sector and reducing fragmentation.  
This report is intended to be complementary 
to, rather than supersede, industry-specific 
resources already in use by alliance members. 
The recommendations and guidance herein aim 
to encourage greater consistency, ambition, and 
comparability across the financial sector. The 
guidance in this report can be used in many ways, 
depending on the financial institution type and 
maturity of its net-zero transition. 
For financial institutions in alliances that have not 
yet developed an overarching transition planning 
framework, this report provides such a framework, 
alongside more targeted guidance on specific 
components from the net-zero alliance(s). For 
financial institutions that have already developed 
transition plans based on alliance guidance, this 
report provides additional details or examples on 
individual components.  
GFANZ encourages financial institutions to use 
the recommendations, guidance, and case studies 
in this report alongside the guidance produced 
by their relevant net-zero alliance(s). Financial 
institutions should look to their net-zero alliance 
when considering how this framework can be 
applied to support implementation of their net-  
zero commitment.

regulatory disclosures or chosen disclosure 
platforms, but it is not an exhaustive list. 
If disclosing a transition plan within the framework 
of the TCFD, Foundations, Implementation Strategy, 
and Engagement Strategy themes may fit with the 
TCFD Strategy disclosure because they discuss how 
a financial institution may approach its strategy to 
align with the net-zero transition. Further, the Metrics 
and Targets theme aligns with the TCFD Metrics and 
Targets disclosure recommendations. Lastly, the 
Governance theme aligns with the TCFD Governance 
disclosure recommendations.

Use of the FI NZTP Framework
This section provides recommendations and 
guidance on the components GFANZ believes  
are essential for a credible net-zero transition plan  
from a financial institution. GFANZ acknowledges 
that the act of developing net-zero transition plans 
will vary by jurisdiction and will depend on the  
individual characteristics of each financial institution, 
including size, business model, sector coverage, 
and other factors. The following recommendations 
and guidance use a principles-based approach to 
allow for such flexibility, but GFANZ encourages 
financial institutions to address all components 
where possible. We have included examples and 
case studies to illustrate specific elements of the 
guidance in practice at the time of writing. 
GFANZ also acknowledges that supporting 
pathways, tools, and methodologies may not  
be available for all situations, but expects that 
implementation of specific components will  
mature and change over time as financial  
institutions develop and execute net-zero transition 
plans more widely, and as the circumstances — 
including risks, opportunities, and regulatory 
considerations — evolve.
Please refer to the “How to read this report ” at 
the beginning of this report for the overarching 
considerations the reader should keep in mind 
when reading the following recommendations 
and guidance. These include the voluntary nature 
of the recommendations and guidance, the need 
to interpret this guidance within the financial 
institution’s individual business characteristics and 
jurisdictions within which it operates, and from an 
implementation rather than disclosure point of view.

74 A “credible” plan in this report refers to one that is actionable, focused on the near term, and aligned with a 1.5 degrees C carbon 
budget with low or no overshoot, according to the latest findings of the IPCC.
75 Through their net-zero alliances, members have all committed to setting an interim target for 2030 or sooner.
76 Four key financing strategies to support the net-zero transition for financial institutions were outlined in Part  B.
Clear net-zero objectives and priorities underpin a detailed, credible transition plan. 74
Once a financial institution has committed to achieving net-zero GHG emissions by 2050 or sooner, 
it should articulate its objectives and priorities, along with specifics such as targets, the timeline for 
achieving objectives, and how they will be achieved. Joining one of the net-zero sector-specific alliances 
adds credibility, as does a statement from a senior executive communicating the institution’s net-zero 
objective and priority areas. Many ambition statements will be defined by the commitments of the sector-
specific alliance the financial institution joined. However, there is some flexibility in defining the specific 
objectives, scope, and approaches to achieving the targets, including allowance for more ambitious goals.
Financial institutions will take different approaches to achieving net-zero targets and prioritize areas of 
their business depending on factors including the size of the organization, their business model, influence, 
operating environment, portfolio and client characteristics, and geographic coverage. As detailed in the 
“Defining transition finance” section, the key financing strategies that financial institutions may choose 
to prioritize are focused on financing climate solutions, supporting already aligned firms, supporting real-
economy firms committed to aligning, and financing managed phaseout projects. Defining these priorities 
allows an institution to develop a detailed and strategic net-zero transition plan. The plan, guided by the 
objectives and priorities, will include decisions such as resourcing, incentives, which analytical processes 
to modify, and how to adapt priority business units, products and services, engagement plans, and other 
core business levers.7576
1) COMPONENT: OBJECTIVES AND PRIORITIES
Overview and relevance: Clear net-zero objectives 
along with priority key financing strategies provide 
clarity to internal stakeholders; allow external 
stakeholders to assess the appropriateness of the 
proposed actions against the stated ambition; and 
allow one financial institution’s transition objectives 
to be compared to its peers. 
Guidance: A financial institution should articulate 
its transition objectives and how they will be 
embedded within the wider organization and 
corporate strategy.
Recommendation
Define the organization’s objectives to reach 
net zero by 2050 or sooner, in line with science-
based pathways to limit warming to 1.5 degrees 
C, stating clearly defined and measurable 
interim and long-term targets74 and strategic 
timelines, and identify the priority financing 
strategies75 of net-zero transition action to 
enable real-economy emissions  reduction.

This articulation of objectives and strategy should 
guide the overall transition plan, providing a bridge 
from high-level commitments the financial institution 
has made to the specific changes they will make to 
their business and operations (as discussed in the 
“Implementation Strategy,” “Engagement Strategy,” 
“Metrics and Targets,” and “Governance” sections). 
As such, a financial institution’s objectives and 
priorities should include its interim and long-term 
targets (for which guidance is provided in the 
“Metrics and Targets” section) and should detail 
the institution’s high-level approach for how it is 
planning to achieve them.
A financial institution’s Objectives and priorities 
should reflect its overarching net-zero commitment. 
For members of the financial sector-specific 
alliances comprising GFANZ, this includes, at a 
minimum, their alliance commitment. Objectives 
should include the following  elements:
• Coverage: Net-zero sector-specific alliances may 
allow for staged implementation to net zero or 
options for the extent of activities covered by 
interim targets (e.g., focusing interim targets 
on specific high-emitting sectors). Financial 
institutions should provide the rationale for 
the decisions they have made in these regards. 
Institutions should consider specifying what 
was included in and what was excluded from 
their objectives to facilitate comparisons. 
Given the rapid development of data, tools, and 
methodologies in this space, financial institutions 
should regularly revisit sectors, activities, or 
other elements not included in their current 
transition plans. 
77 In the context of a net-zero transition plan, various years and intervals are specified by the net-zero alliances and industry 
authorities, such as SBTi. Short-term are between five and ten years maximum with mention of 2025 and 2030 as “interim” targets. 
The year 2040 is also used as an interim year. 
78 United Nations, COP26 Together for our planet .
79 GFANZ expects that financial institutions will use various combinations of strategies and tactics to achieve a net-zero transition as 
also acknowledged by SBTi in their description of possible mitigation strategies in their report Foundations for Science-Based Net-
Zero Target Setting in the Financial Sector .
• Timelines: Financial institutions should  
articulate how net-zero transition plan actions  
will be staged, for example over the immediate 
(1 year), short (2–3 years), and medium (by 2030) 
timeframes. Net-zero transition plans should 
consider defining how they expect their longer-
term (by 2050) strategy to evolve from current 
approaches to meet their net-zero target date. 
Plans should include both interim GHG emissions 
targets (2030 or earlier)77 and net-zero targets 
(2050 or earlier targets). 
• Key climate topics: While the transition to 
net zero involves the whole economy, certain 
sectors and activities are central to aligning  
with a low- or no-overshoot 1.5 degrees 
C-aligned pathway. Financial institutions should 
consider articulating how they plan to address 
such topics throughout their transition plans,  
in particular through policies and conditions. 
Two such topics highlighted at COP26 were the 
need to halt and reverse deforestation by 2030 
and the need to transition away from unabated 
fossil fuels.78 
Financial institutions should state how they will 
prioritize different key financing strategies to 
support the real-economy transition to net zero. 79 
Prioritization of key financing strategy(ies) may 
depend on the financial institution’s size, business 
model, levers of influence, operating environment, 
portfolio and client characteristics and emissions 
profiles, and geographic coverage, among other 
factors. The application of the Implementation 
Strategy and Engagement Strategy themes should 
be guided by the prioritized financing strategies.

The key financing strategies (introduced in   
Part B) for financial institutions to support the real-
economy net-zero transition include the following:
• Climate solutions: Financing or enabling entities 
and activities that develop and scale climate  
solutions. This should include financing, investing, 
and related services supporting activities 
such as early-stage climate technologies and 
services to bring them into mainstream; later-
stage climate solutions to scale and increase 
deployment; new infrastructure needed for the 
low-carbon economy; nature-based solutions; 
and understanding and addressing risks 
associated with new zero-carbon activities 
and industries.
• Aligned: Financing or enabling entities that 
are already aligned to a 1.5 degrees C pathway. 
Actions to do so should include shifting portfolio 
allocations and financial services toward real-
economy companies or sectors that are more 
advanced in their transition; developing new 
financial products that focus on such real-
economy companies; and related financial 
services to continue supporting firms well  
on their way to transition. 
80 GFANZ. Guidance on Use of Sectoral Pathways for Financial Institutions , June 2022.
81 GFANZ recognizes that many entities are in the early stages of implementing their net-zero commitment and that it requires time 
to develop a credible net-zero transition plan. The focus of “aligning” is on progress toward full implementation of a net-zero 
transition plan with an urgency on near-term action. GFANZ recognizes there is a gray area where entities may be committed and 
taking significant steps in implementing but are still developing their net-zero transition plan. Disclosure from these entities will be 
essential to assessing progress as detailed in GFANZ’s Expectations for Real-economy Transition Plans , 2022.
82 GFANZ. The Managed Phaseout of High-emitting Assets , June 2022, p. 28-29. Figure  11 in the cited report represents initial 
features that companies of financial institutions may be expected to provide as part of their transition plans in reference to 
managed phaseout.  
• Aligning: Financing or enabling entities 
committed to transitioning in line with 1.5 
degrees C-aligned pathways.  Actions under 
this strategy should detail how the institutions 
identify companies, assets, or projects in early 
stages of transition, beginning to transition, 
and advanced in transitioning. Actions should 
include adapting their product and services 
consistent with this strategy; seeking new clients 
and portfolio companies willing to align their 
business consistent with 1.5 degrees C sectoral 
pathways;80 and integrating use of proceeds 
concept. Institutions should consider defining 
conditions for determining whether net zero-
committed entities who are developing a net-
zero transition plan can be included as “aligning” 
for internal purposes. 81
• Managed phaseout: Financing or enabling  
the accelerated managed phaseout (e.g.,  
early retirement) of high-emitting physical 
assets. Actions under this strategy should 
include levers such as engaging with clients  
and portfolio companies to identify 
opportunities to accelerate the phaseout,  
and developing products and services to 
support an orderly phaseout. 82

Key levers for ﬁnancing approach
We encourage ﬁnancial institutions to apply all components to their organization but recognize emphasis 
on speciﬁc components may be more helpful when considering particular key ﬁnancing strategies.
Foundations, metrics and targets, and governance are equally relevant for all ﬁnancing strategies as they 
are overarching accountability structures.
Special emphasis on the following strategy components may be helpful. Some examples include: Assessing 
a ﬁrm’s transition to net zero may require new analysis in activities and decision making; Focusing ﬁnancial 
services at scaling climate solutions could be covered under products and services; Identifying a physical 
asset for managed phase out may be covered under engagement with portfolio companies.

FOUNDATIONS
Financial institutions should provide a clear 
and structured articulation of the principles, 
assumptions, and context that pertain to their 
transition plans. A statement should be from, or 
endorsed by, an institution’s senior executive, such 
as the Chief Executive Officer, Board Chairperson, 
or someone in an equivalent oversight role. The 
statement should explain: 1) how the institution 
is considering the prioritization of key financing 
strategies listed above and how these will affect 
their GHG emissions, and 2) whether and how 
the net-zero transition will impact the institution’s 
overall business strategy. Where appropriate and 
possible, such statements should be endorsed by 
the Board (or equivalent strategic oversight body). 
Institutions should also consider articulating:
• overarching principles — such as just   
transition or intersection with other  
climate topics (e.g., climate-related  
financial risk, adaptation, and resilience) ;83, 84
• business context — for example, how the 
institution’s size, business units/operating 
models, departments, products, and services 
will affect or contribute to overall net-zero 
objectives; 
• assumptions — transition pathway uncertainties 
and implementation  challenges;
• timing — in addition to near-term GHG emissions 
reduction, objectives that target medium-
term outcomes (within portfolios and the real 
economy); and 
• geographical context — for example, differences 
in policy and regulatory environments, regional 
business activity, other country or region-
specific risks and opportunities.
In describing its objectives and approach, an 
institution should consider providing a high-
level discussion of any sector-specific strategies; 
whether it takes a top-down or bottom-up 
approach;85 whether it will rely on particular

85 A top-down approach refers to decision-making at the highest level or looking at the big picture and filtering down to the 
teams. A bottom-up approach refers to starting with the details and building up to a corporate strategy. For example, PAII’s Net 
Zero Investment Framework (NZIF) approach for setting objectives and targets at the portfolio and asset class levels would be

science-based sectoral pathways; and whether 
it applies exclusions or additional conditions or 
criteria, in line with credible transition scenarios 
or pathways.
BOX 4. JUST TRANSITION AND NATURE  
IN NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLANS
GFANZ believes the transition to a net-zero 
economy should be a just transition and should 
strengthen nature and biodiversity. 
Transition activities, such as replacing high-  
emitting activities with low-emitting alternatives, 
have the potential to disadvantage workers, 
communities, and already marginalized social 
groups. At the same time, transition activities 
can also contribute positively to economic 
opportunity, energy access and affordability, 
and community resilience. 
Transition activities can also have unintended 
negative consequences on nature and 
biodiversity. At the same time, protecting 
nature and biodiversity can play an important 
role in mitigating climate change, and transition 
activities can be pursued in ways that contribute 
positively to nature. 
GFANZ has outlined these important topics  
as areas requiring further work to develop  
pan-sector guidance on how financial 
institutions can integrate them into transition 
plans, discussed in the Financial Institution 
Net-zero Transition Plans — Supplemental 
Information report. In the meantime, financial 
institutions can use existing guidance and 
develop their own understanding and practice 
to factor these topics into the objectives and 
priorities of their net-zero transition plans.

An institution should also articulate whether and 
how it intends to use carbon credits. While primary 
focus is on decarbonization and real-economy 
emissions reduction within the financial institution’s 
value chain, institutions may use carbon removal 
credits to neutralize residual emissions that are 
not feasible to eliminate. Moreover, firms may 
opt to pursue a “high ambition path to net zero” 
and compensate for emissions in addition to 
decarbonization efforts, thus purchasing carbon 
credits as they are working to drive down absolute

emissions. 86 For both these uses, firms should 
articulate their strategy and considerations such 
as type and quality of credits the institution will 
source, the emissions outside the value chain 
that the institution intends to compensate with 
credits, and how credits will be used to neutralize 
residual emissions. Please see the “ Carbon 
credits” section in the Financial Institution Net-
zero Transition Plans — Supplemental Information 
report and “Component: Metrics and targets ” for

FOUNDATIONS
Ultimately, an institution’s net-zero objectives 
and priorities should articulate how the financial 
institution’s strategy aims to align with the net-
zero transition immediately and over the long 
term. Where relevant, a financial institution should 
integrate its objectives and priorities in internal 
policies that govern company strategy; business 
practices; products and services; and other 
core business areas to drive change throughout 
the institution. To support the integration, 
considerations should be embedded into corporate 
financial plans including budgets and internal 
resource allocation decisions. Objectives and 
priorities should be reviewed at regular intervals, 
considering the rapid pace of change of the 
economic, technological, and social  context.

Example 1. Aviva’s Climate Transition Plan defines objectives
Sub-sector: Insurance
Aviva’s first iteration of its Climate Transition Plan,88 launched in March 2022, provides an explicit discussion of  
the company’s objectives, strategy, and priorities. This corresponds closely to the GFANZ recommendations. 
It presents a short ambition statement that clearly specifies the company’s priority areas and scope, and contains  
an accelerated timeframe (i.e., earlier than 2050) compared to its sub-sector alliance commitment. Aviva states:
“We pledge to be a Net Zero company by 2040, abating the carbon emissions we produce ourselves and from 
our suppliers by 2030, from our insurance book by 2040, and from customers’ and shareholders’ investments 
by 2040.”
Footnotes to this statement provide definitions of “corporate net zero” and “asset coverage” for readers interested 
in technical details, and a link to a web page for more information. 
Using a simple timeline, Aviva details its roadmap, including interim climate goals and targets, with the interval 
between the targets shorter in the short term and longer in the long term. This shows that it has considered 
immediate steps while allowing for regular reviews and potential adjustments to be made along the way. Aviva  
is also preparing its science-based targets for submission to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi).

Additionally, the Climate Transition Plan connects Aviva’s objectives to targets and actions. The company explains 
its current and future activities to achieve net zero for Scopes 1, 2, and 3 emissions by 2040; reach net zero in its 
operations by 2030; and increase its sustainable investments. For each objective, Aviva sets out actions and levers 
to implement. It also discusses complementary objectives related to the highest carbon-emitting sectors; supporting 
people as the economy changes (relating to a just transition); the dependencies and impact on biodiversity and 
the influence it can bring to bear on various actors who help shape global economies and financial markets; and 
planning its future carbon-removal offsets (negative emissions).
GFANZ guidance is that financial institutions should articulate how their plan will be embedded within the wider 
organization. Aviva states, “To deliver this plan will require action on our investments and underwriting, which 
between them account for around 90% of our current emissions, alongside how we run and operate our business.” 
The company explains how it will deliver on its pledges, and how it is organizing efforts into five functional streams: 
Investments, Internal Operations, Supply Chain, General Insurance Underwriting, and Claims Management. The plan 
also touches on governance and long-term incentive plans, demonstrating the considerations taken in developing 
the transition plan.
Aviva signals that this is the first release of its plan, and it will refresh and strengthen its plan over time. For the 
sector, Aviva considers that many pieces of the puzzle are still missing: The data is imperfect; methodologies are 
incomplete. These will evolve over time; however, Aviva believed it could no longer wait for everything to be neatly 
laid out before it developed and started to implement a plan.
 
Example 2. Robeco’s ambition and roadmap
Sub-sector: Asset  Management
Robeco, an international asset manager owned by Japan’s ORIX Corporation, produced its Net Zero Roadmap89 
in October 2021, which communicates the company’s commitment and plan. In addition to setting out Robeco’s 
interim targets, the roadmap document contains a clear commitment statement, which includes two of GFANZ’s 
recommended elements: scope and timing. 
“Our commitment: Robeco is committed to achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions across all its assets 
under management by 2050. We commit to this goal because it’s part of our responsible stewardship and because 
we are convinced it’s in the long-term interest of our clients and our investment performance. Our vision is that 
safeguarding economic, environmental and social assets is a prerequisite for a healthy economy and the generation  
of attractive returns in the future.”
An infographic lays out the company’s baseline emissions for investment portfolios and operational emissions 
(2019), interim GHG emissions reduction targets for 2025 and 2030, and key actions to be taken to achieve the 
reductions. 
The document then describes each of the six key actions, articulating how the overall ambition links to the 
implementation of the transition plan.

~40% of assets under management. This is the entire Robeco fund 
range, except for asset classes that cannot be covered due to current 
methodological limitations, such as sovereign bonds, cash and 
derivatives, and the Green Bonds fund for which carbon footprints 
cannot be measured in an adequate way. We are collaborating with 
other investors and standard-setters to develop carbon accounting 
standards for these asset classes.
Note: As part of our net zero roadmap, we will continue to improve our 
methods and data. These improvements mean that our baselines will 
be subject to recalculation, for example when we incorporate scope 3 
emission data, or when we have better data coverage on the alignment of 
companies. Other factors will also prompt recalculation of the baselines, 
such as the effect of market appreciation and the changing composition 
of reference indices. We will follow international standards in any of these 
adjustments. In our disclosures we will be transparent about revisions to 
our baselines and we will disclose both unadjusted and adjusted figures.

This example, in addition to the ambition statement, brings together many of the core components of the GFANZ 
recommendations. The scope is broad (covering all assets under management as well as operations), the timing is 
specific, and the ambition is high (50% reduction by 2030, net zero by 2050). The roadmap includes engagement 
plans, clear actions to reduce emissions from portfolio companies and promote net-zero investments, and reporting 
commitments. The company says its targets and annual progress report will be externally reviewed.

BOX 5. A NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLAN INCLUDING THE MANAGED PHASEOUT OF  
HIGH-EMITTING ASSETS 
The Managed Phaseout approach outlined by GFANZ 90 allows financial institutions to provide asset 
owner-operators clarity that finance for high-emitting assets can be provided, but that it should be 
conditional on plans to cease operation of those assets over a timeframe that is consistent with the 
net-zero transition. The Managed Phaseout approach is an emerging area of transition finance. 
The approach recognizes that some high-emitting assets will need to be operated while no/low-
carbon alternatives are being developed. This can be an equivalent approach to a net-zero GHG 
emissions reduction pathway if the retirement date is 1.5 degrees C-aligned or earlier. The Managed 
Phaseout approach is relevant: to assets that may be viable today but are either at financial risk as 
the global economy decarbonizes or are inconsistent with a 1.5 degrees C-aligned transition in their 
current operations; and where assets cannot be redeveloped or retrofitted and so need to be retired 
over a suitable timeframe.
Figure 13 shows the illustrative GHG emissions profiles for a single asset and a portfolio of assets. For 
a single asset, a possible 1.5 degrees C-aligned GHG emissions profile could be for GHG emissions 
to remain largely constant and then stop completely upon closure (left graph). The latest retirement 
point would need to be calibrated to be aligned with a 1.5 degrees C pathway. A company operating 
several high-emitting assets could potentially retire them at different times (right graph).

a 1.5 degrees C-aligned retirement date is set 91

THEME
Implementation Strategy
A financial institution's core business activities and decision-making processes are integral to translating 
its transition objectives and priorities into concrete goals and desired outcomes for business teams. The 
Implementation Strategy recommendations focus on the products and services that are key to allocating 
and securing capital for emissions reduction in the real economy; the internal analytics and processes that 
drive financing activity; and policies for financing climate-critical  activities.
1) COMPONENT: PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
Recommendation
Use existing and new products and services 
to support and increase clients’ and portfolio 
companies’ efforts to transition in line with 
1.5 degrees C net-zero pathways. Include 
accelerating and scaling the net-zero transition 
in the real economy, providing transition-
related education and advice, and supporting 
portfolio decarbonization in accordance with 
the institution's net-zero transition strategy.
 
Overview and relevance: Through its products 
and services, a financial institution can facilitate 
and accelerate GHG emissions reduction; signal 
to the real economy that transition strategies will 
be supported with capital or insurance coverage; 
and educate clients, portfolio companies, and 
broader society on the need for the net-zero 
transition. To this end, financial institutions ' finance 
and investment vehicles, insurance products, and 
financial services can be aligned with the financial 
institution’s and their clients’ net-zero objectives.
 
92 An example of a new product that covers this type of investment is the European Investment Bank’s Venture Debt to fill the 
financing market gap faced by high-growth, innovation-focused companies.
Guidance: Financial institutions should assess 
whether and how their existing products and 
services support and de-risk the net-zero transition, 
whether and how they could be modified to do so, 
and whether new “climate-aligned” products and 
services are required. Where relevant (depending 
on the institution’s business model), ensure that the 
suite of products and services sufficiently supports 
real-economy decarbonization and acceleration of 
climate solutions.92 Products and services can be 
geared to do the following:
• Provide financing, investment, insurance, or other 
services that support companies and activities 
developing climate solutions or enabling 
the net-zero transition (e.g., financing that is 
conditional on phaseout of high-emitting assets 
or partnerships with government to share risks 
across the value chain; insurers could develop/
offer insurance and reinsurance products and 
solutions for low-emissions and zero-emissions 
technologies that enable capital flows). 
• Reduce portfolio or financed GHG emissions in 
alignment with a recognized decarbonization 
pathway, or construct a portfolio that is geared  
 
 
 
 
 
CONTENTS  |  FINANCIAL INSTITUTION NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLANS — FUNDAMENTALS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND GUIDANCE
40
toward assets that have a clear transition 
plan in place (e.g., indices or funds based on 
transition-aligned pathways, Outsourced Chief 
Investment Officer (OCIO) services that include 
transition considerations).
• Educate and advise clients and counterparties 
on the net-zero transition. Examples include 
educating small- and medium-sized businesses 
on transition risks; educating clients on trade-
offs, such as pursuing a low GHG footprint 
versus an overweight allocation to a low-
emissions fund; insurance brokers could engage 
with clients to help them take steps toward 
reducing their GHG emissions to be allowed 
to purchase a specific insurance policy; and 
pension funds could educate their beneficiaries 
on net zero-related considerations. 
93 GFANZ. Guidance on Use of Sectoral Pathways for Financial Institutions , 2022, and anticipated further work on sector-
specific pathways.
Because products and services are highly 
specific to different financial institutions and 
may span multiple business lines, an institution 
should focus on products and services within 
its major areas of business (i.e., where it has 
significant influence, a large network, or greatest 
potential for decarbonization or real-economy 
transition acceleration).
When designing products and services, financial 
institutions should consider a few key aspects 
to ensure suitable alignment with 1.5 degrees C 
pathways and the institution’s net-zero objectives 
and targets, as well as effective deployment. 
The key aspects that form the conditions 
around the business relationship should be 
clearly communicated.
Table 2. Aspects of net-zero product design
KEY ASPECT CONSIDERATIONS
Real-economy  impact Will the product or service support and/or create incentives for the client or portfolio 
company to decarbonize in a meaningful way, in addition to meeting the financial 
institution’s own net-zero targets?
Transparency and  integrity Is the purpose of the product or service clear and transparent? Is it labeled clearly, 
tied to an industry standard, and/or verified by a third-party audit (if relevant) to avoid 
potential greenwashing  claims?
Data availability Are there sufficient datasets or proxies available to build the product or service, and to 
measure the impact of the product or service if it is offered?
Scale Is the product or service commercially viable to allow it to scale? Is the product 
or service measured against specific performance indicators to ensure it is being 
provided at a meaningful  scale?
Acceleration Is the product or service geared toward accelerating climate solutions or the transition 
in hard-to-abate sectors in line with 1.5 degrees C scenarios or sectoral pathways? 93 
Methodology Is there freedom in the net-zero product design process to allow for creativity 
and innovation?

97 Inside EVs. Volkswagen contracts a line of credit linked to an ESG commitment , February 5, 2022.
98 Bradesco. Climate Change Management at Bradesco , June 2022.
In 2020, Banco Bradesco S.A. structured the first green export credit note in the Brazilian market. 94
Bradesco worked with Companhia Brasileira de Aluminio (CBA), a vertically integrated aluminum company, on a 
BRL 250 million credit note — a loan to exporting clients — to support CBA to reduce the carbon footprint of its 
aluminum production.  
Loan proceeds are targeted toward CBA projects that improve environmental indicators involving, among other 
benefits, the reduction in the carbon emissions per ton of aluminum produced. The use of proceeds will adhere to 
the criteria of CBA’s Green Financing Framework,95 which was developed with technical assistance from Bradesco. 
The aluminum company’s framework received a second-party opinion from SITAWI96 that indicates capital raised will 
be allocated to projects and assets with a positive environmental impact, aligned with international best practices 
(Green Bond Principles, Green Loan Principles, and United Nations Sustainable Development Goals [UN SDGs]).
The green export credit note to CBA was Bradesco 's first ESG-labeled operation and shows how its investment 
bank unit is engaging with, and financing, clients in the transition to a low-carbon economy, consistent with 
GFANZ recommendations. Bradesco is working to develop further customized solutions to help corporate clients 
achieve their objectives and environmental goals through loan operations as well as in the capital markets. 
Similarly, Bradesco supported Volkswagen with a BRL 500 million green export credit note, which ensures that 
the vehicle manufacturer is committed to reduce its Scope 1 GHG emissions by 12% by replacing 20% of natural 
gas consumption with biomethane by 2024, and achieve 25.6% of women in leadership positions, ensuring at least 
24.8% of women in management and executive management positions, by 2024. 97 
As for other net zero-supportive products and services, Bradesco is one of Brazil’s main financial agents for 
renewable energy projects (in 2020, it advised on 15 operations focused on generation, transmission, and 
distribution of energy from renewable sources). It also participates in a program offering loans with special 
interest rates for farmers to remediate pastureland and forests and adopt farming technologies that help reduce 
GHG emissions, and it offers a direct-to-customer loan product for solar power equipment. 98

Example 4. HSBC’s support for client decarbonization
Sub-sector: Banking and Asset  Management
99 HSBC Holdings plc. Annual Report and Accounts 2021 , February 2022.
100 HSBC defines “sustainable finance and investment” as any form of financial service that integrates ESG criteria into business or 
investment decisions; and financing, investing, and advisory activities that support the achievement of UN SDGs, including but not 
limited to the aims of the Paris Agreement on climate change. The SDGs, also known as the Global Goals, were adopted by all UN 
member states in 2015 as a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that all people enjoy peace and 
prosperity by 2030, according to its 2021 annual report and  accounts .
101 The breakdown of HSBC’s sustainable finance and investment progress is included in its ESG Datapack . The detailed definitions of 
the contributing activities for sustainable finance are available in the revised Sustainable Finance and Investment Data Dictionary, 
2021. Please refer to their ESG Datapack, Sustainable Finance and Investment Data Dictionary, and PwC Assurance Report.

104 HSBC Holdings plc. Annual Report and Accounts 2021 , February 2022.
HSBC aims to support its customers on their net-zero transition and works with clients in different sectors on 
their sustainability and GHG emissions reduction goals. 99 This corresponds to the GFANZ recommendation to 
develop products and services that will accelerate and scale the net-zero transition in the real economy and 
support portfolio decarbonization. To do this, HSBC provides clients with a range of products and services aligned 
to the transition, while contributing to its own net-zero targets. Relatedly, these initiatives contribute to HSBC’s 
sustainable finance and investment 100 target of between $750 billion and $1 trillion by 2030. 101 In 2021, HSBC:
• organized two large-scale, aviation sector sustainability-linked loans:
 – Etihad airline company raised $1.2 billion, with targets including emissions reduction for the passenger fleet, 
with financial penalties and incentives of up to $5.5 million.
 – British Airways plc raised £1 billion linked to aircraft fuel efficiency.
• attracted international and domestic investors when Greece-based Public Power Corporation issued a €650 
million high-yield sustainability-linked bond, committing the company to reduce its carbon emissions, or face 
higher financing costs;  
• launched HSBC Pollination Climate Asset Management  to establish natural capital funds to address nature-
related issues and climate change, for both emerging and developed markets ;102 
• launched a £500 million Green SME Fund to support businesses in the transition to a low-carbon economy, 
outlining criteria for green activities across a range of sub-categories ;103 and
• introduced green mortgages for customers in the UAE and Singapore to finance the purchase of homes 
accredited as energy efficient. 104

Moody’s Corporation, an integrated risk assessment firm, is committed to achieving net-zero emissions across 
its operations and value chain by 2040. Moody’s views the delivery of new products and services, research and 
development, and innovation as crucial pillars of its net-zero strategy. The company describes its role in the race 
to net zero as bringing clarity to the complex and interrelated macroeconomic, financial, and social impacts of 
climate change. 105 
It organizes its climate-related products and services into two broad offerings:
1. New solutions to support customers in understanding portfolio alignment and climate risk
In 2021, Moody’s launched Climate Solutions,106 a product suite dedicated to the identification, quantification, 
monitoring, and integration of climate risk into financial decision-making. For example, Temperature Alignment Data 
assesses how individual companies’ emissions targets align with global temperature benchmarks.107 This product 
allows users to assess the forward-looking trajectory of companies’ emissions based on GHG emissions reduction 
targets.108 Using this information, banks and asset managers can monitor the net-zero alignment of their portfolios, 
benchmarking their emissions targets against peer targets.
Other products in the Climate Solutions product suite include CreditLens™, which aims to enable lenders to assess 
and integrate the impact of climate on a customer’s credit quality, as part of existing credit origination processes; 
and Supply Chain Catalyst, which aims to enable the assessment of climate risk throughout the supply chain.
2. Embedding climate analysis into credit ratings
In 2021, Moody’s Investors Service (MIS) provided greater transparency into how ESG and climate considerations 
are integrated into its credit ratings by embedding ESG Issuer Profile Scores (including carbon transition scores) 
and Credit Impact Scores into credit ratings.109 MIS also provides detailed Carbon Transition Assessments for rated 
companies in sectors that are most exposed to these risks.110

114 Nationwide Building Society. Climate-related Financial Disclosures 2022 , 2022.
According to Nationwide Building Society, a mutual owned by its 16.3 million members, the 29 million homes in 
the UK account for 16% of the country’s total carbon emissions. 111 Reducing these emissions and addressing the 
barriers to retrofit is a cross-industry challenge. 
For its part, Nationwide has developed new green products and services focused on home energy efficiency to help 
reach its commitment to net zero by 2050. By offering innovative financing programs, it aims to improve the energy 
performance certificate (EPC) ratings of its mortgage portfolio such that by 2030, at least 50% of homes on its 
mortgage book will be EPC C or better. Nationwide has launched propositions across three key real estate markets:
 1. Purchasing of new energy-efficient  homes
2. Retrofitting for homeowners
3. Retrofitting for landlords
 
In 2020–21, Nationwide: 112, 113, 114
• launched a Green Additional Borrowing mortgage product to its members to help make energy-efficient 
home improvements;
• partnered with Switchd to offer its members and colleagues a free six-month trial of their auto-energy tariff 
switching service, which includes green options;
• launched a solar panel pilot program with MakeMyHouseGreen, aiming to help 300 customers install solar 
panels on their homes;
• contacted approximately 70,000 The Mortgage Works customers (around 33% of Nationwide’s buy-to-let book) 
who did not appear to have a valid EPC, with the aim to remind them of the regulation and educate them about 
energy efficiency;
• progressed its Oakfield development in Swindon, consisting of 239 homes built to high environmental 
standards, which it hopes will provide a blueprint for future sustainable homes;
• launched the Green Reward Mortgage product to members, offering cash back for properties with an EPC  
of A or high B; and 
• launched the Green Further Advance Mortgage to The Mortgage Works customers to help them make energy-
efficient home  improvements.

Through its products and services, Nationwide is attempting to accelerate the net-zero transition in the real 
economy and is providing transition-related education and advice to retail customers, consistent with  
GFANZ recommendations.  
Nationwide notes, however, that public policy changes are also required if it is to meet its net-zero objectives. 
Government policies and regulations promoting high energy-efficiency standards for new homes and retrofit 
incentives for homeowners and occupiers to cut their carbon emissions are considered particularly important 
for reaching a net-zero economy.115 Nationwide has introduced its products to cater to the increase in demand 
expected as policies and regulations are  introduced.

CONTENTS  |  FINANCIAL INSTITUTION NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLANS — FUNDAMENTALS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND GUIDANCE
46
Overview and relevance: Financial institutions 
use analytical tools and review processes to 
evaluate and inform decisions on all financing 
activities, including risk-return ratios in investments, 
underwriting, lending, approving new clients, and 
more. These tools and processes form the core 
business operations, and most do not account 
for transition objectives. If institutions are to align 
business activities with net-zero commitments, 
then they should integrate net-zero data, targets, 
and objectives into these evaluation and decision-
making tools and processes.  
Guidance: The integration should be guided by 
any specific net-zero objective or target for that 
business and mindful of sector-specific priority 
transition activities. Where there is no specific 
objective or target, processes should still align with 
the institution’s net-zero ambition. Core decision-
making processes vary across the financial sector, 
and may involve the following:
116 Examples include the Green Bond Principles, Green Loan Principles, and the work of the Climate Bonds Initiative.
• transaction approvals
• lending approvals
• investment mandate allocations
• direct investment allocations
• credit underwriting
• insurance underwriting
• client and/or investment due diligence
Criteria used in decision-making should reflect 
any conditions laid out in policies. Where possible, 
consider adjustments that integrate transition-
relevant data, information, and implications into the 
detailed analytical processes, statements, terms 
of reference, or procedures that underpin the core 
decision-making processes. For instance,  by:
• adjusting factors in risk models and expected 
return models, such as discount rate or credit 
quality/ratings, based on a view of the transition;
• adding transition-related diligence questions to 
committee processes or reviews of third parties, 
such as asset managers, OCIOs, investment 
consultants, and subject matter  experts;
• utilizing a recognized framework116 to assess the 
plan for sustainability-linked finance; and
• incorporating client and portfolio company 
transition plans/progress; third-party 
assessments of client/portfolio company 
actions; sector decarbonization pathways; and 
emissions mitigation technology uptake in 
the market.
Recommendation
Embed the financial institution’s net-zero 
objectives and priorities in its core evaluation 
and decision-making tools and processes to 
support its net-zero commitment. This applies 
to both top-down/oversight structures and 
bottom-up tools and actions.

Financial institutions should consider adjusting the top-down tools that inform their core decision-making 
processes. For example, such adjustments could include using the following:
• taxonomy-based ratios (e.g., green asset ratio, sustainable asset  ratio)
• internal carbon pricing
• green capital weighting
• carbon budgets
• assigned changes to asset ratings based on transition  readiness
• internal thresholds aligned to financed emissions interim targets

Following its pledge to a two-step process to divest from fossil fuels (reduce exposure to coal and tar 
sands, and analysis of exposure to other fossil fuel investments), as of March 31, 2022, RBF’s exposure 
to coal and tar sands has been reduced to 0.05% of their total portfolio. (At the time of RBF’s first 
comprehensive analysis of its exposure in April 2014, it was 1.6%.) The fund’s total fossil fuel exposure  
is estimated to be 0.3% (in April 2014, it was 6.6%). 120

Natixis Corporate and Investment Banking (CIB), a subsidiary of the French banking group Groupe BPCE, has 
developed a dedicated tool to support climate-related decision-making. Groupe BPCE is gradually extending this 
work to cover all its lending portfolios (excluding the financial sector and sovereign issuers).
The Green Weighting Factor (GWF) tool assigns a climate rating to assets, financed products, or borrowers. It is 
a seven-level color rating resulting from an assessment of the climate impact of the transaction, incorporating 
environmental externalities. The bank assesses indicators on water, biodiversity, waste, and air pollution, 
though the weighting of each metric depends on the sector or project. This proprietary tool enables systematic 
integration of climate change in CIB financing activities and is described in the Groupe BPCE 2021 TCFD Report. 121 
A GWF rating is assigned whenever credit is granted, and the rating is reviewed regularly. Natixis CIB uses the 
GWF tool to measure and steer its share of balance sheet assets that are most exposed to transition risk. All 
“green” financing is assigned a reduction in analytical risk-weighted assets of up to 50% for the greenest. This 
metric is increased by up to 24%, however, for financing that has a negative impact on the climate. By adjusting 
the expected return on each loan according to its environmental and climate impact, teams are encouraged to 
favor green financing solutions (for an equivalent level of credit risk). The tool was also used in the decision to exit 
client relationships that had no potential to become aligned with net-zero objectives. 122 
The tool has been in use for more than two years, and ratings fluctuate as both the methodology and client 
disclosure evolve. While it took time to fully implement and train employees, the GWF is now fully deployed and 
targets have been set for every CIB line of business. Senior management emphasizes the importance of the GWF, 
which has also been integrated into CIB’s Risk Appetite Framework.

METRICS & TARGETS
Groupe BPCE is now in a position to measure the carbon 
intensity of its portfolios potentially having the most sig-
nificant climate impact and to manage their alignment 
with a Net Zero trajectory. The Green Evaluation Models 
approach, which broadens the scope of these measures 
to the portfolios of the retail banks, will be rolled out for 
all its financing portfolios by 2024. 
The Group uses these ratings and measurements of global 
warming trajectories to:
• Engage a strategic dialogue with customers and struc-
ture the sustainable financial products resulting from 
this dialogue, 
• Manage the portfolios in an active manner,
• Implement a strategic business planning system in line 
with its commitments including – as far as the customer 
ranking is concerned – the definition of priorities and iden-
tification of sustainable financing opportunities,
• Steer the portfolios into alignment with a 1.5°C trajectory.

ation. One of the major challenges of the envi-
ronmental transition is to articulate a long-term 
strategic vision with execution in the short term. 
The Green Weighting Factor successfully com-
bines the two by assessing the climate impact 
and climate transition risk of each financing op-
eration and thereby enabling us to adopt clear 
and precise commitments over the long term.”

As well, in the context of Groupe BPCE’s 2024 strategic plan, the GWF has supported the ongoing measurement 
of climate impact and activity-specific target setting for each business line, sector, and geography using two main 
indicators: 1) the mix of GWF ratings and 2) the bank balance sheet temperature trajectory. Groupe BPCE will use 
the tool for its retail activities to rate customers and their maturity in terms of addressing the climate-related and 
environmental challenges of their  sector.
The GWF tool is an example of how a major financial institution can embed its net-zero objectives and priorities 
into its core evaluation and decision-making processes.

Example 8. How WTW helps clients make key climate decisions
Sub-sector: Investment  Consultant
WTW is a global investment consultant. Investment consultants can play a vital role in supporting the net-zero 
transition, acting as a critical link between asset managers and asset owners. Across the services provided, 
investment consultants can integrate climate-related criteria into their clients’ decision-making processes.  
For asset owners, they can provide strategic advice on investment criteria, asset allocation, and asset manager 
selection, helping them to make decisions that align with their own net-zero commitments. And for asset 
managers, they can provide guidance on climate solutions and capabilities, encouraging them, through their  
rating process, to incorporate net-zero considerations. 
Since making its net-zero commitment in 2021, WTW has already embedded key climate-related considerations 
within its two main types of services: 124
1. Fiduciary (outsourced) investment  services 
To achieve its net-zero objective,125 WTW uses multiple levers to decarbonize the existing assets in its fiduciary 
portfolios, including changes to risk management and asset allocation, manager selection, index design, 
stewardship, and policy-level engagement. Additionally, it makes new investments in climate solutions, such as 
sustainable agriculture, forestry, and renewable energy.  
2. Advisory investment services  
WTW helps its clients make decisions about the risks and opportunities of climate change through a range of 
advisory services, including helping clients develop climate beliefs, asset allocation, benchmarking, climate scenario 
analysis, net-zero considerations in manager selection and reporting, plus identifying new climate solutions.

WTW uses its net-zero reporting framework, which includes Carbon Journey Planning and a Climate Dashboard 
across both services. 126 The Carbon Journey Planning 127 sets out a pathway of emissions and an annual carbon 
budget for investment portfolios that is consistent with the net-zero transition. Carbon Journey Planning has 
been designed to feed into asset owners’ decision-making when changing asset allocation or awarding new 
asset management mandates. The Climate Dashboard was inspired by the Climate Financial Risk Forum’s data 
and metrics guidance. 128 It incorporates data and metrics across five themes: transition risk, physical risk, carbon 
footprint, alignment, and climate solutions. It is also supplemented by the reporting of engagement activities. The 
Climate Dashboard has been designed to support WTW’s clients in their decisions on asset allocation, manager 
selection, and performance monitoring, and in helping clients achieve their net-zero commitments.

Example 9. Railpen’s Climate Risk and Net Zero Alignment (CRIANZA) framework and tool 
for decision-making
Sub-sector: Asset  Management
Railway Pension Investments Limited (Railpen) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Railways Pension Trustee Company 
Limited, the corporate trustee of the UK’s railway pension schemes (the Trustee). Railpen oversees the day-to-day 
operation of the railway pension schemes and is the investment manager for the schemes.
In 2021, a new Risk Governance Framework was introduced, and Railpen also updated its Investment Beliefs 
to explicitly reference climate change. Railpen incorporates assessment of climate risk and net-zero alignment 
into investment decisions using CRIANZA (Climate Risk And Net Zero Alignment), a proprietary framework and 
developed in-house. CRIANZA, a bottom-up portfolio assessment tool, is used to assess individual companies on 
their climate risk and net-zero alignment. 
CRIANZA is currently used to assess the key emitters contributing to 70% of Railpen’s financed emissions in material 
sectors in listed equities ,129 but it has been designed to be applied across asset classes and to analyze sponsoring 
employers in the future. 130 It incorporates sector-specific features and can be used for risk management, regulatory 
reporting, and to identify gaps in a company’s practice, informing discussions and engagement. 
For each company, CRIANZA produces a risk score (ranging from 1 [low] to 5 [high] risk) and a net-zero alignment 
status (Not Aligned, Committed, Aligning, or Fully Aligned). The alignment scores are determined using a 
milestone-based approach also outlined in the IIGCC Net Zero Stewardship Toolkit 131 to assess and score a 
company’s alignment with a net-zero pathway. The objective of the portfolio alignment assessment is “to enable a 
feedback loop between company analysis and company engagement.” 132

The assessment criteria are shown in the figure below. 133 They feature many of the net-zero transition plan 
components and considerations set out by GFANZ in this document.
Figure 15. CRIANZA’s Net Zero Alignment Assessment Criteria
As part of the 2021 net-zero plan, Railpen Trustees have set a target that, by 2040, 100% of AUM in material 
sectors should be “aligning” or “fully aligned.” In 2021, based on the analysis of 70% of financed emissions, 
which is 10% of overall AUM, 1% of AUM in material sectors fell into these categories. Progressing this further, the 
CRIANZA assessment can be carried out on all holdings in material sectors and may result in the percentage in 
“aligning” or “fully aligned” companies to potentially be higher. The CRIANZA assessment criteria will influence 
future decision-making and engagement.  
Railpen also uses the CRIANZA framework to assess companies for purposes of its Net Zero Engagement Plan 
(NZEP).134 The NZEP uses a four-step approach of prioritization, analysis, engagement and voting, and reporting  
of decarbonization impact on portfolio companies.

The objective of the portfolio alignment assessment is 
to enable a feedback loop between company analysis 
and company engagement. I.e. the insights from 
the analysis feeds into climate stewardship, which 
ultimately should improve company alignment over 
time. The Trustee has adopted a target to increase the 
proportion of portfolio companies rated as “aligning” 
and “fully aligned” (see section 6). The CRIANZA 
framework and tool uses sector and asset class specific 
analysis in its scoring thereby providing a consistent 
data and metrics means that enable the Trustee to 
measure and track progress against this target.
5.4.4.3 Climate Risk Integration in Private 
Markets and Property
Private markets represented c11% of Scheme assets at 
December 2021. Private markets investors are beset by 
a lower level of climate-related information compared 
to public markets. In addition, private markets have 
been a little slower to develop net zero methodologies. 
Railpen has sought to work with industry peers to 
develop a private markets methodology for net zero 
and to that end Railpen has been an active member 
of the Paris Aligned Investing Initiative’s Private Equity 
Working Group, whose draft methodology was 
published in February 2022. 
Our investments in real assets consist mainly of 
property and infrastructure assets located in the UK. 
The portfolio is therefore impacted by trends in UK 
climate data. The UK climate data indicate that there 
has been, and will continue to be, a shift to a warmer 
climate. The most recent assessment from the UK 
Government and the Climate Change Committee 
(CCC) indicates strong evidence that even under low 
warming scenarios, the UK will be subject to a range of 
significant and costly impacts unless significant further 
policy action is taken in the near-term. 
Real assets can be particularly vulnerable to physical 
climate risks. These risks can be event-driven and 
acute, like heatwaves, bushfires or floods, or longer-
term shifts such as rising sea levels or an increase in 
major weather events. Financial implications include 
direct damage to assets, business disruption and 
indirect impacts from supply chain disruption. Real 
assets can also be vulnerable to transition climate 
risks, for example if increasingly stringent climate 
policy measures affect an asset’s ability to generate 
income, or requires unanticipated capital expenditure. 
Railpen, acting for the Trustee, takes a number of risk 
management activities to reduce, mitigate, or exploit 
physical and transition risks within real assets investing. 
Figure 5.4.4.3.1 outlines some of these activities in 
the Property portfolio (c£2bn Scheme assets at 
December 2021).

IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY
Overview and relevance: Policies and conditions 
can be used to manage a financial institution’s 
interaction with high-emitting activities and 
physical assets; to transition those assets to a 
net-zero pathway; and to speed the real-economy 
transition to net zero. Assets and activities might 
be emissions-intensive in and of themselves 
or contribute to increased GHG emissions 
downstream. Policies and conditions set out a 
clear management process for priority areas and 
communicate the organization’s intentions both 
internally and externally.
Guidance: Financial institutions should develop and 
implement policies and conditions that are clear 
and comprehensive and that support the realization 
of the institution’s net-zero transition plan. 
Policies and conditions should apply to high-
emitting sectors and activities, such as thermal

coal and oil and gas, and harmful activities such 
as deforestation, if relevant to the institution’s 
business. These sectors have been highlighted 
because of their contribution to GHG emissions. 
Their importance in achieving GHG emissions 
reductions places them at risk of greater business 
disruption as a result of climate risk and potential 
government action leading to firm-specific transition 
risk and potential for stranded assets. Coal power 
plants produce one-fifth of global GHG emissions.135 
Scopes 1, 2, and 3 emissions from the oil and gas 
sector represent between 33% and 40% of global 
GHG emissions.136 Bodies such as the IEA and IPCC 
agree that the rapid shift away from fossil fuels 
is critical to achieving net zero, with widely used 
pathways projecting a significant decline in the use 
of coal, oil, and gas through 2050.137 
Halting deforestation is a priority because forests 
absorb vast amounts of carbon dioxide and forest 
loss both eliminates carbon sinks and contributes 
directly to GHG emissions. 138 Approximately 22% of 
the world’s emissions stem from land-use activity, 
including logging, deforestation, and farming, 
and half of that from deforestation. 139 Agreements 
related to phasing out coal and methane and 
halting deforestation were spotlighted at COP26 
and the Glasgow Climate Pact included a specific 
focus on fossil fuels, non-CO₂ gases, and nature  
and ecosystems.140, 141
Recommendation
Establish and apply policies and conditions on 
priority sectors and activities, such as thermal 
coal, oil and gas, and deforestation. Include 
other sectors and activities that are high-
emitting, or otherwise harmful to the climate, 
to define business boundaries in line with the 
institution’s net-zero objectives and priorities.
3) COMPONENT: POLICIES AND CONDITIONS
CONTENTS  |  FINANCIAL INSTITUTION NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLANS — FUNDAMENTALS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND GUIDANCE
53
Beyond the priority areas listed previously, financial 
institutions should consider implementing policies 
to cover other issues related to the net-zero 
transition, including methane and biodiversity, 
where they are relevant to their organization.
Policies should be anchored in science-based 
transition scenarios and pathways used to set the 
organization’s net-zero targets, and should reflect 
the strategy taken by the institution to support 
decarbonization in the real economy. Policies 
may also draw from sectoral decarbonization 
pathways, where available, to ground the 
conditions in a robust, credible methodology 142  
and best available information on how to manage   
an orderly phaseout. 143 
Policies and conditions should be regularly 
reviewed and updated. This should include 
evaluating progress against policy timelines and 
objectives, reflecting updates in data availability, 
and considering scientific understanding.

In their policies, institutions should consider 
including a clear objective connected to net zero; 
a definition of the sectors and activities to which 
the policy applies; conditions and standards for 
ongoing business engagement; details of any 
restrictions or exclusions that apply; and relevant 
timelines. As well, the policy should be transparent. 
Table 4 sets out the potential policy elements 
and a description of examples of what they might 
include. If companies are unable or unwilling to 
meet the conditions and standards after suitable 
engagement, financial institutions should consider 
having an escalation process.

conditions in the financial sector.
Table 4. Elements in policies on emissions-intensive assets/activities — Considerations
ELEMENT DESCRIPTION
Objective The overarching goal of the policy, how it supports implementation of the institution’s net-zero 
transition ambition and priorities, and how it is informed by science. 
Scope The type of company, asset, project, and/or activity, as well as the consideration across the 
supply chain, to which the policy applies. Examples include companies whose share of revenue 
generated by specific activity (e.g., coal-fired power) exceed a threshold, a list of specific project 
types (e.g., gas pipelines), or geographies (e.g., the Amazon Basin).
Scope could include the types of business activities within the financial institution (e.g., lending, 
underwriting, investing, advising, services) to which the policy applies, with the aim to cover the 
whole business where feasible over  time.
Conditions Criteria or conditions consistent with a science-based net-zero transition and under which 
the financial institution provides products and services within the activities, geographies, and 
sectors/business areas defined in the policy. For instance, the institution’s policy could require 
more extensive due diligence on particular clients or portfolio companies, or a transition or 
managed phaseout plan. 144 Engagement programs may focus on influencing companies to 
decarbonize operations.

ELEMENT DESCRIPTION
Exclusions Specific prohibited companies, assets, projects, and/or activities that cannot be served or 
financed by the financial institution upon conditions not being met.
Examples include the prohibition of services or financing to entities in scope that do not have 
mitigation plans or whose activities involve expansion of high-emitting sources. Any exclusions 
which a financial institution chooses to apply should be informed by science-based pathways and 
determined unilaterally.
Timelines A roadmap for the transition to net zero in the context of the policy, outlining when and under 
what circumstances the new and existing conditions and exclusions will apply. These timelines 
should be consistent with the science-based pathways used to set net-zero targets.
Transparency Disclosure of methodology used within the policy, metrics used to demonstrate compliance,  
and/or progress, and the governance and review process associated with the policy. Additionally, 
financial institutions should disclose the policies’ scope and percentage coverage of the portfolio 
or otherwise, and any changes to the scope or coverage change.

Credit Agricole: “For the continuation of financial services from 2021, the Bank expects its 
clients to develop and communicate to it an [sic] phasing out plan in line with the timetable 
recommended by climate science (2030 for EU and OECD countries and 2040 for the rest of the 
world), including a commitment not to develop new projects.” 154 
IA ICAPs: “A clear position should be developed on engaging high emitting investments 
(including adopting a formal fossil fuel policy), consistent with any climate pledges made. [ …] 
investors should adopt a robust and science-based policy for the organization in relation to fossil 
fuel phaseout. This policy may also recognize the need for a just transition in countries or regions 
where there is significant dependence on thermal coal power or mining and reflect regional 
differences in speed of phaseout consistent with 1.5 degree C scenarios.” 155

Sub-sector: Asset  Management
Legal and General Investment Management (LGIM), one of the world’s largest asset managers, has set a 2030 
target for 70% of its eligible investments to be managed in line with achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 
2050.177 Where possible, LGIM has implemented its policies and conditions with features including: 
• a clear objective connected to net zero;  
• definition of the sectors and activities to which the policy applies; 
• details of any restrictions or exclusions that apply;
• relevant timelines;  and
• transparency.
Launched in 2016, the Climate Impact Pledge 178 is LGIM’s targeted campaign to address the issue of climate 
change. Since 2020, LGIM has expanded its assessment 179 to include around 1,000 companies in 15 climate-critical 
sectors, responsible for more than half of GHG emissions from the world’s largest publicly listed companies.

A key pillar in the assessment framework is scenario analysis, which includes the comparison of a company’s 
emissions reduction efforts against the sectoral pathways necessary to be in line with the Paris Agreement. Under 
the Pledge, those targeted companies that are not meeting LGIM’s minimum expectations around climate change 
may face a voting sanction. In other words, LGIM, on behalf of its clients, may vote against these companies, if 
appropriate, or ultimately, remove them from selected funds. 180 
More broadly, LGIM’s commitments include a specific policy related to thermal coal and oil sands 181 as well as 
commitments to address agricultural deforestation and work with clients to set decarbonization goals and develop 
investment solutions to support  them.

THEME
Engagement Strategy
Given their roles as trusted providers of capital, insurance, and other financial services, or as owners of 
companies, institutions in the financial sector can support the transition to net zero by engaging with a 
wide range of stakeholders. There are three main engagement approaches financial institutions can use  
to help implement net-zero ambitions, strategies, and targets: 
• Engage with clients and portfolio companies.
• Engage with financial sector peers and industry associations.
• Engage with governments and the public sector.
Recommendation
Proactively and constructively provide 
feedback and support to clients and portfolio 
companies to encourage net zero-aligned 
transition strategies, plans, and progress with 
an escalation framework with consequences 
when engagement is  ineffective.
 
Overview and relevance: Financial institutions can 
play a significant role in supporting and advising 
clients and portfolio companies on their approach 
the transition to net zero. Different types of 
institutions have different capabilities and client 
mixes, and the nature of engagement, therefore, 
varies broadly. 
Guidance: Financial institutions should develop an 
engagement strategy that supports their overall 
net-zero strategy consistent with their commitment. 
The strategy should be tailored to the institution’s 
business model, as well as the needs and context 
of specific clients or portfolio companies and the 
relationship between the financial institution and 
the company. Financial institutions should review 
existing client and portfolio company engagement 
to ensure that efforts are consistent with the nature 
of their net-zero objectives or transition strategy, 
and work to bring existing efforts in line with their 
net-zero engagement strategy.
The engagement strategy should include the 
following characteristics:
• Clear objectives: the desired behaviors, 
requests, or results from clients or portfolio 
companies (including implementing a net-zero 
transition plan).
• Timing of engagement:  length of engagement, 
deadlines, and milestones to indicate progress.
• Coverage: extent of engagement over client 
and company portfolios (e.g., as a percentage 
of the portfolio) and how to prioritize if 
100% engagement has not been reached 
(e.g., by greatest potential influence or 
highest emissions).
• Method of engagement:  including meetings, 
letters, conferences, educational material, and  
other forms of engagement selected based 
on engagement target and relationship (e.g., 
equity ownership, debt holder, client) and other 
considerations including levers available to the 
financial institution (e.g., side letters, insurance 
contracts) or length of time of the relationship 
or influence.
1) COMPONENT: CLIENTS AND PORTFOLIO COMPANIES 
CONTENTS  |  FINANCIAL INSTITUTION NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLANS — FUNDAMENTALS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND GUIDANCE
62
Engagement in support of net-zero objectives 
requires a baseline understanding of the client’s 
or portfolio company’s business with respect to 
climate impacts. Sectoral pathways can be used as 
a benchmark for comparison and assessment of the 
business or the project where finance is requested. 
Depending on the goals of a particular engagement 
effort, engagement may require a commitment of 
several years and a collaborative approach, along 
with a clear escalation process.
An escalation process with consistent and 
transparent criteria that are communicated to the 
client and portfolio companies should also be a 
critical part of an engagement strategy. This may 
include sharing the financial institution’s net-zero 
transition plan and policies and conditions with 
clients and portfolio companies. When clients or 
portfolio companies show little or no response 
to the engagement, a financial institution should 
consider using the business levers available to 
it according to its business relationship. These 
levers will differ and include stewardship actions 
such as proxy voting, shareholder resolutions, 
and voting to remove directors who have failed in 
their accountability; financing levers such as more 
onerous/costly lending conditions and refusal to 
engage in new business; and, as a last resort,  
cessation of the relationship either as a service or 
product provider, or opting to divest.187 
Financial institutions should consider appropriate 
collaboration to promote a clear and consistent 
engagement objective and streamline the 
information request to the real-economy 
companies. Working together, as appropriate,

disclosure campaign).

can magnify an individual institution’s effort 
to encourage clients and portfolio companies 
to progress work on net-zero commitments. 
For example, financial institutions can consider 
joining industry groups that engage with clients 
and portfolio companies on behalf of a group of 
financial institutions. 188 
The following are examples of client/company-
specific engagement activities and subjects. 
Many of these can be designed to be specific 
two-way communication with clients and 
portfolio companies:
• Share net-zero objectives and priorities with 
clients and companies, including specific 
timelines and consequences, as articulated in 
the financial institution’s net-zero transition plan 
and receive feedback on such. Such discussions 
may include clarifying or explaining to clients/
companies the policies and conditions the 
institution is implementing or any other criteria 
that may impact access to or cost of capital. 
The discussions may also include topics about 
the social impacts of the client/portfolio 
company’s activities.
• Support and advise on topics specific to the 
company or client, such as identifying potential 
high-emitting physical assets accelerated for 
managed phaseout, developing their own 
interim and long-term net-zero commitments 
and science-based transition plan, or aligning 
their business to a net-zero pathway.189 
• Request information on strategic decision-
making and investment required to transition 
business models and provide advice, lessons 
learned, and resources, if applicable.

• Obtain transition-related data 190 through a range 
of interactions such as direct engagement, due 
diligence, and onboarding  processes.
• Monitor and support client actions pursuant to 
net-zero transition plans. 
• Convene forums for targeted roles such as 
CEOs of clients and portfolio companies to 
appropriately raise awareness of climate-
related risks and opportunities and encourage 
investment in net zero-aligned assets or 
investment products.
• Encourage companies and clients who have not 
already sought external validation of metrics, 
targets, and net-zero transition plans (e.g., 
using SBTi, Climate Transition Pathways, World 
Benchmarking Alliance) to do so. 
• Hold leadership accountable for net-zero 
transition progress, including the potential 
integration of remuneration for senior 
decision-makers.
• Exercise rights with respect to proxy voting ,191 
director voting, and shareholder resolutions to 
signal to companies the financial institution’s 
expectations for net-zero transition disclosure, 
planning, and strategy.192 
• Collaborate with clients and portfolio companies 
on a range of topics including understanding 
risk transfer needs from changing risk profiles of 
new and scaling climate solutions and business 
models; deploying decarbonization technology 
for existing high-carbon assets.  
• Provide new collaborations (e.g., facilities, 
captives) to pool and share risks and inform 
risk profiles.
190 This refers to data that can be used to inform on the transition to a net-zero economy, or more broadly, climate change mitigation. 
It is inclusive of, but not limited to, data on entity emissions, targets, transition strategies, transition-related investment, and

193 For example, banks can refer to: University of Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership, Banking Environment Initiative, 
and UNEP-FI. Leadership Strategies for Client Engagement: Advancing climate-related assessments , 2022.
• Include items in Requests for Proposals related 
to net-zero activities, such as the respondent’s 
position on climate-related expertise, climate-
related proxy voting, engagement approaches, 
and methodologies to assess climate-related 
financial risk.
• Develop client assessment methodologies or 
dashboards incorporating sector-specific and 
geography-specific considerations to track 
client performance, prioritize engagements, and 
use as engagement topics. 193 
• Encourage formation of new networks of 
companies to support transition products, 
managed phaseout, transition-related 
infrastructure, and  assets.
The following are examples of engaging 
simultaneously with multiple clients and portfolio 
companies where there is no opportunity for 
individual dialogue:
• Host or participate in governance and 
leadership forums on topics related to the net-
zero transition.
• Issue public statements, commentary, and calls 
to action aimed at accelerating the transition to 
net zero.
• Hold or participate in information sessions  
on the transition to net zero for various  
audiences/groups.
• Participate in initiatives and/or organizations 
aimed at accelerating the transition to net zero.
• Participate in collaborations and/or initiatives 
aimed at understanding and forwarding 
climate solutions.
• Disclose own net-zero goals, timelines, transition 
plans, activities, and expectations.

BOX 6. EXPECTATIONS FOR REAL-ECONOMY TRANSITION PLANS (EXCERPT FROM THE  
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY)195
For the global economy to reach net zero, annual greenhouse gas emissions from activities of real-
economy companies need to rapidly reduce, while financial institutions allocate capital and use their 
influence as shareholders and/or financial partners to support and catalyze such action. 196 It is critical 
to have dialogue and associated flows of data between companies and financial institutions. Disclosure 
of transition plans of real-economy firms, including the detailed assumptions and data that underpins 
them, enables effective engagement and capital allocation across the financial ecosystem. 
GFANZ aims to improve this data flow by increasing the implementation and disclosure of transition 
plans by real-economy companies. The Expectations for Real-economy Transition Plans report serves 
as a practical guide for financial institutions engaging with real-economy companies and for these 
companies when building transition plans and disclosing progress against them. The report provides 
clarity regarding the data financial institutions expect from their real economy clients and portfolio 
companies. Rather than inventing a new framework, the report uses existing guidance and frameworks 
to arrive at the themes, components, and sub-elements financial institutions expect in real-economy 
transition plans.
 
Example 11. Aviva’s engagement program with teeth
Sub-sector: Insurer
In its Climate Transition Plan ,197 Aviva describes how its engagement program relates to its ambition and strategy, 
and “has teeth” in order to drive the transition to net-zero emissions.
The company discusses its Aviva Investors (AI)-led climate engagement escalation program, which is focused on 
30 systemically important carbon emitters in the oil and gas, metals and mining, and utilities sectors held in its 
investment portfolios. Aviva is prepared to send a message to all companies through voting actions when those 
companies do not have adequate climate plans or do not act quickly enough.

Aviva emphasizes the importance of engaging in the first instance, while considering divesting where necessary: 
“[I]t’s crucial to pair emissions reduction targets with engagement targets to encourage the decarbonisation of 
our investees rather than just divesting and switching to lower carbon emitting sectors.” 198

Aviva’s approach aims to encourage ambitious transition strategies, plans, and progress from portfolio companies, 
with an escalation framework when engagement is ineffective.
Aviva reported that, in 2021, AI undertook 112 engagements (meetings and written communication) with the 
30 companies in scope and recorded 95 engagement “wins,” which it defined as improvements in one of the 
following: targets, transition plan, governance, disclosures, or lobbying. 199 
Example 12. AXA Investment Managers (AXA IM) takes a “three strikes, you’re out” escalation 
approach for portfolio  companies
Sub-sector: Asset  Management
As active asset managers, AXA IM considers its power to influence portfolio companies’ behavior. It believes 
“engagement and open dialogue with companies and clients is crucial to understanding and influencing the net-
zero trajectories.” As noted by AXA IM 's Executive Chairman, “if we don’t see progress and strong commitments 
from companies, we need to be brave and bold in their investment decisions and be ready to divest”. 200 
Beginning in 2022, AXA IM, the asset management arm of the French multinational insurance company, began 
applying a stronger climate lens in making its investment decisions. 201 AXA IM’s approach involves evaluating high-
impact companies and issuers, and grouping them into categories to inform ongoing decision-making.

With respect to companies AXA IM considers to be laggards, AXA IM will apply a “three strikes and you’re out” 
approach. 202 This means that if AXA IM does not feel the company’s progress on its net-zero path is substantial 
within three years (2025), AXA IM will divest from the company so that it can reallocate the capital to climate 
transition leaders.  
This example is one approach of an escalation process for a portfolio company engagement strategy. When 
clients or portfolio companies show little or no response to calls for climate action, a financial institution should 
consider using the stewardship or financing levers at its disposal.

Example 13. BlackRock’s public-private finance vehicle ― Climate Finance  Partnership
Sub-sector: Asset  Management
BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, completed the fundraise of its Climate Finance Partnership (CFP) 
Fund in October 2021, achieving a $673 million final close ,203 exceeding its target by 35%. The CFP is a public-
private finance vehicle, first announced in September 2018, that is focused on investing in climate infrastructure 
across emerging and developing markets. CFP is supported by a diverse global investor group including 
governments, philanthropies, and institutional investors.  
The Climate Finance Partnership is built on the following:
Blended Finance Structure: CFP uses a structure that seeks to de-risk the investment in emerging markets for 
institutional investors. 204 The governments of France, Germany, and Japan, together with U.S.  philanthropic 
institutions and a global multi-energy company, participate through a subordinated equity tranche to incentivize 
private investors to participate.
Climate Infrastructure Investing:  CFP aims to invest in climate solutions such as onshore wind and utility-scale 
and distributed solar PV, and supporting climate infrastructure such as battery storage and clean transmission 
projects. Through these investments, the CFP aims to reduce potential emissions from emerging markets by 
preventing the need for incremental fossil fuel development and generation while providing access to affordable, 
reliable, clean  energy.
ESG Risk Identification, Management, and Reporting:  CFP is implementing an ESG framework compliant with 
International Finance Corporation (IFC) performance standards to support the entire life cycle of its investments. 
CFP has also put together a collaborative committee composed of experts across BlackRock and some of CFP’s 
investors, seeking to bring together leaders in the field of ESG risk identification and management. CFP and its 
investors will also feature measurement and reporting aligned with the UN SDGs, Global Impact Investing Network 
(GIIN), and Impact Reporting and Investment Standards (IRIS).  
This fundraising effort is an example of how financial institutions can engage with private and public partners, 
including their clients, to mobilize institutional capital for the transition in emerging markets.

205 Dai-ichi Life Group. Responsible Investment Report 2021 , 2021.
206 Ibid., p. 46.
The Dai-ichi Life Insurance Company has developed a strategy that includes engagement with portfolio companies 
on setting ambitious GHG emissions reduction targets and on disclosure regarding the financial impact of climate 
change. 205 In line with the Net-zero Asset Owners Alliance (NZAOA) protocol, in 2021, Dai-ichi conducted targeted 
climate-related engagements aimed at pursuing net zero-aligned actions with the 50 companies in its investment 
portfolio with the highest emissions. Dai-ichi has also been participating in collaborative engagement initiatives 
such as Climate Action 100+ and Institutional Investors Collective Engagement Forum (IICEF) to add to its 
engagement  activities.
With regard to climate change issues, Dai-ichi asks companies to 1) set ambitious reduction targets consistent with 
the Paris Agreement, 2) formulate a concrete roadmap to achieve the targets, and 3) integrate the targets and 
roadmap into their medium- and long-term strategies. 
Dai-ichi tracks engagement progress based on four milestones:

 Progress has been made to solve the issues raised with companies over time. The companies have resolved 
roughly 80% of governance and 60% of management strategy issues identified before fiscal year 2016.
 In light of factors such as Japan’s commitment to carbon neutrality, investee companies have also furthered 
their response to environmental and social issues and have resolved about 50% of the issues identified in 
fiscal year 2018.
 We will continue to identify and follow themes centered on critical issues for investee companies.

9. Report on Stewardship Activities (Our History for stewardship activities and Review)
If a company does not show any improvement on ESG issues, including climate change, Dai-ichi will vote to 
oppose reappointment of representative directors. In Dai-ichi’s experience, the majority of companies are willing 
to engage in dialogue and they do improve on issues Dai-ichi raises. Despite its best efforts to support transition, 
if a company refuses to recognize or address an issue Dai-ichi has raised, Dai-ichi will take that into account in its 
investment decision-making and may ultimately divest its holding. 
Achieving all four milestones can take some time. For example, Dai-ichi has been engaging with an iron and steel 
company since 2016. 206 Dai-ichi first engaged the company about setting climate change targets and creating a 
roadmap to reduce its GHG emissions. In 2019, the company endorsed TCFD and disclosed its scenario analysis 
results. By 2021, the company disclosed its CO₂ emissions reduction targets. Getting to that point required six 
engagement sessions. Dai-ichi classifies the climate change issues as having been “addressed” by the portfolio 
company (milestone 3 in Figure  16) and will continue engaging, pushing it to conduct more sophisticated scenario 
analysis and to support its emissions reduction initiatives.

Swedish bank SEB has placed “supporting our customers and society at large” at the center of its efforts to 
accelerate change. 207 Recognizing that as a bank, it interacts with large corporations and financial institutions, 
SMEs, private individuals, employees, shareholders, and wider society, SEB sees engagement as an opportunity to 
achieve its “strong ambition to accelerate the pace towards a sustainable future.” 208 
SEB has outlined how it will engage customers to make a positive impact through engagement, including those it 
has identified as green, in transition, or suitable for selective engagement. At the same time, where it finds that a 
customer’s convictions do not align with SEB’s, it will not shy away from phasing out engagement with that client 
in an orderly fashion. Figure  17 shows how SEB approaches engaging — and disengaging, when necessary — with 
companies in its credit portfolio. 209

Recommendation
Proactively engage with peers in the industry to 
1) as appropriate, exchange transition expertise 
and collectively work on common challenges 
and 2) represent the financial sector’s views 
cohesively to external stakeholders, such as 
clients and governments.
2) COMPONENT: INDUSTRY
Overview and relevance: No single financial 
institution will determine the success of the global 
transition to net zero and limit global warming 
to 1.5 degrees C. A collective effort is required 
from finance, the public sector, civil society, and 
the real economy. Sharing transition lessons 
learned, pooling resources to address common 
challenges where appropriate, and developing 
collaborative initiatives will benefit all institutions’ 
transition plans.
Guidance: Financial institutions should pursue 
with peers (where relevant, appropriate, and in 
compliance with all applicable antitrust laws) and 
other industry-related bodies working in these 
areas,213 any of the following objectives that are 
consistent with their net-zero priorities and support 
1.5 degrees C alignment:
213 Industry-related bodies may include civil society and nongovernmental organizations providing subject matter expertise, 
targeted initiatives, and collaborative opportunities, among other purposes (e.g., Council for Inclusive Capitalism’s Just Energy 
Transition Framework for Company Action, ShareAction, WWF, World Resources Institute).
1. Learn from other institutions  through 
discussion, and share noncompetitive, 
nonconfidential details about tools, data, and 
methodologies that enable and accelerate the 
design, implementation, assessment, and review 
of a net-zero transition plan. For example:
 – encourage adoption of net-zero transition 
plans across the industry, particularly with 
less advanced peers, by being transparent 
about implementation experiences/
lessons learned;
 – seek common approaches or frameworks 
to support comparability, driving further 
momentum and accountability;
 – collaborate where appropriate to solve 
challenges that arise in designing and 
executing a transition plan. For example, 
pursue joint transactions or financing 
vehicles to increase scale of net zero-
focused services and tools, such as industrial 
clusters for hydrogen or carbon capture 
storage technologies; 
 – engage in cross-sector initiatives in the real 
economy to help accelerate the phaseout of 
high-emitting assets and rollout of transition 
infrastructure; and
 – work to encourage appropriate government 
net-zero targets and strategies; promote 
government policies, regulations, and 
environments that facilitate net zero-
aligned investment; advocate against 
policies that may act as roadblocks to the 
net-zero transition; and encourage science-
based public policies that incorporate 
transition considerations.

2. Represent a pan-financial sector view on 
critical issues , including those communicated 
to governments, the public sector, and real-
economy counterparties. Financial institutions 
can contribute to sector-wide ambition and 
solutions in multiple ways. They  can:
 – join a sector-specific net-zero alliance that 
brings peers together under a common set of 
commitments, and help members implement 
those commitments;
 – join relevant industry initiatives that focus 
on net-zero transition planning for a specific 
sector or on a specific topic ;214 
 – participate in sector-specific or pan-sector 
finance group(s) that are working toward 
consistency on expectations for real-
economy companies on information needs, 
such as real-economy disclosure; and 
 – work to address and overcome data 
challenges by collecting consistent  data.
214 Examples include MPP, SMI, First Mover Coalition, and Climate Transition Pathways.
215 Examples include the Powering Past Coal Alliance Declaration , the Financial Sector Commitment Letter on Eliminating 
Commodity-Driven Deforestation , and the Global Methane  Pledge.
216 Examples include GFANZ’s Call to Action and the Investor Agenda’s 2021 Global Investor Statement to Governments on the 
Climate Crisis.
3. Sign on to public climate transition-  
specific commitments. 215
 – Jointly develop or publicly support  
industry-wide calls to action aimed at 
policymakers, regulators, supervisors,   
and global standard setters. 216
 – Enter into bilateral and multilateral 
engagements with both financial institutions 
and stakeholders outside the sector to 
build industry- and system-wide thought 
leadership and to enable solutions. 
Partnerships could be with real-economy 
firms, governments, or civil society 
organizations. Examples include climate and 
net-zero data utility efforts, open-source 
analytics solutions, industry-wide reporting 
solutions, platforms to scale the financing 
available for the energy transition, and 
innovative low-carbon technologies.
 – Lead or participate in public webinars, 
events, or panels to enable knowledge 
sharing on a mass scale across the industry 
or pan-sector, on both technical and 
operational topics relating to the net-
zero transition.

218 IATA. Our Commitment to Fly Net Zero by 2050 , October 4, 2021.
219 SBTi. Science-Based Target Setting for the Aviation Sector , version 1.0, August 2021.
RMI’s Center for Climate-Aligned Finance is partnering with six banks that are active in the aviation sector with  
the goal of helping decarbonize the sector. 217 
GHG emissions from aviation are considered hard to abate, and to achieve net-zero aviation emissions by 2050, 
the sector will require more efficient aircraft, new aviation technology, and sustainable aviation fuels. 218 The SBTi 
estimated in its Aviation Guidance 219 that the sector needs to reduce its carbon intensity by 35% to 40% between 
2019 and 2035, and by 65% between 2019 and 2050. The six banks acknowledged that “the financial sector will 
play a crucial role in funding the technologies, projects, and companies involved in this net-zero transition.”
In April 2022, the banks announced the Aviation Climate-Aligned Finance Working Group, which aspires to 
collectively define common goals for action for aviation sector decarbonization before the end of 2022.  
Financial institutions participating in a framework being developed would agree to annually assess and disclose 
the degree to which the GHG from the aircraft, airlines, and lessors that they finance are in line with 1.5 degrees C 
climate targets.
This effort shows how engagement in cross-sector initiatives in the real economy may help to accelerate 
the managed phaseout of high-emitting assets and rollout of transition infrastructure, and to seek common 
approaches or frameworks to support comparability, driving further momentum and accountability. 
The six banks aim to create consistency and transparency in reporting and measuring progress to climate  
targets. Financial institutions using the climate-aligned framework will be able to assess the emissions of their 
aviation loan books, and work with their clients to report their emissions, fund lower-carbon solutions, and support 
investments in new technologies. The intent is to design the framework for rapid adoption by aviation financiers 
globally. The working group will invite other financial institutions to adopt the climate-aligned finance framework 
by the end of 2022.

Sub-sector: Asset Owner
The Investor Agenda is a collaboration of groups that work with investors — AIGCC, CDP, Ceres, IGCC, IIGCC, 
PRI, and UNEP FI 220 — focused on developing guidance for investors to address the climate crisis and advocating 
collectively for public policy to accelerate the net-zero transition. 
The Investor Agenda released a framework for Investor Climate Action Plans (ICAPs), the ICAPs Expectations 
Ladder,221 in May 2021 to provide investors with clear expectations for issuing and implementing comprehensive 
climate action plans to support the goal of a net-zero economy by 2050 or sooner. The ICAPs Expectations 
Ladder summarizes the key climate actions investors can take in the four focus areas of the Investor Agenda: 
investment, corporate engagement, policy advocacy, and investor disclosure. Governance is a crosscutting theme 
across all four areas. 
An example of an investor who has developed a climate action plan following this guidance is the New York State 
Common Retirement Fund (CRF), one of the largest public pension plans in the United States. It published its 
Climate Action Plan222 in June 2019, which sets out its climate-related assessments, investments, engagement,  
and advocacy work.
Following publication of its Climate Action Plan, in December 2020, CRF announced its commitment to reduce 
GHG emissions from its entire portfolio to net zero by 2040.223 In April 2021 CRF issued a progress report on its 
Climate Action Plan. 224 In this report, CRF explains how it uses engagement to help mitigate its climate-related 
risks. It files climate change-related shareholder resolutions, and it recently updated its proxy voting guidelines  
to inc
lude specific climate guidelines. 
CRF performs direct engagement with portfolio companies in high-impact climate sectors. 225 It urges companies 
to establish transition strategies, to develop strategic CapEx planning, to adopt GHG emissions targets, and to 
disclose emissions data and other key climate-related disclosures. In addition, it engages its top global equity and 
fixed income external managers in areas of climate governance, risk management, engagement, proxy voting, and 
TCFD reporting. 
As part of its public policy advocacy work, CRF has weighed in on a number of important climate-related 
investment and regulatory issues.226 Its advocacy work includes testifying, providing public comments, and 
participating i n state, 
national, and international foru ms.

Overview and relevance: Public policy and227 
regulation shape international, national, regional, 
and local strategies for transitioning to net zero, 
and will have significant impact on real-economy 
corporations as well as financial institutions. 
Financial institutions engage with a range of 
government and public-sector institutions on a 
broad set of topics through advocacy, lobbying, and 
other indirect channels, with the goal of influencing 
the direction of policy and regulation.228, 229 
Guidance: Financial institutions engaging with 
public-sector institutions should proactively include 
topics that support or enable an accelerated and 
orderly transition to net zero. Several of these topics 
were laid out in the GFANZ Policy Call to Action 
(published in October 2021, with an update on 
progress published in November 2022) and could 
be used to guide engagement with government and 
public sector. Examples include the following:

231 T he NZIA paper, Insuring the net-zero transition: Evolving thinking and practices , 2022, offers the following observation: 
“Government policies that have a positive environmental impact often require more than one company to make changes… A key 
question for the NZIA is therefore how to implement cross-industry environmental initiatives while complying with antitrust laws 
and regulation…the NZIA and its members have begun to engage with antitrust regulators in global jurisdictions on the impact of 
antitrust laws and regulations on the net-zero agenda and the benefits possible with industry cooperation and approaches such as 
open standard setting.” p. 34.

Financial institutions should work to ensure that 
policy engagement strategies are supportive of 
net zero and they should set out clear, objective 
statements with their focus areas for government 
support. To do so, financial institutions should 
conduct reviews of direct and indirect policy 
positions to see that they are aligned with the 
institution's net-zero commitments and with the 
overall transition to a net-zero economy.234 , 235, 236
Some approaches to government and public-sector 
engagement include the following: 
• Review and discuss if financial sector trade
associations’ climate policy positions and
lobbying activities are aligned with achieving

Impax Asset Management is a UK-based asset management group working to demonstrate its commitment to 
reaching net-zero GHG emissions by 2050, in line with global efforts to limit warming to 1.5 degrees C. Since its 
inception in 1998, Impax has invested in companies and assets that lead or benefit from the transition to a more 
sustainable economy. Impax sees active engagement as a key part of its role and collaborates with clients and 
others to create policies supportive of a low-carbon, sustainable economy. 
Impax has established a Global Policy Group, with a dedicated lead and senior membership including the CEO.  
The group brings together expertise from across the firm to implement a rolling three-year advocacy plan 
focused on engagement with policymakers in Europe and the United States. Impax deploys a variety of advocacy 
approaches, ranging from traditional interventions (e.g., consultations and sign-on letters) to more proactive 
activity (e.g., publishing perspectives and funding research). Impax also applies its environmental markets 
expertise to stimulate innovation in science and technology, such as through its CEO’s role as an independent 
director on the UK government’s Net Zero Innovation Board . 
In the last two years, Impax has focused its activities on financing the energy transition; nature-based solutions; 
physical climate risk; and greening the finance industry. In early 2020, Impax produced a Clean Investment 
Roadmaps white paper ,238 which called for governments to make investment opportunities more explicit 
by breaking down their national climate goals into clear sectoral roadmaps. The white paper also called on 
policymakers to establish dialogues with investors and other key stakeholders on the design of policies likely  
to attract finance into the solutions needed in each sector.
Impax actively contributed to commitments and calls to action that emerged at COP26, including: 
• the Investor Agenda Global Investor Statement to Governments on the Climate Crisis ,239 which calls for 
governments to strengthen their NDCs to align with a transition to net zero; commit to a clear decarbonization 
roadmap for each carbon-intensive sector; implement domestic policies to incentivize private investments; and 
commit to mandatory climate  disclosures;
• the Energy Transitions Commission (ETC) report Keeping 1.5 degree C Alive: Closing the Gap in the 2020s ,240 
which set out the key actions needed, sector by sector, to deliver the Paris Agreement; and
• various “coalitions of the willing” that committed to ambitious global action in key sectors (e.g., the PPCA,  
the Natural Capital Investment Alliance, investor commitment to deforestation-free portfolios, and NZAM).
During 2021, Impax also advocated in favor of improvements to the regulation of climate-related disclosures. 
It was a lead author of the Climate Financial Risk Forum’s Climate Data and Metrics report 241 whose 
recommendations were referenced in the FCA’s subsequent consultation on TCFD implementation. In response 
to the SEC’s request for inputs on climate disclosure, Impax submitted a set of detailed recommendations 242 that 
informed the SEC’s proposed rule published in March 2022.

Overview and relevance: This report acknowledges 
that specific metrics and targets methodologies 
may be more suited to a certain sector or net-zero

there are challenges in using certain metrics, and in 
the availability and quality of data. Some of these

and road transport); Materials (steel, cement, and aluminum); Agriculture, forestry, and fisheries; Chemicals; Construction and 
buildings; Water utilities; and Textiles and leather. Financial institutions should consider other sectors for Scope 3 that are 
proportionally material to their financed emissions and where data allows. Financial institutions should also refer to their sector-

zero Transition Plans — Supplemental Information 
report. However, these challenges are not a reason 
to delay target setting or measurement, and the 
rapid evolution and direction of travel of data 
availability and measurement methodologies may 
inform selection of metrics and targets. 
In addition, GFANZ recognizes that Scope 3 
emissions of clients and portfolio companies are 
critical for financial institutions to evaluate in their 
metrics and target setting. Many regulators and 
industry bodies have highlighted the importance of 
including Scope 3 financed emissions. 243, 244
Financial institutions should take care to set and 
use various metrics and targets appropriately. 
Metrics and targets can be used for multiple 
purposes, such as signaling commitment to net 
zero; driving action inside an institution; increasing 
understanding of client and portfolio company 
plans; and driving financing to real-economy 
transition activities. 
THEME
Metrics and Targets
Metrics and targets provide credibility and clarity when financial institutions communicate their net-zero 
strategy to internal and external stakeholders. Quantitative metrics and targets are necessary to ground 
net-zero ambition in specific objectives and concrete actions, and to track progress over time. Well-
formulated targets allow for the assessment of an organization’s long-term decarbonization strategy, as 
well as its interim activities and results. The appropriate metrics and targets for a given financial institution 
will depend on its overall objectives and priorities. This theme focuses on the selection and use of metrics 
and targets.
Recommendation
Establish a suite of metrics and targets to drive 
execution of the net-zero transition plan and 
monitor progress of results in the near, medium, 
and long term. Include metrics and targets 
focused on aligning financial activity in support 
of the real-economy net-zero transition; on 
executing the transition plan; and on measuring 
changes in client and portfolio GHG emissions.

Last, some essential transition actions, like 
supporting firms in the early stages of transition or 
funding the managed phaseout of high-emitting 
physical assets, may result in increased financed 
emissions in the near term but contribute to 
meaningful decreases in the medium or long term. 
To capture this progress for both interim and 
long-term targets, financial institutions may use 
multiple metrics to gain a better understanding of 
the effectiveness of a net-zero transition plan as 
a whole.
Greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, 
methane, and nitrous oxide, should be 
considered within GHG metrics and targets. 245

General guidance 
Selection and calculation of metrics and targets 
should be aligned with financial sector guidance 
to support transparency and comparability. 
Institutions should regularly review targets

there are material updates or developments in data, 
methodology, business models; or if targets are 
met sooner than anticipated. 
Where logistically possible, scheduling of emissions 
targets monitoring should be designed to align 
with reporting timelines used for other corporate 
strategy and capital planning targets to allow for 
easier integration. Common timelines facilitate 
joint reviews by the Board (or equivalent body) 
and senior management committees and create 
opportunity for joint consideration of all business 
strategies and priorities.
Where available, to provide stakeholders with 
independent assurance that targets and data are 
credible, financial institutions should consider 
seeking external validation for their GHG emissions 
targets from third parties.
Financial institutions are encouraged to set and 
monitor progress toward a net-zero emissions 
reduction target on their own operational and 
corporate value chain emissions, in addition to their 
financed emissions, to which this report applies. 246 
BOX 7. CONSIDERATIONS FOR ABSOLUTE AND INTENSITY METRICS247 
A key design choice in selecting emissions and portfolio alignment metrics and targets is whether to 
base these on measures of absolute emissions, or some form of intensity ratio. 
Absolute emissions metrics may offer the benefit of a direct link to the carbon budget and can also 
be applied consistently across sectors. However, they can discourage the transformation needed. 
Absolute metrics may disincentivize investment in transition sectors, constrain growth of low-
emissions entities, and make comparability of different-sized portfolios or entities difficult. 
An economic intensity metric, based on a simple calculation (e.g., emissions/revenue) can address  
some of the challenges above. They allow for growth, investment, and comparability across sectors  
METRICS AND TARGETS

79
and portfolios. However, they target emissions efficiency improvements less directly, and can also 
be subject to volatility through changes in the denominator that may be unrelated to climate such as 
changes in company revenue. 
Physical intensity metrics address these concerns by scaling emissions relative to a production 
measure (e.g., MWh produced), which can then encourage a transformation of the business through 
greater use of carbon-efficient technologies and processes. However, use of sector-specific 
production data does not support comparability between sectors and such data for each sector may 
not always be available. There is also a debate over whether physical intensity metrics are best suited 
in the fossil fuel sectors where net-zero scenarios suggest a reduction in production is required, which 
may not be as easily conveyed by intensity metrics. 
Both types of intensity metrics can result in total emissions increasing even if the carbon intensity 
measure used decreases. There is also a risk of volatility across both absolute and intensity metrics in 
high-emitting industries because of several factors such as fluctuations in revenue, production volume, 
and market movements. Drivers of the changes in the metrics should be tracked to attribute the 
change to emissions reduction efforts or other factors. Ultimately getting absolute emissions to zero 
is the end goal, and both absolute and intensity metrics should be considered together to measure 
progress of different pathways to net zero.
Guidance by metric categories  
Institutions should use multiple metrics to track 
progress toward their interim and final net-zero 
targets. GFANZ acknowledges that emphasizing 
portfolio emissions reduction targets, such as 
portfolio footprints, could have unintended 
consequences of reducing financing support to 
real-economy emissions reduction efforts as laid 
out in Part B. Therefore, this guidance recommends 
complementing client and portfolio emissions  
metrics with metrics that focus on real-economy 
emissions reductions. The latter may be related to 
any or all of the four key financing strategies the 
financial institution selected as its objectives and 
priorities. Also, metrics to track internal progress 
in executing the net-zero transition plan are key to 
managing the implementation of the plan. Figure  
19 summarizes the three overarching categories of 
metrics and targets that can be used to monitor 
progress against net-zero objectives and priorities.

Metrics and targets for each category are meant to measure progress for different aspects of a net-zero commitment. Category 1 
focuses on how financing and related services enable emissions reduction in the real economy. Category 2 focuses on the execution  
of the plan within a financial institution. Category 3 reflects the changes in the real economy broadly in client and company portfolios. 
As the rollout of the net-zero transition plan progresses, progress may be seen in category 1 and, finally, category 3.
 
The three categories introduced in Figure  19, which 
financial institutions should consider monitoring 
and setting targets against, are described here with 
detailed discussions of key considerations.
See the “Metrics and targets examples and case 
studies” section in the Financial Institution Net-
zero Transition Plans — Supplemental Information 
report for examples of metrics and targets for all 
three categories.
 
1. Metrics and targets for the real-
economy transition 
Financial institutions should use metrics and targets 
to monitor and describe progress in supporting the 
key financing strategies they selected to prioritize 
in their transition plans. The four key financing 
strategies are positive actions to decarbonize the 
 
real economy as introduced in Part B and include 
financing and related services to enable and 
support 1) climate solutions; 2) companies already 
aligned to net zero; 3) the transition of companies 
committed to aligning; and 4) the managed 
phaseout of high-emitting physical assets. Because 
these actions could temporarily increase client 
and portfolio emissions in the short term, using 
only portfolio emissions footprint metrics may 
not reflect the extent of transition activities the 
financial institution may be supporting. 
Table 8 provides some illustrative examples of 
the potential key financing strategies may have 
on portfolio emissions and why use of only 
backward-looking portfolio footprint metrics could 
be misleading.

Table 8. Example interplay between the four key financing strategies and portfolio emissions 248
KEY FINANCING  STRATEGY EXAMPLE IMPACT ON PORTFOLIO EMISSIONS (NOT EXHAUSTIVE)
1. Climate solutions • If a portfolio company meets increased demand for its low-emissions technology, 
its own emissions could likely increase and the financial institution’s overall portfolio 
emissions may increase  proportionally.
• Conversely, if entities using low-emissions technologies are included in the financial 
institution’s portfolio, overall portfolio emissions could decrease as the technology  
is deployed. 
2. Aligned • Portfolio emissions could decrease as more companies or clients in the portfolio are 
aligned to net zero.
3. Aligning • Portfolio emissions could increase with the addition of more high-emitting real-
economy firms that are just beginning to transition.
• As firms execute their net-zero transition plans, reductions in portfolio emissions in 
line with 1.5 degrees C-aligned pathways take place.
4. Managed  phaseout • Portfolio emissions may initially be higher if the financial institution is financing high-
emitting assets with plans to accelerate their retirement.
• Significant reductions in portfolio emissions may only occur as the phaseout plan 
is completed.
248 Recall that portfolio emissions include those associated with a financial institution’s investment, lending, and underwriting 
portfolios, or from clients of investment consultants or financial service providers.
249 GFANZ. Guidance on Use of Sectoral Pathways for Financial Institutions , June 2022.
Where possible, a financial institution should test 
the assumptions around the inputs used in the 
calculation of real-economy targets and metrics 
to assess how the institution’s performance and 
progress may be impacted by external conditions 
that differ from the initial assumptions (e.g., 
availability of technology or government policies). 
Additionally, financial institutions should consider 
how external influences, such as regional policies 
and sectoral pathways, may affect their transition 
plan assumptions. 249 
Table 9 presents guidance for each approach, 
particularly on metrics. Such metrics could be 
based on emissions or on transition-related 
categories and should consider both backward- 
and forward-looking methodologies as shown  
in examples in the Financial Institution Net-zero 
Transition Plans — Supplemental Information report. 
Constructing a target framework that best 
accounts for key financing strategies of climate 
solutions, incentivizing real-world decarbonization 
efforts, and managed phaseout requires further 
research to establish net-zero benchmarks (see 
“Expansion of metrics and targets” section 
in the Financial Institution Net-zero Transition 
Plans — Supplemental Information). In addition, 
financial institutions should consider working 
toward expressing an umbrella metric, transition 
finance, to represent the proportion of their total 
business that relates to the four key financing 
strategies collectively.

Table 9. Guidance for metrics and target setting across four key financing strategies to net-zero capital 
allocation and related  services
KEY FINANCING  STRATEGY GUIDANCE
1. Climate solutions Financial institutions seeking to enable and finance the development or scaling of 
climate solutions should consider a range of metrics to track the impact of solutions on 
real-economy emissions reduction. Target setting for climate solutions is still nascent, 
but, where available, sectoral pathways could be used to set targets in line with the 
scale needed to achieve net zero. (See “Expansion of metrics and targets” section in 
the Financial Institution Net-zero Transition Plans — Supplemental Information  report 
for further discussion.)
2. Aligned Financial institutions supporting those companies or assets that are already substantially 
aligned should determine the metrics to monitor progress of financing of this key strategy. 
These metrics could be drawn from criteria used to assess the current and ongoing 
alignment to a 1.5 degrees C pathway of the companies or assets. The criteria should also 
be reviewed and updated over time.
3. Aligning Financial institutions supporting those companies that have committed to transition 
and are beginning the process, or are still transitioning, should determine metrics to 
monitor links between financing support and transition activities, as well as progress 
of financing of this key approach. These metrics could be drawn from the criteria of 
what “transitioning” means. This criteria will be similar to that for companies and assets 
already aligned to net zero but account for an earlier stage of transition activity and 
depend heavily on net-zero transition plans and their execution. The criteria should also 
be reviewed and updated periodically.
4. Managed  phaseout The GFANZ report The Managed Phaseout of High-emitting Assets provides initial   
and preliminary guidance on a net zero-aligned approach to financing or enabling 
high-emitting assets where there is a plan for their early retirement. The report notes 
that such an approach would need its own metrics and targets. Financial institutions 
should consider metrics that demonstrate how a Managed Phaseout plan through  
early retirement will reduce emissions as well as broader impacts (e.g., related to  
the workforce). 
2. Metrics and targets for plan execution  
Financial institutions should set targets and monitor 
metrics that indicate their organization’s progress 
in executing on their net-zero transition. Similar 
to other strategic plans of the institution, clear 
corporate financial and operational KPIs should be 
monitored and reviewed on a regular basis. These 
could pertain to any of the themes and components 
discussed in this report that show activity of 
the institution’s teams in applying their net-zero 
commitment to parts of the business. 
Financial institutions should select metrics and set 
targets for engagement programs, in alignment 
with sector-specific guidance, where available.  
3. Metrics and targets for financed emissions  
Financial institutions should choose financed 
emissions metrics and targets, and the 
methodologyto develop them, in alignment with 
sector-specific guidance, where available, or with 
industry standards. Multiple metrics may be   
needed to assess different aspects of an 
institution’s portfolio and business activities  
(e.g., across different sectors, or to distinguish 
between on balance sheet emissions versus those 
'facilitated' by financial institutions on the behalf 
of their clients). Using both forward-looking and 
backward-looking metrics should be considered 
for a more holistic assessment (historical climate 
performance and future net-zero plans) of 
companies and clients.
Emissions reduction targets should be consistent 
with science-based, 1.5 degrees C-aligned scenarios 
and sectoral pathways, where available, to reach 
net-zero emissions by 2050 and should include 
interim targets for 2030 or sooner. Financial 
institutions should use low- or no-overshoot 
scenarios wherever available. Key elements to be 
included in GHG emissions reduction target-setting 
methodologies include:

Financial institutions should consider also 
developing metrics to monitor progress on changing 
portfolio composition, supporting the explanation 
of portfolio emissions increase or reduction. These 
metrics may include the proportion of GHG portfolio 
emissions reduction that are a result of changes in 
portfolio composition and those by changes in the 
underlying companies.272
Where carbon credits are used by financial 
institutions or their clients, financial institutions 
should monitor how credits are used and the type 
and quality of credits. The use of credits should be 
monitored alongside, but separate from portfolio 
emissions. Financial institutions should consider 
specifying whether credits are being used to 
neutralize residual emissions or to compensate 
emissions beyond emissions reduction targets on

Standard call for a policy to define the circumstances that trigger a recalculation. There are additional data consistency 
considerations in such cases.  
273 See the Financial Institution Net-zero Transition Plans — Supplemental Information report for additional information on ongoing 
initiatives to define standards for the use and quality of carbon credits. For example, SBTi notes that “Carbon credits may only be 
considered to be an option for neutralizing residual emissions or to finance additional climate mitigation beyond their science-
based emission reduction targets. SBTi. SBTI Corporate Net-zero Standard. 2022 . (Note that the SBTi guidance for financial

also set separate carbon credit targets alongside 
emissions reduction  targets.
These metrics could include the following:
• The number of credits by type: type of credit  
(i.e., reduction, removal), type of mitigation 
activity, and the accounting methodology to 
measure the emissions  reduction.
• Certification/verification of the credits: 
standards, issuing registries, and other relevant 
details to ensure that credits are verified to 
be high-quality.
• How and when the credits are used: for

to net zero or after net zero is obtained, and/or 
against outside value chain emissions.

The SBTi is an organization dedicated to promoting the adoption of science-based target setting by companies 
and financial institutions (FIs) as they embark on their transition to net zero. Within the net-zero ecosystem, the 
SBTi is unique in providing independent, transparent, and quantitative assessment of company and financial 
institution targets. The SBTi believes that the focus of FI net-zero targets “should not lie on reaching a state of 
net-zero GHG emissions within portfolios but instead, ensuring that net-zero targets incentivize FIs to sufficiently 
contribute to helping achieve the global goal of net-zero emissions at a planetary level.” 280  
In its Foundations for Science-Based Net-Zero Target Setting in the Financial Sector report, the SBTi proposed a 
set of four principles to “guide the formulation and assessment of net-zero targets.” 281
To drive the action needed to meet societal climate and sustainability goals, the SBTi stresses the principle of 
“completeness .” This means that FIs should ensure their net-zero targets lead to a state that is “compatible with 
reaching net-zero emissions at the global level.” 282 To achieve this, the SBTi says FIs should address all operational 
and financing activities — not just those they can directly influence. 
The SBTi sets out its expectations that FIs should “transition and align their financing activities to net zero in 
line with pathways that achieve the Paris Agreement” 283 in its “science-based ambition ” principle. This principle 
encourages FIs to consider both the synergies and trade-offs between different pathways.
METRICS AND TARGETS
CONTENTS  |  FINANCIAL INSTITUTION NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLANS — FUNDAMENTALS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND GUIDANCE
86
The SBTi understands that actions FIs take to achieve portfolio reductions can have different outcomes on 
real-world emissions, depending on how they are implemented. On this issue, the SBTi’s “ real economy impact ” 
principle states that FIs “should leverage their abilities to influence and engage other actors as well as focus their 
financing activities to help achieve economy-wide decarbonization and a just transition, and not simply reduce 
portfolio exposure to GHG emissions.” 284 
The SBTi emphasizes that the development of climate solutions is needed in parallel to the decarbonization 
of existing assets, with the two being complementary in supporting the economy’s transition to net zero. The 
SBTi’s “decarbonization and climate solutions ” principle outlines how FIs should consider both the financing of 
decarbonization efforts as well as climate solutions. 285 
In addition to these principles, this SBTi report provides further detail on metrics and targets for different types  
of FIs, and the opportunity to assess and validate science-based targets.

Overview and relevance: Ultimate accountability 
rests with the Chief Executive Officer and relevant 
governance body responsible for strategic 
oversight, to set a bold, actionable plan and ensure 
that the organization can adapt to effectively 
implement it. Several functions within a financial 
institution are typically involved in the design and 
execution of a net-zero transition plan. Establishing 
effective governance processes and structures, 
with clear roles, responsibilities, and remuneration, 
is critical to the success of the plan’s design 
and execution. Remuneration and incentives for 
individuals should be in line with key performance 
indicators related to the net-zero transition plan 
and relevant to the individual’s role. 
THEME
Governance
Governance structures are key mechanisms for enabling financial institutions to oversee progress 
toward net-zero targets. The outcome of a net-zero transition plan will flow directly from governance 
and leadership tone. Identifying senior personnel for specific oversight and implementation roles and 
responsibilities, and linking remuneration, where structure allows, to achieving progress, will ensure 
appropriate resources are deployed. 
Senior personnel will be responsible for ensuring that all teams across their organization have the required 
climate transition-related skills, resources, and understanding to deliver the desired results. Leaders can 
support a culture of innovation and maximum employee engagement to find creative solutions to meeting 
the net-zero objectives. Transparent communication about the transition plan and ongoing progress keeps 
internal stakeholders up-to-date and adds another layer of accountability.
Climate-related governance should be integrated at the highest levels of a financial institution and should 
flow down to every part of the organization through training, education, and engagement.
Recommendation
Define roles for the Board or strategy oversight 
body and senior management ensuring they 
have ownership, oversight, and responsibility 
for the net-zero targets. Assign appropriate 
individuals and teams to all aspects of both 
design and delivery of the transition plan. Use 
remuneration incentives for all roles, where 
possible. Review the transition plan regularly 
to ensure material updates/developments 
are incorporated; challenges are reviewed 
as an opportunity to correct course; and 
implementation risks are properly  managed.

Guidance: Financial institutions should establish 
a clear mandate, role, and authority for the Board 
(or equivalent governance body) and its sub-
committees in the oversight of transition planning. 
The Board or body charged with oversight should 
consider including members with climate-related 
experience and expertise. This body should be 
responsible for providing advice; reviewing the 
suitability of the transition plan and its design; 
and assessing progress toward stated targets.

Financial institutions should ensure that there are 
clear roles, responsibilities, and remuneration for 
the design and execution of the transition plan in 
order to embed it at all levels of the organization. 
At the senior management level, individuals with 
accountability for design and delivery should be 
specified. These accountable individuals should 
have sufficient authority to deploy resources and 
set operational objectives. Scope of authority 
may cover ability to secure access to specialist 
advisors, to develop resources and tools to ensure 
effective implementation, to enhance or implement 
IT systems for data collection, and to develop 
a network to stay informed of the progress of 
industry peers and other organizations that offer 
relevant information and insight.
Typically, responsibilities for the execution of 
the transition plan involve functions across 
the organization and cover the full scope of its 
business activities. Table 12 suggests key functions 
that might be involved, in addition to teams 
leading sustainability efforts. The examples are 
not exhaustive.

Financial institutions should regularly report on 
the status of the transition plan to the Board or 
strategy oversight body and to senior management, 
with relevant reporting thresholds and escalation 
protocols in place. In addition to business metrics 
already reported, key transition-related items 
monitored and reported could include:
• metrics for activities supporting the real-
economy transition;
• results from key engagement activities;
• change management performance indicators as 
the net-zero transition strategy is embedded in 
business processes across the organization;  
• identification of key transition plan execution 
risks and how they are being mitigated (or 
accepted); and 
• reports from third-party assessment of the 
transition plan and progress.
Financial institutions should update or refine 
performance criteria, role descriptions, and 
remuneration throughout the organization to 
reflect the transition plan objectives and targets, 
including for senior management. Remuneration  for

C-suite roles could be directly linked to transition 
plan targets, where structures allow. 
Incentives should be tailored to individuals’ roles, 
their progress against performance targets, and their 
contribution to the transition plan implementation. 
Incentives should be reviewed annually alongside 
performance and should include outcomes for both 
when targets are met and when they are not.
These incentives can be designed to:
• reward performance on net-zero transition 
objectives, where possible designing incentives 
to emphasize quantifiable real-economy  change;
• adjust or influence internal analytics, decision-
making, and offered products and services;  and
• build employees’ skills and bring innovation 
to the activities that are aligned with net-zero 
objectives. 
Incentives at all levels of the organization should 
be commensurate with the priority of the transition 
plan. They should consider taking into account both 
interim and long-term climate goals.

Example 22. Climate and sustainability measures make up 10% of executive variable pay 
opportunity at  Barclays
Sub-sector: Banking
To reach its ambition to be a net-zero bank by 2050, Barclays is taking a three-pronged approach: 293  
• Achieve net-zero operations. 
• Reduce financed emissions.  
• Finance the transition.
Barclays’ climate and sustainability strategy is reflected in the compensation plans for its executive directors. 294   
The performance measures for each of the 2022 bonus and the 2022 –2024 Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), set 
by the Remuneration Committee of the Barclays PLC Board, include a 10% weighting for climate and sustainability. 
This section primarily focuses on climate-related measures, including:
• progress toward achieving the ambition to be a net-zero bank by 2050;
• alignment of financing with the goals of the Paris Agreement;
• reduction of operational and supply chain carbon footprint and increase use of renewable energy; and
• progress toward green financing  commitments.
 
Example 23. Citi forms governance and business teams to drive its net-zero plan
Sub-sector: Banking
Global bank Citi has committed to achieving net-zero emissions associated with its financing by 2050, which 
involves “rethinking our business and helping our clients rethink theirs.” 295 While the plan is still being formulated, 
Citi’s 2021 TCFD report outlines some aspects already in place. Specifically, the report discusses remuneration and 
employee training and upskilling to demonstrate how roles, responsibilities, and remuneration, as well as skills and 
culture, in line with GFANZ recommendations and guidance, are being considered in the organization.
The management of climate change efforts is considered in Citi’s discretionary incentive compensation program in 
two ways:
• Certain senior executives have performance scorecards that include metrics designated on a position-by-
position basis. Metrics include progress on Citi’s $1 trillion Sustainable Finance Goal and milestones for the 
development of its net-zero plan.
• Climate change strategy and risk management performance goals are incorporated into annual goals and 
performance review processes for several of Citi’s senior managers and their teams who are responsible for 
developing and implementing the approach to climate change.

In addition, Citi is investing in the skills and expertise of its employees. It has established a Net Zero Task Force, led 
by its Chief Sustainability Officer, with leaders from across the business. The task force was formed to collectively 
build knowledge on net zero, inform decisions on methodology, and ensure that information is flowing across 
Citi’s businesses. Additionally, Citi has formed sustainability and transitions teams in the lines of business to share 
expertise and more effectively evaluate and pursue client opportunities. “Through these teams, we have increased 
the climate fluency of our business team leaders, allowing climate considerations to be better integrated into our 
business decision-making,” the company stated in its 2021 TCFD report.
Citi acknowledges that a net-zero target must be translated into policies, procedures, and programs that guide 
sustainable finance operations. While Citi has begun this work, it notes that “we are still developing internal 
processes in several areas, particularly in identifying metrics and performance indicators to demonstrate Citi’s 
progress in achieving the targets in our net-zero plan while simultaneously managing our level of risk and returns 
on our portfolios.”
Example 24. MSCI’s clear roles and responsibilities
Sub-sector: Financial Service Provider
MSCI provides indices, data, and analytics to the financial and investment industry. It has committed to aligning all 
relevant services and products to achieve net-zero GHG emissions by 2050 or sooner. It has also defined one of its 
strategic pillars of growth to “Lead the enablement of ESG and climate investment integration.” 296 As part of this, 
MSCI provides and is further developing a wide range of climate-focused data and analytics products and services.297 
MSCI has established governance processes and structures with clear roles and responsibilities for realizing this 
strategy. In its 2020 TCFD report ,298 it set out a governance and reporting structure that included describing the 
responsibilities of the Board’s standing committees, including the allocation of responsibilities with respect to 
climate change. The Board receives regular updates on MSCI’s net-zero commitment and other climate-related 
initiatives. MSCI also leveraged its in-house expertise around climate science and climate-related solutions to  
inform Board education sessions that strengthened the Board’s foundational knowledge of climate, including on  
net-zero commitments. 299 
Goals related to climate change are also KPIs that factor into the compensation of certain executives. While all its 
executive officers support its climate initiatives, MSCI’s 2022 proxy statement specifically describes actions taken 
by the CEO and the General Counsel to advance MSCI’s climate capabilities and to help clients transition to a 
net-zero world.300 In 2022, all members of the company’s Executive Committee, a committee comprising 23 of the 
company’s senior-most leaders, will include a climate commitment goal in their 2022 individual KPIs that they will 
be assessed against in  2023.

Overview and relevance: Net-zero transition 
plans involve organizational change, with 
potentially significant impacts on business 
lines and employees. Proper skills, training, and 
communication are needed to ensure that plans are 
implemented as designed and implementation risks 
are managed. Implementing a net-zero transition 
will be a multiyear effort and should be designed to 
continue being implemented, regardless of changes 
in the Board and senior management. Therefore, 
adoption of the plan requires a commitment 
to culture change, communication, broader 
training for employees, and innovation across the 
financial institution.
Guidance: Financial institutions should provide 
support required for individuals to perform their 
assigned roles in designing and implementing 
transition plans. 
Organizations should consider conducting 
assessments to determine if key individuals have 
the required skills and knowledge appropriate to 
their role. Roles range from strategic oversight 
301 Specific transition skills may include building familiarity with accepted sustainability standards, which will vary based on the 
financial institution’s type, geography, and jurisdiction and may include frameworks like the European Union’s Taxonomy, the U.S.  
Securities and Exchange Commission’s proposed rules on climate disclosure, or the Science Based Targets initiative’s guidance for 
the financial sector. Another example of transition skills and training could be technical competency around scenario analysis and 
science-based transition  pathways.
of the net-zero transition plan from the Board, 
strategy oversight bodies, and senior management 
to day-to-day plan execution by employees. 
Financial institutions should consider providing 
ongoing and relevant training at every level of the 
organization, including the highest strategic levels, 
and transparent processes should be in place to 
assess and improve skills and knowledge gaps. 
Organizations may also want to consider making 
skills and training accessible to key vendors and 
value chain partners. 301 
All levels of the institution should have access to 
external climate experts and resources for deep 
technical knowledge as appropriate and as internal 
teams start to build their climate skills. Teams may 
need to be kept abreast of new developments in 
science and industry and such resources should be 
refreshed, as needed.  
An ambitious net-zero transition plan requires an 
organization-wide reorientation and culture change. 
As part of a change program, the institution 
should consider building broader awareness and 
understanding of the transition plan, so employees 
throughout the organization understand how and 
why the institution is adapting its business; what 
is expected of them; and how they can contribute. 
Employees could be engaged and educated on the 
transition plan through initiatives like employee 
engagement surveys, and integrated learning 
plans. Employee skill sets could be assessed in 
performance evaluations and interviews. Awareness 
and understanding will facilitate integration of the 
transition objectives into decision-making across 
the organization and help create employee buy-in 
at all levels.
Recommendation
Provide training and development support 
to the teams and individuals designing, 
implementing, and overseeing the plan so 
that they have sufficient skills and knowledge 
to perform their roles (including at the Board 
and senior management level). Implement 
a change management program and foster 
open communications to embed the net-zero 
transition plan into the organization’s culture 
and practices.

“All staff need to have a solid understanding of the 
overall strategy and the specific role that they play in 
contributing to success.”
“Training should be integrated with work functions 
and processes instead of being treated as a one-off

and innovators.”
“Sustainability and ESG leads will need to support 
the process along with people who are skilled in 
change management.”
Investor Agenda ICAPs 303  
“Education and training can be done in-house, 
preferably in collaboration with experts in 
relevant aspects of sustainability risks or in offsite 
sessions conducted by established programs. The 
competencies and capabilities of the Board, senior 
management and investment teams should be 
formally and annually assessed with the results  
and criteria for assessment  disclosed.”
 
A net-zero transition will require considerable change and innovation across the organization. Some ways 
that people managers can support employees through this change  include:
• identify challenges that arise as opportunities to deepen dialogue with the teams;
• encourage diverse views and difficult conversations as a way to build understanding;
• update senior management on metrics and data that show progress (in addition to completed 
milestones) to integrate transition understanding among  teams;
• facilitate clear communication from senior management and the Board or strategy oversight body on 
climate strategy, scopes, and net-zero targets; and
• create cross-departmental teams or networks to facilitate reflection on transition plan implementation, 
including individuals’ concerns and perspectives on the transition.

has joined NZBA and has also announced interim Scope 3 emissions targets for key sectors. 308 TD’s ESG strategy 
is coordinated across the bank and increasingly integrated into its business as usual practices, including through 
the establishment of its Climate TOM and ESG COE, which have been mobilized to deliver on and embed TD’s ESG 
strategy throughout the organization. 309 
TD’s Climate TOM represents an important step toward implementing the actions necessary to reduce the bank’s 
GHG emissions, further embed enterprise climate-related risk management practices into its business activities, 
and capitalize on climate-related opportunities. 310 The Climate TOM is a framework that outlines how functions,

objectives of the enterprise’s Climate Action Plan. 311 TD developed its Climate TOM and roadmap 312 working with 
TD stakeholders to assess the bank’s “current state” practice relative to agreed “target state” capabilities, identify 
the actions necessary to reach the “target state,” and outline the roles and responsibilities of the various teams 
involved in the implementation. The roadmap describes key milestones TD is focused on achieving over a three-  
to four-year period to build the required climate capabilities and supporting infrastructure. 313 
The ESG COE and Climate TOM work very closely together. The COE was created in 2021 to bring together the 
experience, expertise, and talent of colleagues working on ESG issues across the enterprise. 314 TD uses both a 
top-down and bottom-up approach to embedding ESG within its business and culture, in addition to focusing 
on educating leadership in key ESG areas to support alignment across the enterprise. The ESG COE coordinates 
expanding ESG expertise, including understanding climate change, within TD’s lines of business. 315 The ESG 
COE also facilitates coordination and knowledge-sharing across key areas including research, policies, risk 
management, sustainable financing, and reporting. 316 
TD has also linked senior executive compensation with the bank’s ESG performance, further reinforcing the 
importance of ESG as a core component of TD’s business strategy and future. 317 These factors further demonstrate 
TD’s commitment toward creating a culture where colleagues can contribute to and are responsible for advancing 
the enterprise’s Climate Action Plan.

knowledge of how best to support clients in reaching net zero. 
It has created an online ESG (environmental, social, and governance), Climate, and Sustainable Finance college 
that is available to all teammates. 319 The aim of the training is to deepen employees’ understanding of the primary 
decarbonization strategies for individual sectors and the financing solutions Bank of America can offer to assist 
clients in their net-zero transition. These training initiatives focus on developing skills and knowledge to help 
enable employees, managers, and teams across lines of business with the design and implementation of products 
and services that will support the acceleration of the transition to net zero.

The way forward
GFANZ offers the recommendations and guidance 
in this report to support financial institutions as 
they develop their net-zero transition plans with 
a focus on delivering real-economy emissions 
reductions in line with net-zero commitments. 
Developing and implementing a credible transition 
plan in line with these recommendations supports 
institutions in their efforts to operationalize 
their commitments.

Allocation of capital and services to net-zero ﬁnancing
This report is being published at a time when 
the financial sector’s approach toward net zero, 
including net-zero transition plans (NZTPs), is 
quickly evolving. The TCFD provided a framework 
for disclosing how climate-related risks and 
opportunities can be material to financial returns. 
Supporting financial sector commitments to net 
zero that reflect the pledges from governments 
and real-economy firms, GFANZ is expanding 
on the work of the TCFD with resources on the 
development of NZTPs. Despite challenges, 
membership in the sector-specific net-zero

alliances is increasing and financial institutions are 
developing and implementing NZTPs, pointing to 
increased commitment and action to realize those 
commitments. Figure  22 sets out an illustrative path 
for how NZTPs could mature in the industry over 
the next five years.
Realization of this path will require the widespread 
adoption of NZTPs by financial institutions. 
To enable this adoption, the financial sector 
requires increased availability of high-quality 
transition-related data and transition plans 
from real-economy firms; the improvement and 
harmonization of transition planning methodologies 
from target setting to reporting standards; and 
near-term action by policymakers.
Overall, transition plan implementation should 
increase financial flows toward the four key 
financing strategies outlined in this report, 
ultimately supporting the real-economy net-
zero transition. Over time, the ratio of allocation 
between transition finance versus clients and 
portfolio companies who do not fall under the key 
financing strategies is expected to evolve as the 
real-economy transition progresses. For example, 
there could be a larger allocation to “climate 
solutions” as opportunities related to solutions 
expand in number and scale; greater attention 
and allocation to “managed phaseout” as the 
practice becomes mainstream; and expansion in 
the “aligning” and “aligned” categories as more 
real-economy, net-zero commitments are made and 
implemented. Eventually, net-zero considerations 
should become systemically embedded across the 
financial sector.
To achieve this, GFANZ encourages financial 
institutions to heed the guidance in this report and 
their net-zero, sector-specific alliance by developing 
and implementing NZTPs and evaluating their 
strategies against the four key financing strategies. 
Real-economy firms would also benefit from 
setting net-zero commitments and developing 
ambitious NZTPs, given the scale of the financial 
sector’s commitment to net-zero alignment. For 
policymakers, establishing clear and consistent 
policy around transition-related disclosures could 
catalyze action at the scale needed to realize the 
ambition of the Paris Agreement. Cooperation 
between all key stakeholders is critical to accelerate 
widespread development and implementation of 
NZTPs in support of achieving net zero and limiting 
warming to 1.5 degrees C.
