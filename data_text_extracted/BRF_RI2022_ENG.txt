GRI 2-2, 2-3, 2-4, 2-5, 2-14
This document presents the next steps on our journey 
in communicating our results, focusing on informing our 
stakeholders of our projects, investments, strategies and key 
performance indicators in both the financial and non-finan-
cial areas.
This report covers the period from January 1st to December 
31st, 2022, including all of our operations in Brazil and in in-
ternational markets (factories, farms, distribution centers, in-
novation, and commercial and corporate offices) - the same 
entities outlined in the Financial Statements. The sustain-
ability indicators encompass a wide range of topics across 
our supply chain, including food quality and safety, animal 
welfare development of our human capital, actions taken to 
tackle climate change and responsibility in the value chain. 
When applicable, the sections that present different data 
for companies are highlighted in the text and the different 
approaches are described in the footnotes of the standards.
As in previous years, as references for this report we have 
adopted the most recent version (2021) of the Global Re-
porting Initiative (GRI) Standards; the Integrated Reporting 
guidelines of the IFRS Foundation; and the reporting stan-
dards established by the Sustainability Accounting Standards 
Board (SASB). We also reference our commitments and 
actions connected to the United Nations’ Sustainable Devel-
opment Goals (SDGs) and the Global Pact, to which we have 
been signatories since 2007.
The economic-financial data is tied to our financial state-
ments, available here, and adhere to both Brazilian stan-
dards and the International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS), in accordance with the standards of the Brazilian 
Securities Commission (CVM) and the US Security Exchange 
Commission (SEC). There have been no cases of restatement 
of information. The veracity of the data has been ensured 
by an independent external audit, performed by KPMG, and 
approved by the Executive Board and the Administrative 
Council.
Other market references that we take into consideration are 
the requirements made by indexes including the Corporate 
Sustainability Index (ISE) established by the Brazilian stock 
exchange (B3) and the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, as 
well as the criteria of the Brazilian Association of Publicly Held 
Companies (Abrasca). Our senior management assumes full 
responsibility for , and approves, this report, just as it strives 
for the correct application of the integrated thought-process 
underlying the conception and structuring of the document. 
The structure of the report aims to present our strategic 
vision and the key-topics in the perception of our stakehold-
ers - including suppliers, employees, management, clients, 
consumers, communities and regulatory agencies - as identi-
fied through a new materiality process. It also expresses the 
commitments and pillars of the BRF Sustainability Plan with 
its concrete results outlined in the relevant chapter .
We aim to construct relations guided by our commitment to 
Integrity, Quality and Safety, with this report being published 
as an important instrument in terms of our accountability. In 
the event of any doubts, suggestions or observations con-
cerning the 2022 Integrated Report, please contact us by

Report and Materiality 
GRI 2-29, 3-1, 3-2
In line with the GRI Standards, and the best practices 
for reporting and stakeholder engagement, we have 
updated our Materiality Matrix, using the Double Ma-
teriality methodology. 
The perspective taken by double materiality takes a 
combined look at the impacts caused by the business 
to society and the environment and also at the ex-
ternal aspects that have the power to influence our 
process of value creation.
To do so, we have identified stakeholders who are 
responsible for indicating and supporting the process 
of refining the list of topics, a process that involves 
stages such as the prioritization of topics, analysis and 
validation.
BRF materiality: variables analyzed
Socio-environmental impact
• topic: social and environmental impacts of the 
business
•  investment from the perspective of specialists 
(internal and external)
• assessment of magnitude  and scope
Financial impact
•  topic: the risks and channels involved in the 
business’ financial impacts
•  investigated from the perspective of analysts 
(executives and capital providers)
• risk assessment (probability and magnitude)
Relevance to the stakeholders
•  topic: general, objective and agnostic description (positive 
and negative)
•  investigated considering the perception of impact on the 
stakeholders (relevance)
•  consolidated assessment, considered by importance 
(frequency, dependence and influence)

Identification and analysis of 
contexts:  
we develop analyses of sector documents, 
studies, publications and internal corporate 
policies. 
Performance of consultations (priori-
tization):  
following this, we study the socio-environmental and 
financial perspectives as well as the relevance of the topics 
to the different publics. To do so, we created three groups 
to conduct the process of public consultation. The first was 
focused on an analysis of the financial materiality, involving 
9 interviews with BRF’s senior management, 5 with inves-
tors and financial institutions, and 23 online consultations. 
We also held 6 meetings with managers and specialists, 
during which we assessed the probability of the perceived 
risks for each topic as well as the magnitude of the associ-

socio-environmental materiality, involving 6 interviews 
with external specialists, and 77 online consultations 
with internal and external specialists. In the third group-
ing, focused on perception of the relevance, we collected 
another 3,006 responses to the digital consultation 
provided by clients, suppliers, service providers, employ-
ees, integrated producers, NGOs, the press and sector 
associations.

Report
Message from our 
leadership GRI 2-22
Marcos Molina  
Chairman of the Board of Directors
2022 was a year of intense transformation for BRF. 
The Company started the year under the impacts of 
important global, geopolitical factors, such as the war 
in Ukraine, economic uncertainties, and volatility in the 
market. As of March, with the formation of a new Board 
of Directors, we began a detailed and careful analysis 
of our business. Although the year’s financial results do 
not demonstrate BRF’s maximum potential, we man-
aged to move forward with the foundations that will 
firmly pave the way for a new chapter in the Company’s 
history. But this would not be possible without the ded-
ication of the almost 100,000 people who work with us 
every day. With enormous discipline in the execution, 
agility, simplicity and efficiency of their work, we are 
certain that we will resume our efficiency and profitabil-
ity.
One of the first steps on this new journey has been to 
direct all of our internal efforts towards BRF’s core busi-
ness through a strong efficiency plan. We have taken 
numerous measures, throughout the value chain, aim-
ing to optimize the allocation of capital in a careful and 
orderly manner . Between September and December , by 
improving our operational indicators, reducing costs 
relating to inactivity, and simplifying our innovation 
portfolio, we captured R$ 210 million, with our non-ne-
gotiable commitment to Safety, Quality and Integrity 
always guiding the way. 
At the close of 2022 , the Company’s net revenue 
achieved R$ 53.8 billion, an increase of 11.3% com-
pared to the previous year , with results arising from our 
work designed to grow in products with added value 
and expand our presence in international markets. To 
increase our results in Brazil, we have simplified our 
portfolio, improved our commercial execution, and 
increased the presence of our brands at points of sale, 
which continues to be one of our main strengths. In the 
Halal market Sadia and Banvit, already leaders in their 
markets, grew even more in terms of market share and 
items of added value. 
We have strengthened our export platform, with new 
plant approvals for countries including Canada, Mexico, 
Japan and South Africa, reflecting the confidence that 
the authorities in these countries have in the safety and 
reliability of our production chain. In the international 
market, we inaugurated a new plant in Saudi Arabia, 
thus expanding our local production.  
On the EESG agenda, we consolidated important 
advances in sustainability and in the improvement of 
our governance standards. For the 16th year , we were 
recognized by

the market for our practices, maintaining our position 
in the B3 ISE portfolio. In striving for a chain free of 
deforestation, we implemented the traceability of 100% 
our direct grain suppliers and 45% of our indirect grain 
suppliers in the Amazon and Cerrado biomes. And re-
inforcing our pioneering drive in animal welfare, we ful-
filled our public commitment to end surgical castration 
in the swine herd. In relation to the challenge of climate 
change, we began a journey to accomplish our Sustain-
ability Plan’s targets for the reduction of greenhouse 
gas emissions using ‘FLAG’ methodology, with valida-
tion from the  Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) 
and advances in the mapping of Scope 3 emissions, 
both of which are requirements for us to move closer to 
achieving our commitment to be Net Zero by 2040. 
These advances have only been possible due to the en-
gagement of our team Despite all these challenges, we 
have continued investing in our internal development 
programs, in career paths, and in our policy of actively 
listening to our stakeholders to be able to improve our 
processes and keep alive the pride in being BRF, that 
thousands of employees feel around the world. 
This process of transformation, initiated in 2022, has 
been essential to ensuring that BRF’s bases for evolu-
tion can firmly support all the potential that this com-
pany has to offer . We remain committed to consistently 
maximizing our results as time goes on. We are focused 
on successfully performing our efficiency plan and 
working simply and dynamically on our business deci-
sions with the aim of delivering the best results for our 
shareholders, clients, integrated partners, employees 
and communities.

We serve thousands of clients around the world, and 
have expanded our business for almost 90 years of work 
dedicated to food production. Our chain ranges from the 
animals, a task performed by more than 9,500 partner 
producers, to the slaughter and industrial manufacturing, 
logistics and delivery at the points of sale.  
The focus of our business strategy is the domestic mar-
kets in Brazil, as well as the Halal and international mar-
kets, especially in the Middle East and Asia.  With admin-
istrative head offices in Brazil, we operate 38 industrial 
units in this country and another 6 in other countries, 
as well as more than 50 distribution centers. The supply 
chain involves around 30,000 partners (head offices and 
branches) responsible for the consumables, technolo-
gy and services that are essential for the success of our 
business.
In 2022, we overhauled our shareholding structure, with 
control of the Company moving into the hands of a single 
shareholder . We have continued our efforts in the area 
of deleveraging and operational efficiency, both of which 
are essential for overcoming macroeconomic and sector 
challenges, without losing sight of our fundamental com-
mitments or our Sustainability Plan, made up of 22 public 
commitments. We have also reviewed our portfolio of 
projects and investments in innovation, advancing in our 
commitments in the areas of energy, decarbonization and 
animal welfare, in line with our material topics concerning 
sustainability.
 We pay a great deal of attention to all those who con-
tribute to building BRF’s history on a daily basis. We aim 
to promote a plural culture, which benefits from the 89 
nationalities that make up our team, and to invest in gov-
ernance, management and processes in all areas of the 
company, with a focus on results. In 2022, we emphasized 
the aspects of simplicity, agility and efficiency as key-ele-
ments in the day-to-day construction of our Culture.
We have almost 100 thousand employees 
working to offer quality, tasty and practical 
foods to consumers in more than 100 countries

At BRF we adopt mechanisms, structures and processes 
designed to guarantee a governance model that follows 
Brazilian and international best practices As a compa-
ny listed on the B3 ‘Novo Mercado’ (Brazilian Stock Ex-
change), as well as having Level III ADRs traded on the 
New York Stock Exchange, we meet the requirements 
of the capitals market and work to ensure that the deci-
sion-making processes are guided by integrity and profes-
sionalism, as well as clear and responsible policies.
In 2021, Marfrig Global Food S.A. purchased shares in 
the company, consequently increasing its shareholding 
interest in BRF, with control being formalized following 
the election of the new Board of Directors in 2022. With 
expertise and extensive operations in the global food 
industry, the company has confirmed its contribution of 
knowledge and understanding of the market at levels 
such as the Board of Directors, which, in August 2022, 
elected Miguel de Souza Gularte, as the new CEO of BRF.
This process, which represented the revision and ad-
vancement of the actions taken to improve the Compa-
ny's results, also involved a redefinition of the structure 
of the senior executive management, with alterations to 
the functions and scope of BRF’s global vice-presidencies 
and respective boards, preparing the company for a new 
growth cycle.
We are working to increase the collective knowledge 
and mobilization of our board members and executives 
in relation to the Company's EESG agenda. This was a 
central focus in 2022, involving senior management in the 
process of revising the materiality and reformulating the 
scope of the Sustainability Committee, which is fully dedi-
cated to the growing connection between our Sustainabil-
ity Plan and the Company’s business vision.
In 2022, BRF signed a Leniency Agreement with the 
Federal Comptroller General and the Federal Attorney 
General's Office. The Agreement was the result of a close 
and detailed internal investigation process performed by 
the Company, starting in 2018, with support from inde-
pendent external advisors, aiming to identify behavior 
practiced by employees of the Company in the past. Over 
the past few years, this investigation process has culmi-
nated in a series of administrative measures, including 
the dismissal of employees involved in the illegal practices 
identified; improvement of the Company’s corporate gov-
ernance and integrity system; voluntary cooperation with 
Brazilian and foreign authorities; and negotiations aimed 
at the signing of the Agreement.
With the signing of the Agreement, BRF  has promised to 
pay the Brazilian authorities R$ 583.9 million in penalties 
arising from past conduct. It has also promised to dedi-
cate itself to improving its Integrity System as a means of 
perfecting the work focused on Integrity and Transparen-
cy that is already under way.

We are formally engaged in the issue of anti-bribery: we 
were the first company in the sector to obtain the ISO 
37001 management system certification
Ethics and compliance 
GRI 3-3: Material Topic (Human rights and labor relations; Ethics, 
integrity and compliance; Management, transparency and traceability of 
the supply chain), 2-15, 2-23, 2-24, 2-25, 2-26
At BRF, the autonomous and independent Compliance 
Department, supported by senior management, is respon-
sible for coordinating and guaranteeing the ongoing im-
provement of the Company's System of Integrity, aiming to 
ensure and disseminate a culture of ethics and transparency 
throughout the Company, from the senior management to 
the employees at the operational units.
Over recent years, the Company’s Integrity System has expe-
rienced important improvements and efforts are now con-
centrated in its eight pillars. The topic of ethics, integrity and 
compliance is material for BRF, having been stressed by the 
stakeholders in the consultation and engagement processes 
undertaken in 2022 (read more on page xx), with indicators 
and metrics that include training in use of the Transparen-
cy Guide and anti-corruption procedures; management 
systems such as the ISO 37001; due diligence and auditing 
of the different departments; and response measures and 
investigation of potential impacts and risks.
The senior management, represented by the Audit and 
Integrity Committee, is responsible for supervising BRF’s 
Integrity System, monitoring the progress of investigations 
and suggesting the application of improvements in the 
processes. The Transparency Committee (composed of the 
CEO, CFO, Institutional, Legal and Compliance Vice-President, 
and Vice-President of Personnel, Sustainability and Digital 
Operations) is also responsible for proposing actions for the 
dissemination and fulfillment of the Transparency Guide and 
the Integrity System policies, as well as ensuring the effective-
ness of the system and compliance by all BRF employees. We 
openly and regularly communicate our compliance hotline, 
not only to our employees, but to all our stakeholders. Any 
eventual improvements arising from the messages received 
via this Channel are reported to the Transparency Committee 
and the Audit and Integrity Committee on a quarterly basis.
The effectiveness of the tool is monitored by means of 
feedback to the users, protocols for the receipt of reports, 
and monitoring and conclusion of the issues classified as 
“justified” or “unjustified”. The performance indicators are 
published annually by the Compliance Department.
We base all of BRF’s operations on the Transparency Guide 
which has recently been reviewed (the latest version has 
been current since January 1, 2021) and periodic dissemina-
tion to all employees throughout our markets. As well as this 
we have a set of policies and procedures (see the table on the 
following page) that address the topics relating to integrity 
by the Compliance Board, and which is applied to all BRF’s 
employees and partners. 
The Transparency Guide addresses issues that cover the 
entire business, such as human rights, diversity, conflict 
of interest, tackling corruption and bribery, data privacy, 
and guidance on the use of the transparency channel. The 
document meets the requirements and specifications of 
applicable Brazilian and international legislation and publicly 
establishes BRF’s management of compliance. We are signa-
tories to the Business Pact for Integrity and Fighting Corrup-
tion and comply with the annual commitments arising from 
the signing of the agreement with the cited Institution. The 
signing performed at the BRF head office (in Santa Catarina) 
covers all the group’s legal entities.
The topic of conflict of interest is addressed through training 
sessions, as well as management policies, and contains basic 
regulations for the operations of the Company's employees 
and managers. In our CORPORATE CONFLICT OF INTEREST 
Policy, we have a section on “Procedure for declaration in the 
event of a conflict of interest”, that focuses on the approach 
and handling of cases of this nature. This document can be 
accessed here.
We pay special attention to the topics of anti-corruption and 
anti-bribery, in order to guarantee the proper conduct of all 
our directors, employees and business partners in business 
transactions or relations with public authorities, the private 
sector or society as a whole. 
In order to maintain our ISO 37001 certification, inspection 
audits were performed in 2021 and 2022, demonstrating the 
robustness of BRF’s Integrity System in its human, financial 
and technological resources related to anti-bribery practices.
This concern also extends to the process of contracting third 
parties, in which our Compliance Board performs reputa-
tional analyses of partners in hirings that could possibly be 
of high risk to the business, involving consultations of official 
public blacklists, court processes and the media. The pro-
cess is also crucial in cases of mergers and acquisitions, in 
which careful assessments of the employees examine the 
history, practices and compliance of potential companies,

within the sphere of M&A projects. In terms of competition 
practices, we have a management policy specifically ad-
dressing this matter .
The issue of human rights involves our analysis of potential 
and real impacts and of the practices established in the 
Integrity System and in the Company's risk management 
procedures, this having been highlighted in the materiality 
process and the stakeholder consultation and engagement 
process. We have a corporate policy dedicated to the issue 
and, in both our own operations and in those of our sup-
pliers, we observe the risks associated with labor practices 
comparable to slavery, child labor and degrading work 
conditions. The Transparency Guide directly addresses the 
issue. 
In 2022, we performed periodic assessments of categories 
concerning “anti-ethical conduct” and “anti-competition, 
corruption, export control, money laundering and violation 
of human rights”, in our three operations, or in other words, 
100% of the total, and we pay close attention to risks such 
as non-compliance with the Brazilian Anti-Corruption Law 
and related regulations, as well as the directives of our In-
tegrity System. GRI 205-1
In 2022, no public court cases relating to corruption were 
filed against BRF or our employees, and nor were any con-
tracts with our business partners rescinded. Neither were 
there any legal actions for unfair competition, anti-trust or 
monopoly practices. Under the Leniency Agreement, the 
terms are detailed in the Corporate Governance chapter .

Transparency channel
We have a Transparency channel designed to record any sus-
pected breaches of ethics and integrity as well as any alerts to 
such, which is made available to all interested parties. We have 
a specialist company taking care of this channel and a process 
that allows the complainant (employees or individuals outside 
BRF) to contact us via telephone, e-mail or our website, with 
anonymity being assured in accordance with the wishes of the 
person making contact. 
The channel is available 24/7, and is offered in the dominant 
languages spoken in the regions where we are present around 
the world. The responsible departments are immediately 
engaged to investigate each event, with confidentiality being 
assured in relation to the information communicated during 
the investigation process, with full respect being paid to all data 
protection legislation. 
The Compliance Board is the body responsible for investigating 
all accusations received through the BRF Transparency chan-
nel with all operations based upon the premises of legality, 
equality and transparency, and non-retaliation. In the event of 
an accusation involving a member of senior management or 
the Compliance Department itself, such cases are analyzed by 
the Audit and Integrity Committee or by the Board of Directors, 
depending upon each specific case.
The board responsible monitors weekly indicators on the 
efficacy of the channel, including the number of open, resolved 
and pending accusations. The lengths of time taken to resolve 
the complaints made through the channel are also monitored, 
as are any possible remedies or penalties applied following the 
investigations (to find out more about the management of this 
topic, access the Transparency Report here).
In 2022, the cases listed on this page were registered and 
addressed.

Training & Dissemination GRI 2-24, 205-2
During the year , we maintained our communications on 
the issues of ethics, integrity, anti-corruption and an-
ti-bribery to every one of the members of our Board of 
Directors and Supervisory Board, as well as the members 
of the Advisory Committees and employees around the 
world.
We also worked on raising the awareness of our business 
partners, including providing training for them on the 
BRF Business Partners’ Code of Conduct, and communi-
cation on the policies that make up the Integrity System, 
through the use of various channels. 
Another essential engagement action involved the Integ-
rity Ambassadors program. In 2022, we had 303 profes-
sionals located in every one of our units around the world 
working on communication and awareness raising actions 
focused on ethics and integrity. More than 100 of them 
were nominated and specifically trained during the year , 
with 77% of them being drawn from the operational and 
administrative levels and 23% from management. 
Over the course of the year , we also revised and created 
new Integrity Guidelines, providing orientations on spe-
cific situations, to provide support for  our employees and 
management. These guidelines appeared in the discus-
sions held during target checking meetings, exchanges 
between groups and at other moments in the Company's 
day-to-day activities. At the end of the year , we put togeth-
er a book containing 52 guidelines, which was presented 
to the ambassadors for use in communication actions in 
2023.
During 2022, we expanded our 
Integrity Ambassadors Program 
and created Integrity Guidelines, 
taking a light and accessible 
approach.

Tax management GRI 207-1, 207- 207
We pursue a tax management policy that adheres to a set 
of management directives and our tax management poli-
cy (find out more here). The Company's actions concerning 
this issue are aligned with the office of the responsible 
vice-president, the Board of Directors and the advisory 
committees. Amongst these entities, the Tax Committee is 
responsible for deciding upon those matters that involve 
risks, tax planning, adhesion and amnesties, decisions on 
actions in the sphere of tax litigation, the impact of new 
legislation and other tax-related matters that involve a 
risk to the Company's image or which could have reper-
cussions in the Civil or Criminal spheres. The Board of 
Directors, meanwhile, operates as the highest governing 
body, approving the organization’s operations. 
We operate in line with all international and local tax 
legislation. In order to ensure legal compliance, we have 
independent auditors review our taxes once every quarter . 
Aware of the impact that taxes have on the economic sce-
nario, our tax strategy is guided by principles of transpar-
ency and integrity.  The Tax Board analyzes and manages 
the tax impacts of our current and future commercial op-
erations and transactions, based upon business logic and 
taking into account a long-term vision of sustainability 
connected to the company's different areas of business.
All reports relating to anti-ethical concerns or behavior 
are addressed to the Compliance team via the Trans-
parency channel which can be accessed not only by the 
Company's employees, but also by third parties (partners, 
suppliers, clients, etc.) and are made available on the BRF 
Transparency channel website (canalconfidencial.com.

The process is reviewed whenever any type of opera-
tional procedure that may be liable to tax investigation 
is observed. The Management of Tax Compliance is also 
involved in projects developed by the Company's different 
departments, with the intention of analyzing the process 
and identifying any possible risk, proposing improve-
ments and the best way of correcting the situation. 
Analysis is performed by means of an assessment of the 
Tax Board’s SOx and NSOx controls, a review performed 
by the external auditors (which report any possible risks 
identified in the form of a report called an ‘Internal Con-
trols Letter’), as well as by means of reports obtained from 
the ‘Big 4’ companies and law firms contracted to provide 
legal opinions on the potential risks and the best means 
of mitigating them.

Risk 
management and 
opportunities GRI 2-12, 
2-23, 2-24
We have a risk management model aligned with best 
market practices. As such, we have adopted as a base 
the ISO 31000 international norm, the framework 
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations 
of the Treadway Commission (Coso), and the model 
proposed by the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA), 
that suggests governance organized along three lines 
(see the organizational chart).
The directives and responsibilities of the process of 
risk management are formalized in our Corporate Risk 
Management Policy (PGRC), approved by the Board of 
Directors and published on our corporate governance 
portal (bylaws and policies). 
The Board of Directors plays a fundamental role in the 
development of BRF’s risk management culture, as 
well as in the maintenance of a strong process of inte-
grated risk management. It should also be mentioned 
that the Board of Directors is continually supported 
by the respective advisory committees: Finance and 
Risk Management Committee (CFGR) and Audit and 
Integrity Committee (CAI).
MANAGEMENT
1ST LINE 
The first line is made up of the 
Risk Holders (Vice-Presidents and 
the reports coming directly from 
their respective areas); the Focus 
Points (employees pinpointed by 
the Risk Holders to be the point 
of contact within their team for 
the Risk Management Board); and 
those employees participating in 
the actions focused on training and 
dissemination of risk culture at BRF.
2ND LINE
The second line consists of the 
Global Risk Management Board, 
responsible for establishing 
methodologies, directives and the 
risk management process, as well 
as providing ongoing monitoring 
of the evolution of risks. This level 
reports periodically to Comex, the 
Advisory Committees and the Board 
of Directors.
AUDITING
3RD LINE
The third line is provided by 
the Global Internal Auditing 
Board, which is responsible 
for periodically providing 
independent, impartial 
evaluations of the management 
of the risks and the governance 
processes.

Furthermore, the Executive Committee (Comex) operates 
directly with the Company's risk management, its princi-
pal responsibilities including, but not limited to: 
•  Supporting the PGRC and promoting the culture of 
risk management; 
• Assessing the risks and defining how they should be 
addressed (response), adopting actions for their proper 
mitigation and minimization of exposure; 
•  Establishing and monitoring the internal control 
system; and 
•  Monitoring the priority indicators and risk mitigation 
strategies.
Just as important as the roles and responsibilities listed 
above, BRF also clearly defines where the risks lie and 
how the risk management process should be continuous-
ly applied, with the aim of ensuring that the pre-estab-
lished directives are fulfilled and the Company's risks are 
effectively managed. 
 All the governance described is led by the Global Risks 
Department, which has a mandate to ensure the proper 
and immediate management of the risks to which the 
Company is exposed, as well as assume responsibility 
for the due communication to, and training of, all those 
involved. 
All the risks are evaluated and classified according to their 
impact and likelihood of materializing and are consolidat-
ed in the Risk Map, which is revised periodically and de-
livered to the management team, the Board of Directors, 
and their advisory committees. 
Finally, the risk management is systematically monitored 
by the management team, which supports the perfor-
mance of the actions designed to reduce the Company's 
levels of exposure. 
BRF’s risk management process covers 
the identification, analysis, assessment, 
handling, reporting and ongoing monitoring 
of the identified issues

We continue moving forward with the actions forming 
part of our Maturity in Risk Management Plan, focus-
ing on improving the digitalization processes, and 
guaranteeing the ongoing updating of the Risks Map, 
together with our sustainability commitments and 
business vision, whilst also reinforcing the connection 
of interdependence between the different factors to 
which we are exposed due to the nature of the busi-
ness, our global presence (subject to many different 
norms and regulations), and the relationship between 
financial and non-financial aspects in the success of 
our strategy.
Over recent years, we have been monitoring differ-
ent topics that are directly and indirectly linked to the 
continuity and longevity of the business, including 
sanitary and technical restrictions, possible epidemics, 
data protection, tax, exchange and political-economic 
issues, and, in relation to EESG matters, climate as-
pects and regulatory environmental compliance.

Principal risks and opportunities 
Below is a list of the leading categories and types of risk to which we are 
exposed: As in previous years, we are presenting this in relation to the 
capitals accessed and transformed by the Company; their nature; and our 
measures concerning the response, mitigation and control as well as the 
associated opportunities.
Sanitary and technical restrictions    
SASB FB-MP-250a.4, GRI 3-3: Material Topic (Quality and safety of the 
products)
Affected capitals:  
Social capital and Natural capital
What is the risk?  
Outbreaks, or the fear of outbreaks, of any diseases 
amongst the animals can lead to the cancellation of 
orders from our clients and lead to negative publicity that 
could result in having an adverse material effect on the 
consumer demand for our products. Furthermore, out-
breaks of animal diseases in Brazil can result in actions 
taken by foreign governments to close export markets.
How do we manage this?  
In the global arena, the sanitary perspective also poses 
the risk of embargoes. African swine fever in some coun-
tries in the Americas brings with it the risk of closure of 
markets in case of an outbreak in Brazilian territories. Es-
pecially in the last few months of 2022 and the beginning 
of 2023, the region of the Americas saw an increase in the 
cases of bird flu in countries such as Canada, the United 
States, Mexico, Argentina, Uruguay, Colombia, Chile, Vene-
zuela and Peru. There is no certainty as to how the mar-
kets will react to any possible positive cases confirmed in 
Brazil, but it is important to stress that the country does 
not suffer from the disease.
What opportunities exist?  
The quality and safety of the foods are non-negotiable 
assets that form an integral part of our strategy and man-
agement system, and which run through our entire value 
chain. We believe that the main strategy for the preven-
tion and control of sanitary issues lies in biosafety being 
effectively applied in all links of the chain. 
Food quality and safety  
GRI 3-3: Material Topic (Quality and safety of the products)
Affected capitals:  
Social capital and Natural capital 
 
What is the risk?  
Food health and safety risks relating to our business and 
the food industry as a whole can adversely affect our 
production and transportation processes, as well as our 
ability to sell our products.
How do we manage this?  
The quality and safety of the 
foods are non-negotiable 
assets that are part of our 
strategy and management 
system, and which run through 
our entire value chain.

BRF has established three commitments: Safety, Quality 
and Integrity. The Quality Policy establishes our commit-
ment to the quality and safety of our foods, the priority 
given to meeting all the legal requirements, and satis-
fying the needs of our clients and consumers. We have 
Corporate Regulations that standardize all the processes 
relating to quality at our production units. Furthermore, 
through our excellence programs such as ‘SEO’, ‘More 
Excellence’ and ‘Ideal Store’, we have strengthened ful-
fillment of the standards defined in the company's dif-
ferent departments, advancing how non-compliance is 
addressed for the continued improvement of the BRF 
quality system. Indeed, this improvement is strengthened 
by means of internal and external audits, with the inter-
nal ones evaluating the adherence of the internal proce-
dures to legal requirements and client and certification 
standards (undertaken annually by the Corporate Quality 
Assurance Department), whilst the external ones consider 
the internationally recognized GFSI standards.
BRF’s units hold a number of quality certificates includ-
ing BRC, IFS, Global-GAP , AloFree, Certified Humane and 
ISO17025, amongst other considered as being distinc-
tions in the market. In addition to this, BRF is audited 
externally by different markets and clients, as well as the 
relevant Brazilian organs, such as the Ministry of Agri-
culture, Livestock and Supply (MAPA) and the National 
Sanitary Surveillance Agency (ANVISA).
Exchange and political-economic risks
Affected capital: Financial capital
What is the risk?  
The geopolitical challenges and uncertainties arising due 
to the military conflict taking place between Russia and 
Ukraine could have an adverse material effect on the glob-
al economy, logistics, and the prices of certain materials 
and commodities as well as our businesses. Over recent 
years, the macroeconomic scenario has been extremely 
challenging, with field variation, increasing inflation and 
the high interest rate. The year 2022 closed with the basic 
interest rate (Selic) at 13.75%, the highest it has been 
since January 2017. This scenario of high interest rates 
and the Brazilian Real still being highly devalued (with the 
dollar closing the year worth around R$ 5.3, against R$ 5.4 
at the end of 2021) presents risks that could negatively 
affect our competitive standing and generation of reve-
nue, since the prices of many of the commodities that are 
essential for maintaining production are tied to the dollar .
How do we manage this?  
We continually monitor all the contexts of the markets in 
which we operate through consultants, local monitoring, 
associations and other mechanisms. We administrate part 
of our exchange rate risk through foreign currency deriv-
atives instruments and future cash flows of exports in US 
dollars and other foreign currencies.
What opportunities exist?  
The opportunities involve a reinforcement of the business 
intelligence instruments and the diversification of our 
global activities in order to minimize our exposure to spe-
cific markets and risks.
Commodities and the cyclical nature of the business 
 GRI 3-3: Material Topic (Management, transparency and traceability of 
the supply chain)
Affected capitals:  
Financial capital and Natural capital
What is the risk?  
Our operational results are subject to the cycles and volatil-
ity that affect the prices of commodities, poultry and pork, 
which can have an adverse effect on our whole business.
How do we manage this?  
Both in Brazil and abroad the industry is characterized by 
cyclical periods of higher prices and greater profitability, 
as well as lower prices and less profitability. Within this 
context, we study the sector movements and volatility of 
commodities in depth by closely monitoring grain stocks 
and the climate in the productive regions. By doing so, it 
is possible to direct our purchasing decisions, as well as 
forecast the prices on the commodities market.
What opportunities exist?  
We have opportunities to make gains in both efficiency and 
competitive standing through a strategy focused on an 
appreciation of the aspects of interdependence between 
the parts and the whole – as well as careful planning of the 
production, and meeting the demands of different global 
markets.

Climate risk  
TCFD-2-a , TCFD-2.b, TCFD-2.c, SASB-FB-MP-440a.3, GRI 3-3: Material 
Topic (climate change, water and energy), 201-2
Affected capitals:  
Financial capital and Natural capital
What is the risk?  
We consider the potential effects of climate change in our 
operations and in the supply chain and we recognize the 
vulnerabilities associated with the natural resources and 
agricultural products that are essential to our activities. 
The principal risks tied into this matter relate to shifts in 
the temperature and rain patterns, including droughts 
and natural disasters, that could affect agricultural pro-
ductivity, animal welfare and the availability of water and 
energy. These factors can adversely affect our costs and 
operational results, including causing a rise in the price 
of agricultural commodities. When this happens, there is 
an impact on the costs involved in guaranteeing animal 
welfare and production. Also as a result of climate change 
we can be impacted in relation to those of our environ-
mental/EESG programs or certifications connected to the 
reduction of exposure to climate change. Other important 
factors associated with the climate include our depen-
dence on electricity in the operations (exposure, there-
fore, to the fluctuations in energy costs, blackout prob-
lems or supply crises); as well as regulatory alterations, 
such as the pricing or taxation of carbon, and changes 
in the legislation governing the emission of greenhouse 
gases in Brazil and the other markets where we operate. 
How do we manage this?  
We have assumed public commitments to enhance our 
contribution to the combating of climate change. As well 
as the commitment to becoming Net Zero by 2040, we 
have targets relating to energy consumption using clean 
sources and a reduction in our use of water and we have 
made significant advances in our means of control to 
ensure the traceability of grains originating from the Am-
azon and Cerrado regions, as we aim to establish a chain 
that is free from deforestation and with a low impact on 
biodiversity. Using geospatial technology and data sci-
ence with investment of approximately R$ 618,000 per 
year .
What opportunities exist?  
Our operations depend upon the use of energy sources. 
As such, we have started to invest in the construction of 
our own clean source energy production plants. As well as 
ensuring the provision of energy for our units and miti-
gating the emission of greenhouse gases, these invest-
ments bring economic opportunities by offering compet-
itive production values and potential cost reductions over 
the next 15 years.   
Environmental compliance and access 
to water and energy resources
Affected capital:  
Natural capital
What is the risk?  
Just as a lack of water affects any human activity, in the 
case of BRF, the impact of water shortages can be signifi-
cantly felt throughout its production chain, especially in 
relation to the irrigation of grains for the production of 
animal feed, providing water for animal consumption or 
our productive processes.
How do we manage this? Within our system of envi-
ronmental management, we have established a series 
of guidelines for gauging the water vulnerability of our 
plants, monitoring our consumption to be able to ration 
the use of water in our processes, and implementing 
corrective actions and contingency plans for when this 
risk arises. We also have plans in place to prioritize invest-
ments in the transportation of water to our productive 
units, as a means of increasing the capillarity of our me-
tering and for the reuse and recycling of this resource. 
What opportunities exist? Our opportunity drivers 
involve the evolution and ongoing improvement of our 
water management, thereby boosting the potential for 
water recycling and reuse, increasing the capillarity of our 
metering, eliminating waste and finding technologies that 
streamline the use of water in our operations. Net Zero
by 2040
is the commitment that 
BRF has made, our biggest 
contribution to combating 
climate change.

Trade barriers and market 
protections SASB FB-MP-250a.4
Affected capital:  
Financial capital
What is the risk?  
More rigorous commercial barriers in our leading export 
markets can negatively affect our operational results.
How do we manage this?  
Some countries, such as Russia and South Africa, have a 
history of imposing trade barriers on the importation of 
food products. Furthermore, many developed countries 
use direct and indirect subsidies to increase the compet-
itive standing of their own producers in other markets. 
The European Union, for example, has adopted a system 
of quotas for certain poultry products as a means of 
mitigating the effects Brazil’s lower production costs have 
on European producers, whilst it has also been consid-
ering new regulations that could reduce the access that 
certain products have to the market. Since 2017, the 
Chinese government has been performing anti-dumping 
investigations in relation to Brazilian exports of whole 
chickens and chicken cuts, including our exports. Simi-
lar moves have been implemented by the South African 
government, but these have not involved investigations 
into BRF, although they could result in new restrictive 
measures. The South African government decided to 
impose a provisional tariff of 265% for companies which 
do not request individual defense, as was our case. It is 
not certain whether the local government will impose 
further restrictions on poultry and/or food commerce. 
There have also been changes underway in Saudi Arabia, 
one of our leading importers, which reduced the validity 
period for chicken from one year to 90 days, which they 
communicated to the World Trade Organization, although 
the country closed the investigation in August 2021. To 
circumvent these challenges, we paid close attention to 
international events concerning governments and au-
thorities and sought to guarantee assertive planning of 
supply, demand and production amongst BRF’s units both 
in Brazil and overseas. 
What opportunities exist?  
We have continued focusing on the evolution of our 
processes and on guaranteeing the confidence of the 
authorities, as well as the certification of the plants and 
our active participation in trade agreements that contrib-
ute to BRF’s business and to the needs of the different 
markets. We continually monitor all the the markets in 
which we operate through consultants, local supervision, 
associations and other mechanisms. Furthermore, we are 
strengthening our processes relating to products with 
higher aggregated value. 
Data Protection and Cybersecurity 
GRI 3-3: Material topic (Ethics, integrity and compliance)
Affected capitals: Intellectual capital and Social capital
What is the risk? We are subject to the risks associated 
to non-compliance with applicable data protection laws, 
and we can be negatively affected by the imposition of 
fines and other types of penalties. Violations, interrup-
tions or defects in our information technology systems 
(including as a result of cybersecurity attacks) can inter-
rupt our operations and negatively impact our businesses 
and reputation.
How do we manage this? We are constantly working 
to ensure the security of our technological environment 
and protection of our assets. We have adopted a compre-
hensive approach that involves a wide range of technolo-
gies, policies and contingencies. We hold regular training 
sessions designed to raise our employees’ awareness of 
information security practices, with the aim of ensuring 
that they are all engaged in keeping our cybernetic sys-
tems and the integrity of our data safe.
To meet the increasing regulatory demands and guaran-
tee protection of the personal data that we handle, we

have developed a comprehensive privacy program. This 
program includes measures designed to identify and 
classify personal data, consent management, protection 
against threats to data security and constant monitoring 
to ensure compliance with regulatory demands, such as 
the General Personal Data Protection Law (LGPD), that 
has been in effect in Brazil since 2020.
Furthermore, we have implemented mechanisms to con-
tinually monitor and review our security policies and pro-
cedures. We are committed to maintaining our approach 
to information security, always updating and constantly 
evolving, with the aim of guaranteeing the best possible 
protection for our technological assets and the data that 
we handle. 
Tax 
Affected capital:  
Financial capital
What is the risk?  
Changes to the tax laws or their interpretation can in-
crease our tax burden and, as a result, negatively affect 
our operational results and financial situation. Further-
more, disputes over compensation of tax credits and the 
use of tax incentives can represent risk to the Company's 
reputation.
How do we manage this?  
The tax strategies adopted by BRF include the mitigation 
of risks to the corporate reputation, and the transactions 
between the companies within the group are subject 
to the Policy for Related Parties, meaning they are also 
subject to the Transfer Pricing laws and regulations of 
each country or region where the related companies are 
domiciled. We have also implemented a Tax Management 
Policy that establishes directives, roles and responsibil-
ities relating to tax compliance, a topic that has its own 
management team responsible for ensuring adherence 
to currently applicable legislation at federal, state and 
municipal levels; reducing risks and improving our inter-
nal processes  (find out more about this in our Policy on 
Our approach to cyber risk and data protection 
combines policies and procedures, as well as 
the directives of our privacy program.
Related-Party Transactions and the Tax Management Policy). 
Furthermore, we have a matrix of SOX and NSOX controls 
in the Tax Department, the purpose of which is to guaran-
tee the accuracy of the information. The strategic topics 
and initiatives connected to taxation are evaluated by the 
Tax Committee whilst the Vice-President of Finance and 
the directors of the department have the power of veto. If 
necessary, these issues are the object of decisions taken 
by the committees and/or corporate bodies.
What opportunities exist? The most important tax pro-
cesses are revised periodically by the Internal Audit and 
by independent auditors in such a way as to safeguard 
against the entry of aggressive or evasive tax policies that 
could generate risks for the Company and its stakehold-
ers.

BRF quality  
GRI 416-1, 416-2, FP5
 
Quality is a non-negotiable commitment for BRF. We 
believe that our reputation, image and ability to generate 
value are intrinsically linked to our adherence to the pre-
cepts of quality in the processes and food products that 
are global benchmarks.
Over recent years, we have broadened our understanding 
of the concept to go beyond the adhesion of our prod-
uct portfolio to include sanitary, nutritional and sensory 
criteria. We are also attentive to the perception of quality 
and the diligence in performance of the processes taking 
the products from the farms to the points of sale, in order 
to protect welfare and fulfill our aim of delivering healthy 
and tasty food that has been produced responsibly with-
out complications or impacts.
The BRF Quality System leads us to seek the best solu-
tions to mitigate dangers, ensure coherence between 
discourse and practice in the application of our policies, 
establish clear governance concerning the matter , and 
direct investments and programs towards guaranteeing 
Our assessments of BRF’s impact on 
the health and safety of the consumer 
cover 100% of our products and 
categories
Responsibility for the product
SASB FB-MP-250A.2, SASB FB-MP-250A.3, GRI 3-3: Material Topic 
(Quality and safety of the products) 416-1, 416-2
We formally established our commitment to quality 
through the implementation of norms that standardize 
all the processes, guaranteeing a standard of excellence 
at all our production units. Each one of these units has 
implemented an HACCP (Hazard analysis and critical 
control points) plan. These plans involve an evaluation 
of the severity versus likelihood of occurrence of the 
hazards that exist in each production process. 
By means of initiatives such as Operational Excellence 
System (‘SEO’), ‘More Excellence’ and ‘Ideal Store’, the 
care shown to our product covers the entire production 
chain. We have strengthened fulfillment of the stan-
dards defined and identified any non-compliance based 
upon the directives for ongoing improvement contained 
in BRF’s quality system. Internal and external audits 
are conducted independently by the Corporate Quality 
Assurance department and by external organizations. 
In addition to this, we adopt the Quality Index, which 
analyzes and monitors complaints, compliance with 
the products’ sensory standards, and the results of our 
performance in micro-biology performance.
Another important practice relates to the management 
of the creation, production, and slaughter of animals; 
in 2022, we took important steps forward in the digital 
control of sanitary aspects and vaccine protocols, the 
study of products that can act as alternatives to antibi-
otics and a review of our biosafety protocols (read about 
this in more detail in Animal Welfare).
quality. At BRF, 100% of our products and categories are 
included in an evaluation of the impact on the consumer’s 
health and safety.
For BRF, quality management is a tool for managing both 
real and potential impacts on the lives of consumers - and 
one of our sustainability material topics. As well as the 
BRF Quality System and our corporate policy on the issue, 
we also monitor indicators relating to non-compliance, 
treaties, deviations from quality standards, and risks and 
dangers, planning improvements and mitigating poten-
tially negative impacts. We also consider our contacts 
with consumers and clients as inputs for understanding 
potential problems or opportunities for improvement. The 
matter of quality and safety of our products was highlight-
ed in our most recent materiality process, with the per-
spective of the publics consulted playing an essential role 
for us to be able to refine our understanding and compre-
hension of all that quality covers.

Use of GMOs
According to the needs of our consumers, we supply 
ingredients and products both with and without 
Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs). We do not 
produce or plant GMOs, but we understand that 
such organisms may possibly be used in the produc-
tion chain. 
 We work on technological innovations to expand 
food supply, provided they are safe and duly certi-
fied along the chain.
Regulatory agencies such as the European Food 
Safety Authority (EFSA), and the National Technical 
Commission on Biosafety (CTNBio), in Brazil, have 
concluded studies on the production of GMOs and 
derivative ingredients that confirm their safety for 
human consumption.
All of our products containing GMOs provide infor-
mation for the consumers, in accordance with the 
national and international legislation applicable to 
each market. Find out more here. 
In 2022, there were 44 cases of fines and penalties for 
noncompliance relating to impacts on health and safety 
caused by products and services. All of these cases have 
been studied in detail to avoid occurrences of a similar 
nature happening again. 
Also in 2022, we conducted two recalls, involving the with-
drawal from circulation of products being sold by BRF PET, 
but which had been manufactured by third parties. The 
first case involved the dental ‘sticks’ produced by the Bas-
sar brand, following cases of dogs becoming intoxicated. 
Following this, BRF PET voluntarily recalled the pet treats 
being sold under the Patense group’s ‘Pets Mellon’ brand. 
Both these recalls are in progress, with conclusion expect-
ed in 2023. The weight of the recalled products totaled 2.2 
tons.
Initiatives such as the ‘Operational 
Excellence System’ (OES), the ‘More 
Excellence’ and the ‘Ideal Store’, mean 
that care for the quality of our product 
is implemented throughout BRF’s 
production chain.

Certifications and audits     
GRI 3-3: Material Topic (Quality and safety of the products), FP1, FP2
In addition to all the controls and criteria, our quality sys-
tem and the certification procedures we have implement-
ed all undergo audits relating to animal welfare, quality, 
the environment and safety. We also subject ourselves to 
external audits relating to the certification of the pro-
cesses in accordance with different international norms, 
amongst which are the ISO 9001 (Quality Management 
System) and BRC (British Retail Consortium) and IFS (Inter-
national Feature Standards) quality certifications.
Our clients also perform external audits on BRF plants 
certified for exportation in Brazil, Turkey and Abu Dhabi. 
Furthermore, we have a certification program for our 
suppliers that is based upon international certification 
requirements in accordance with the Global Markets 
program established by the Global Food Safety Initiative 
(GFSI). In 2022, 95% of the installations operated by our 
suppliers were GFSI certified. 
In the field, our production processes are continually 
checked and audited both by our clients and by interna-
tional entities. Amongst the certifications that we hold in 
this area are the ‘Global G.A.P’ for livestock production and 
‘Certified Humane’, for animal welfare seals.
Finally, regulatory agencies, such as the Ministry of Ag-
riculture, Livestock and Supply (Mapa) and the National 
Sanitary Surveillance Agency (Anvisa) in Brazil; the Ministry 
of Food, Agriculture and Livestock in Turkey; and the Abu 
Dhabi Agriculture & Food Safety Authority (Adafsa), audit 
and check our activities, attesting to the compliance of 
our practices with the applicable legal requirements. We 
have also obtained the Authorized Economic Operator 
(AEO) certification, which is issued by the Brazilian Federal 
Internal Revenue Service, qualifying us as a safe and reli-
able company in our Overseas Trade Operations.
Plant Approvals
We should further highlight our plants’ export certification 
processes for trading with international markets. From 
technical preparation to obtaining new qualifications, this 
process relates to the provision of proof of different stan-
dards and aspects of quality that vary depending upon 
the regulatory scenario of the specific countries. 
In the second half of 2022, we made significant advances, 
with our plants obtaining 16 new export certifications to 
countries such as Canada, Mexico and Japan. In Cana-
da, for example, the authorizations related to fresh and 
frozen pork meat and cooked poultry, certifying our plants 
located in Toledo (PR) and Campos Novos (SC). The Cam-
pos Novo plant, one of our newest, is certified for export 
to South Korea, China, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Rus-
sia, Ukraine and Moldova, as well as Paraguay, Uruguay 
and Argentina.
At the end of the year , our plant in Lajeado Minuano 
regained its certification to export to China, after it had 
been suspended, and, in 2023, we have plans on our 
radar to make further inroads into China as well as into 
the Americas, such as the Mexican market, and Europe, 
adopting the relevant benchmark standards in quality and 
safety. Also in 2022, the Kizad plant, in the United Arab 
Emirates, was recertified for exports to Saudi Arabia.

Partnership with clients and consumers  
GRI 3-3: Material Topic (Quality and safety of the products)
We recognize that the confidence of those who acquire, 
sell or consume BRF products is essential to the growth of 
our business and brands. We invest in actions that range 
from the nutritional profile of products to the quality of 
the deliveries and processes, including improvements to 
the relationship channels and understanding the profiles 
and needs of the dozens of markets in which we operate.
Be it to serve our clients (different sized companies, pro-
cessors, distribution companies and points of sale around 
Brazil and the rest of the world), or be it to serve our end 
consumer , BRF bases its activities on transparency, eth-
ics and its commitment to quality and safety, as well as 
the ongoing objective of providing positive experiences 
with our products and services at their different points of 
contact.
Within the channels forming the basis of our relationship 
with our consumers and clients, the operations of our 
Customer Services Center (SAC) are guided by the Con-
sumer Defense Code and focused on constantly striving 
for excellence in customer services. For the second con-
secutive year , we were awarded the Modern Consumer 
Award for Excellence in Customer Services and for the 
10th consecutive year , we were awarded the ‘Reclame Aqui 
Award’, whilst also being directly recognized by our con-
sumers, as can be noted in the internal ‘NPS’ indicator .  
Our ongoing investments in digital transformation, added 
to a personalized and individual service, allow BRF to be 
fully available to promptly and attentively meet consumer 
demands. We provide a platform where the processes 
are managed in real time (thus guaranteeing speed and 
flexibility in the responses and discussions), and different 
relationship channels - including a virtual assistant, ser-
vices via WhatsApp, portals and social media, as well as the 
traditional service channels such as telephone, ‘Contact us’ 
(on the website) and e-mail, which are all fully integrated 
to offer the client a centralized experience. In 2020, 82% of 
the cases registered with Customer Services in Brazil were 
neutral or positive, and 18% were complaints.

We have made innovations in our partnerships with 
clients and consumers by means of the implementa-
tion of the ‘customer experience’ program, based upon 
the ‘NPS’ – ‘Net Promoter Score’. We actively collect the 
opinions of our customers and clients at their different 
points of contact with the company and continually an-
alyze the feedback, with internal data and negotiations, 
as a means of providing the company with retroactive 
input from the consumer and ensuring ongoing im-
provements to the processes, whether they relate to the 
products or the services provided. 
The partnership with our customers is also maintained 
through ongoing contacts designed to understand 
our products, categories, trends and performance in 
different markets and locations. With these results to 
hand, we look to study possible innovations as well as 
improve the satisfaction with our brands. In 2022, we 
performed studies that mapped out trends, customer 
behavior , concepts and product performance. 
Data privacy GRI 418-1
BRF recognizes the importance of protecting our stakehold-
ers’ privacy. As such, we have a Privacy Policy and pursue 
actions to ensure that our practices are in compliance with 
the General Data Protection Law (LGPD). In 2022, there were 
no complaints or events involving violation of privacy or loss 
of client data.

ents added to the products, as well as the packaging that 
either has or could have direct contact with our products. 
In relation to recyclable packaging, BRF’s labels specify the 
recycling category to which each of the packaging items 
belongs and the correct forms of disposal, in accordance 
with ABNT NBR Standard 13230.
In order to attest to the quality of our products, we study 
the insertion of additional information, including recycling 
and selective waste collection seals, and certifications re-
lating to specific markets (such as Halal, related to Islamic 
standards).
 
In relation to packaging that can be recycled, BRF speci-
fies on the packaging itself the particular recycling cate-
gory which each of these packages belongs to and the 
correct forms of disposal, in accordance with ABNT NBR 
Standard 13230.
In 2022, we had six cases of non-compliance of labeling 
or packaging  involving regulations and voluntary codes 
in relation to the information and labeling of products 
and services. Through an event that was registered with 
Procon, we also identified one case in which a consumer 
complained of a misleading advertisement due to the dif-
ference of the image of a product on the packaging and 
the number of ingredients actually present in the product. 
All BRF S.A. judicial and administrative processes are con-
trolled by the company’s own legal processes manage-
ment system, and all are duly addressed and resolved. 
The packaging, inputs and 
raw-materials used in 100% 
of our products are subject 
to an internal ratification 
model, involving outsourced 
manufacturing process audits.
Marketing, labeling and communication  
GRI 3-3: Material Topic (food safety), 417-1, 417-2, 417-3
Our registration and labeling department checks all the 
necessary legal requirements (name, list of ingredients, 
claims, lettering size and nutritional table, safe use of 
the product, safety in preparation, handling suggestions, 
storage and refrigeration, and substances which could 
have an environmental or social effect, amongst others) in 
100% of the product categories and in all label alteration 
projects. We pay great attention to our communication, 
which involves elements of integrity, transparency and 
clarity in the presentation of the products’ attributes.
The packaging, inputs and raw-materials used comply 
with an internal ratification model, involving the technical 
departments (R&D and Quality) with audits performed 
during the different outsourced manufacturing process-
es in order to check for compliance with all applicable 
regulations and our sensory requirements. There are also 
checks performed on all the raw materials and ingredi-

Nutrition and healthiness GRI 3-3: Material Topic (Food 
safety) FP5, FP6, FP7
Aware of the global food challenges, we have been 
working together with the Brazilian Foodstuffs Industries 
Association (ABIA) for ten years in support of healthiness, 
and over the last year we have worked on development of 
a nutritional strategy guided by an holistic and integrative 
approach founded on the pillars of the Access to Nutrition 
Initiative (ATNI), which guide our nutrition guidelines:
We work in line with the constantly evolving strategic, 
market and commercial objectives of the business on a 
constant journey of evolution. 
We aim to constantly improve our products, investing in 
lines of research and technological innovation designed 
to improve the nutritional quality of the products, with the 
primary aim of reducing the levels of sodium and saturat-
ed fats. We aim to offer a diverse and balanced portfolio, 
to meet the different nutritional needs of the consumers 
and demands of the market.
In 2022, we launched around 70 new products, such as, 
for example, the vegetables forming the Veg & Tal Sadia, 
line, chicken joints as part of Assa Fácil in the Sadia Bio 
line, and Ready Meals with rice, chicken and creamed 
corn.
We operate in categories that provide opportunities for 
improvements in production, monitoring the trends in 
current legislation, such as RDC n° 429, dated 2020, and 
IN n° 75, also dated 2020, which address the new nutri-
tional labeling of foods in Brazil,
We contribute with access to high-protein food sources 
through a solid distribution network, supplying products 
throughout the country. We support initiatives aimed at 
reducing food waste through actions together with the 
BRF Institute and we are constantly working to reduce 
food loss, through efficiency in the chain and sustainable 
practices. 
We defend balanced consumption and healthy habits, 
suggesting consumers adopt balanced combinations for 
different meals (https://www.sadia.com.br/menu-da-sem-
ana), whilst we also care for the health and quality of life 
of our employees.
We have a responsible marketing policy, complying with 
all local regulations.
We ensure clear and transparent nutritional information, 
in compliance with all current local labeling legislation.
We take a sector-based, ethical, transparent and responsi-
ble approach to operations with interested parties related 
this issue.

Driving innovation
BRF has taken significant steps forward in its digital inno-
vation and transformation agenda. Both these fronts sup-
port sustained growth and business efficiency, helping us 
to offer increasingly efficient and economic quality foods 
to our customers - from the field to the table.
Our digital innovation and transformation projects have 
been accelerated throughout the chain, involving the 
integrated producers, farms, productive units, businesses, 
distribution centers and corporate processes, until our 
products reach the end consumer . The initiatives include 
issues such as animal welfare, control over the origins 
of the grains and quality of the foods, as well as devel-
opment of new lines of products and businesses - from 
the perspective of the growth plans set out in our future 
vision.
At the Innovation Center , we are constantly performing 
studies to improve our products. The BRF Hub, mean-
while, acts as BRF’s connection channel with the open 
innovation ecosystem in Brazil and overseas, developing 
initiatives such as the Challenges Program, which once 
a year brings together innovative solutions developed 
by startups and academic researchers to help resolve 
the company's strategic challenges. After only being in 
existence for three years, the BRF Hub has already es-
tablished 570 connections with startups. One of these 
connections is with the Israeli startup Aleph Farms, with 
which BRF has established a partnership and become the 
first Brazilian company to enter the cultured meats mar-
ket, a strategic field for the future.
Knowledge creation
Whenever BRF brings technology and knowledge 
into its activities, the benefits are evident not only 
to the Company but also to society as a whole. In 
particular , the cooperation and synergy between 
BRF and the academic world have been extreme-
ly fruitful. These projects have taken the form of 
Masters and Doctorate research work to create 
and test new technologies.   
So far , BRF has made more than 20 presentations 
at congresses and established cooperations with 
Brazilian universities in states such as Santa Cata-
rina, Rio Grande do Sul, Paraná and São Paulo, as 
well as a number of foreign institutions. The Com-
pany has registered one patent arising from these 
partnerships and another one is one the way. 
BRF also believes in the power of ‘bottom-up’ innova-
tion, or in other words, ideas and suggestions made by 
our own employees. The ‘BRF Garage’ is the project re-
sponsible for encouraging entrepreneurship within the 
Company involving the participation of multi-functional 
leaders. Amongst the initiatives developed as part of 
the BRF Garage, the one which stands out the most is 
the ‘Innovation Scouts’ program, by means of which we 
drive our culture of innovation and propose new busi-
ness models amongst our internal stakeholders. 
Created just four years ago, this initiative has already 
served as a platform for around 2,000 ideas, which can 
be put forward as proposals following analysis  which 
considers both adherence to the Company's objectives 
and implementation viability. Those responsible for 
the three best ideas each year receive a cash award, as 
well as the opportunity to present their business plan 
and possible prototypes to the BRF Board. They then 
participate in a business design workshop offered in 
partnership with a teaching institution, which assists 
them in developing their business plan.
After just three years of existence,, the BRF Hub 
has already established 570 connections with 
startups. Over the course of four years of the 
‘Innovations Scouts’ program, for example, we 
have collected around 2,000 innovative ideas 
from our employees.

Portfolio and brand
We are aware of the need to quickly and reliably introduce 
innovations that meet the needs of our consumers in 
Brazil and elsewhere in the world. Our innovation agenda 
is guided by research into trends, monitoring changing 
habits, and studies at our Innovation Center . 
In 2022, we restructured our innovation processes, with 
the aim of strengthening the ties between the areas 
responsible for brands and categories and the teams 
working on research and development, structuring them 
around the concept of ‘Growth Office’. As part of this work, 
we have taken a closer look at our portfolio, aiming to 
combine our customers’ preferences with concrete and 
measurable market share results and the margin/share of 
the innovation products in the Company's results.
The central aims of this work were to increase the con-
tribution of innovations to BRF’s results and more effec-
tively allocate funds to projects that firmly establish our 
business vision. In 2022, we raised R$ 30 million through 
this streamlining; at the same time, we directed our 
innovation efforts to the core business, in categories and 
platforms where we have already consolidated our po-
sition and on innovative fronts where we have a greater 
perspective for growth.
We launched 106 innovations in 2022. We have increased 
our investments in the processed foods category, which 
represents a significant portion of our business, and start-
ed to once again offer products such as the Sadia brand 
bulk sausages, consolidating our position with this brand 
in both Brazil and the rest of the world. 
We have invested in a study for the development of prod-
ucts in the 'hot bowls’ line, following a consumer trend 
observed in different markets, focused on convenience 
and practicality, without the need to transfer the food 
onto a plate after defrosting and preparation. In 2022, 
following the launch of ‘Mac ‘n’ Cheese’ in 2020, which has 
seen good results ever since, we made preparations to 
launch the hot bowls line in Carbonara, Baby Meatballs, 
Broccoli and Bacon flavors - which entered the market at 
the beginning of 2023.
Also in 2020, we introduced the Sadia Bio brand’s ‘Assa 
Fácil’ line of chicken joints, combining aspects of sustain-
ability/traceability and certifications with convenient pack-
aging that can go straight into the oven, without needing 
to be defrosted. The Bio line is focused on a sustainability 
production line, with 15 producer families responsible 
for the rearing of animals fed on 100% vegetable feed, 
without use of antibiotics or performance enhancers, 
whilst adhering to best practices of animal welfare, with 
international certification from Certified Humane® and 
WQS®. Another differential is the ability to track the entire 
production chain by means of a QR Code on the label of 
each product and the line’s website. 
We have also relaunched traditional products, using 
intelligent management that aims to draw results from 
our different brands. At Perdigão, we are working hard 
with special fresh cuts, ‘Our Menu’ ready meals, with 
portions designed for two people, and fresh sausages, de-
signed for special situations such as barbecues. We also 
launched the ‘Chester Pie’ in chicken with sausage and 
cheddar , and chicken with leek and olive flavors. 
Our attention to the international markets was another 
highlight. In the Halal markets we launched pre-marinat-
ed chicken breast in cubes, with spices adapted to the 
local culture and habits. We have also invested in mar-
keting cuts such as individually frozen and spiced chicken 
breasts, and processed foods, such as nuggets - in line 
with our strategy to double our share in aggregated value 
products in the Halal markets within three years.

Excellence and digital 
transformation
BRF believes in the transformative power of technology, 
digital thinking and the striving for operational excellence. 
To improve our results and historic levels, as well as to 
firmly establish our growth plans, we are pursuing proj-
ects which allow us to reframe the business and make our 
processes more streamlined, practical and effective.
We are constructing the business of tomorrow today, by 
means of a series of digital initiatives and management 
guided by data. By doing so, the Company can plan and 
outline more robust and assertive strategies, always with 
a focus on the result and the generation of value for the 
clients, customers, shareholders and the entire produc-
tion chain. The actions, that range from the field to the 
table, include the digitization of the agricultural operation 
and incremental improvements at the industrial plants in 
the different markets.
Our innovative solutions include the use of advanced 
statistics and technologies such as cognitive intelligence 
(chatbots), the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning 
and advanced analytics. One example of an initiative of 
this type is the use of predictive models and machine 
learning algorithms to predict the average price of chick-
en slaughter . Through this innovation, BRF can plan and 
achieve the best cost-benefits between the time spent 
rearing the animals and the right moment for their 
slaughter (taking into consideration the different variables 
that can influence this process, such as the availability and 
quality of feed, climate, and housing and sanitary condi-
tions), thus achieving an important competitive advan-
tage.
BRF was recognized in the ‘100+ Innovators in the Use 
of Technology’ category awarded by IT Mídia in 2022 for 
its 'Data Driven from Field to Table’ project. The initiative 
forms part of the Company's digital transformation jour-
ney and can be added to the 52 initiatives implemented 
during the year to provide greater agility and assertive-
ness in decision-making, with benefits for the chain as a 
whole. 
As well as promoting a culture guided by data, the Com-
pany has invested in ongoing learning and a culture of 
innovation, making a new BRF Academy available - this 
being a learning platform that can be accessed by all our 
employees. In 2022, we reached more than 7,600 employ-
ees by means of the online ‘LearningFlix’ channel provided 
through the BRF Academy and dedicated to the dissem-
ination of a streamlined culture, innovation and digital 
transformation.
‘Go digital’ and ‘Be digital’: our agenda
Digital Transformation at BRF is taking place on two major 
fronts: Go Digital, where we are working on improving 
our results through the modernization and digitalization 
of the processes related to our business and to our stake-
holders, and Be Digital, in which we are taking a close 
look at our internal processes, with tools and platforms 
that provide greater efficiency and facilitate the employ-
ment journey of the Company’s almost 100 thousand 
employees. 
Amongst the internal processes that have already been 
considered for digitization actions are employee attraction 
and selection, digital admission, the self-service portal, the 
learning platform, management of results, and develop-
ment, performance, succession and remuneration cycles, 
Currently, all admissions at BRF in Brazil are performed 
online, which simplifies and streamlines the process, as 
well as improving the transparency of the new employee’s 
onboarding process. More than 30,000 employees have 
joined the company through this new process. 
Another advance in the Employee’s Journey has been 
‘Flor’, the virtual assistant in the Human Resources depart-
ment. Available to our employees is Brazil and the Middle

East, she attends to more than 115,000 inquiries each 
month, drawing upon artificial intelligence and machine 
learning resources to clarify up to 1,075 questions, queries 
and requests by means of an intuitive and easily accessed 
service that is available 24/7. 
We have also developed specific actions for our teams to 
be able to think and act more digitally in the field, such as 
the Middle East Sales Revamp, which has put new technol-
ogies directly into the hands of our sales representatives, 
providing greater operational efficiency and reliability in the 
transactions for the teams in the field to be able to replace 
manual terminals and sales receipts, as well as centralize 
the information in their smartphone, showing the status of 
the orders in real time.
Another solution focused on the sales team in Brazil is 
‘Tina’. With the personalized guidance and support provid-
ed by the app and the chatbot, the sales team can concen-
trate themselves on strategic activities, while Tina takes 
care of the more mundane day-to-day tasks and offers 
important information in real time. Furthermore, the reduc-
tion of the learning curve for new sales staff is a significant 
benefit, since it helps to quickly integrate them into the 
team and speed up their performance. Tina issues alerts 
prioritizing business opportunities and preventing possible 
shortages.
The transformative approach to our processes has been 
highlighted in our innovation strategy over recent years, 
being added to the digital approach in relation to our 
clients and customers. In our digital transformation pro-
grams in 2022, we have structured and consolidated four 
central fronts: Agro 4.0, Logistics 4.0, Commodities 4.0 and 
Industry 4.0.
Below is a balance sheet of investments and highlights.

Agro 4.0
The Agro 4.0 digital platform aims to increasingly 
establish the connection with the integrated producers, 
creating an ecosystem that meets their needs, facilitates 
life in the field, creates lines of family succession based 
upon technology, brings longevity to the process and 
increases both the efficiency and sustainability.
More than 9,500 integrated producers, as well as 600 
extension workers (veterinarians) make use of the Agro 
4.0 platform, a digital product developed in-house which, 
in 2022, was scaled up to global level to allow access by 
integrated producers and extension workers in Turkey.
Read more about some of the leading actions:
New features in the Next app
Through this technological platform, extension workers 
can manage their routines more efficiently using tools such 
as a logbook and an integrated checklist of their visits to 
different locations, as well as access all the information and 
notifications on the lots from their integrated producers. 
The app also allows for registration of technical advice and 
the monitoring of results.
AgroBRF – Producers’ Platform
This platform consists of an ecosystem that is connected 
to all of the company’s satellite systems, providing the 
producer with an extensive amount of information on their 
lots, this being very important in the daily routine. This new 
model of working based upon data collected online (which 
are updated daily and processed using artificial intelligence 
and machine learning tools) will help the Company to evolve 
in terms of production and efficiency in the Agricultural 
chain. The platform also involves communication features, 
fleet tracking and a dashboard of indicators on the poultry, 
turkey and pig chains.
Grain monitoring
Advances in the installation of sensors 
on farms with data collected using IoT, 
allowing the installations to be monitored 
in real time, and providing better support 
for decision-making.
Research performed together with 
other areas 
connected to production, such as those focused 
on the genetic improvement of herds (biological 
assets) and feed conversion (or in other words, 
the relationship between feed consumed and 
weight gain).
•  Implementation of innovative respiratory 
monitoring technology by a partner producer 
in Lajeado (RS), currently in the performance 
evaluation stage.
•  Implementation of weighing by image and 
growth curve by a termination/finishing partner 
in Concórdia (SC), also in the evaluation stage.
•  Expansion of the biological starter culture 
production project, together with 30 partners, 
which allows for the biodegradability of organic 
material present in waste.

Commodities 4.0
The Commodities 4.0 Journey combines territorial intel-
ligence technology solutions and advanced analytics to 
digitalize the Company’s entire grains acquisition process, 
ensuring greater transparency, assertiveness and agility 
in the procurement processes by connecting the pro-
ducers with BRF. As one of the branches of the journey, 
it integrates our efforts to move forward on our public 
commitment to guaranteeing the traceability of 100% of 
the grains we buy from the Amazon and Cerrado regions 
by 2025. This commitment is directly linked to one of the 
fronts of the 2040 Net Zero Plan.
The project also optimizes BRF’s logistics positioning, 
planning a better combination between the current and 
future logistics positions to ensure a streamlined supply 
to the production units. This activity is performed using 
satellite monitoring of 7 million hectares of farmland in 
7 Brazilian states and, with the help of a mathematical 
algorithm and a data repository (including market data), it 
allows BRF to identify the best moment to purchase corn 
- thereby creating insights into the future price of grain 
with a 24 month perspective, and allowing us to plan and/
or use grain stocks depending upon market fluctuations. 
Another benefit of the platform is that it provides a full 
and comprehensive vision of the transportation chain, 
from the negotiation of the freight through to the delivery 
of the grains to the factories. The automation of the pur-
chase confirmation emission process, legal contracts and 
contracting of freight is performed through the Robotics 
Process Automation system.
Innovations with EESG benefits are on the radar for our 
supply processes. In 2022, we developed an innovative 
solution for the drying of grains at 14 branches in Bra-
zil. Under the new process, we have replaced the use of 
wood logs with wood chips in the dryers, meaning greater 
efficiency and safety, as well as cost reduction, thanks to 
the automation - without having to transport the wood 
logs manually. The process means a potential reduction of 
up to 15% in the grain drying time and 60% in labor costs, 
whilst also resulting in a more uniform generation of heat, 
thus benefiting the quality of the grain, ensuring a more 
economical use of the raw-material (chips, obtained from 
our own reforestation projects and supplied by third par-
ties) and a reduction in the consumption of electricity.  
BRF is committed to 
guaranteeing the traceability 
of 100% of the grains bought 
from the Amazon and Cerrado 
regions by 2025

Logistics 4.0
Another important front in relation to digital transforma-
tion is that of Logistics 4.0, with the focus being the mon-
itoring of the fleets; the joint development of solutions 
relating to efficiency, emissions control, and health and 
safety; as well as the quality control of the transportation 
of live cargo, finished products and inputs.
In 2022, we expanded the fatigue control program, involv-
ing digital monitoring of drivers’ conditions, an essential 
measure for the prevention of accidents and improve-
ment of safety rates. We have invested in optimizing the 
routes through the use of more digital control over the 
movements of transport vehicles forming part of the BRF 
logistics chain.
Every one of BRF's production units in Brazil now form 
part of the 4.0 platform dedicated to monitoring more 
than 9,000 vehicles. Also in 2022, chatbots were intro-
duced into the logistics system, providing a new channel 
of communication with the drivers working for the trans-
portation companies, improving request and response 
times and improving the operating times as a whole. This 
shows how technology is facilitating our day-to-day rou-
tines and increasing efficiency and productivity.
Industry 4.0
This journey includes an incremental modification of our 
way of operating, with automation and real time obser-
vation of our industrial units through the installation of 
sensors and advanced analyses. 
In 2022, we implemented a digital solution at our 26 man-
ufacturing units in Brazil, raising the level of data manage-
ment and tracking, and optimizing the working routine.
The platform involves the digitization of 15 processes that 
make up BRF’s Auto-control Programs (PAC), with more 
than 5,000 people being impacted through the use of the 
app and the recorded data concerning the monitoring 
of the processes, thereby better streamlining the control 
and solidity of the process.  
Excellence programs
The establishment of the business plan is increasingly 
linked to an intelligent use of our industrial units, reduc-
ing inactivity, waste, absenteeism and accidents, and 
optimizing process times.
Since 2022, the program has been simplified, with the 
aim of improving performance and efficiency through the 
use of manufacturing process indicators. Furthermore, a 
synergy has been established between the SEO and the 
‘More Logistics Excellence’ programs, aiming to integrate 
the processes and optimize costs along the chain.
As a means of making improvements in this area, we 
have an Operational Excellence (OpEx) System, involving 
a set of actions relating to technological modernization, 
digitalization and gains in productivity which, over the last 
two years, has produced important results. Some of the 
highlights include:

3 Our strategy
BRF’s history of almost nine decades 
has taught the Company many things 
that, over time, it has incorporated into 
its business vision. In 2022, we directed 
our attention to the core of our 
activities, aiming to maximize the value 
created inside and outside our walls 
- stimulating development amongst 
communities and partners at the same 
time as we deliver results consistent 
with the organization’s potential.
The arrival of a new shareholder , 
Marfrig S.A., boosted a broad revision 
of the bases of the Company’s 
priorities, which involved both growth 
of the business and acceleration of 
the programs set out in its strategic 
planning.
Our aim is to be a company offering products with ag-
gregate value that fully meet the needs of consumers in 
the regions where we operate, having been developed 
innovatively and sustainably. To achieve this, as well as to 
achieve solid and stable growth, our current focus is to 
optimize the allocation of capital; direct innovation into 
those categories that contribute most to the margins; bal-
ance the relationship between our production chain and 
demands of the market and the consumers; and invest in 
digital transformation, our culture and the strength of our 
brands.
These elements form part of our business plan, with 
indicators concerning how, when and with whom we will 
be growing, in line with the Sustainability Plan (read more 
about this later on in this section). In 2020, we announced 
our growth strategy, entitled “Vision 2030”, outlining how 
we intend to be expanding the business and our global 
presence. In 2022 we reviewed this planning in light of 
the current business environment and the perspectives 
for the animal protein sector around the world, in order 
to adjust and simplify our processes - taking into consid-
eration the premises of agility, profitability and efficiency. 
We are undertaking a broad review of our long-term strat-
egy and we will be announcing the new bases of the BRF 
Vision at the proper time.
Business environment 
and planning
 
BRF’s strategy operates with a development process that 
is guided by the expertise of its shareholders and ad-
ministrators, as well as a reading of the social scenarios, 
micro/macro-economic and cultural policies that affect 
the global food industry and the sectors and categories in 
which it operates.
Our Board of Directors, with the support of the advisory 
committees, is responsible for the definition and revision 
of the strategic planning, as well as supervision of the 
Company’s progress. It is the responsibility of the execu-
tive management, composed of the CEO, Vice-Presidents’ 
offices and Boards, to ensure that it is properly executed 
through investments, programs and measures that en-
compass the global operations.

Market context
The global food industry has experienced a complex and 
unstable year in the majority of the markets where BRF is 
present. Different factors (amongst which, and most espe-
cially, are the tackling of Covid-19, the war in Ukraine and 
other areas of political instability) have caused inflationary 
pressures to spread into almost every country, generally 
affecting many different types of production chain. 
Amongst the increases that most affected BRF’s opera-
tions in 2022 were those connected to maritime freight, 
diesel and products linked to animal feed and industrial 
operations. 
The impact of these higher costs was felt in the results. 
In order to minimize its exposure to the risks and contain 
the impact of the rise in prices, BRF developed actions fo-
cused on generating more efficiency. These ranged from 
standardization of maintenance parts to the reduction of 
waste and re-engineering of packaging.
In Brazil, specifically, the domestic market continued to be 
affected by the sustained increase in inflation, which re-
duced the willingness to spend in the segments of some 
of our customers, above all in products of aggregate 
value.  Inflation closed the year with the IPCA at 5.79%, 
above the target of 3.5% established by the Central Bank. 
Defaulting rose to very high levels, at around 30%, tight-
ening the consumers’ purse strings and leading to chang-
es in spending patterns and eating habits.
In terms of production, the chain remained promising and 
important for the global animal protein market, despite 
the risks of embargoes as a result of epidemics and dis-
eases affecting pigs and poultry. In 2022, pig farming ex-
perienced its third consecutive record year in Brazil, with 
4.9 tons being produced. In relation to chicken in 2022, 
exports reached 4.8 million tons. This data is provided by 
the Brazilian Animal Protein Association (ABPA), which has 
published positive forecasts for global demand and the 
country’s export capacity for 2023.
In relation to the region of the Middle East, Turkey and 
North Africa, where we achieve a great deal of our results 
in the international market, issues such as rising infla-
tion in Turkey have arisen as specific challenges. Along 
the same lines, the complicated energy scenario and the 
chain that has been destabilized by the war in Ukraine 
have affected both the exportations and our local pro-
duction platforms. On the other hand, there is growing 
demand and interest from local governments in expand-
ing industrial and agricultural production - which, in 2022, 
encouraged us to take measures such as the inauguration 
of new plans and entering into new joint ventures.
In Asia, we should note a scenario that combines a de-
mand for food and a slowdown in growth, with particular 
economic challenges for China after the decline of the 
Covid Zero policies that the country has been subject to 
in recent years and which affected the production chains 
and economic and commercial results. On the other hand, 
the demand for animal protein has remained high, with 
positive perspectives for companies capable of address-
ing the trade protection measures adopted by this mar-
ket, a situation which has also been noted in the Middle 
East.
In order to minimize its risk exposure and 
contain the impact of the rising prices, BRF 
promoted actions designed to make its 
chain more efficient

Allocation of capital GRI 2-6
Grounded in our business vision and a cycle of strong 
investments over recent years designed to increase our 
production capacity, modernize our footprint, and expand 
our presence in strategic regions, the Company has ex-
perienced a year in which a number of important projects 
have been consolidated.
Our total Capex reached R$ 3.7 billion in 2022, a modest 
increase of 1% over the previous year . During the year we 
concluded a series of projects that were begun in 2020, 
involving new industrial plants, partnerships and asset 
modernization actions based upon the Industry 4.0 con-
cept, whilst we also prioritized the pillars of allocation of 
funds for growth, efficiency and support, biological assets, 
and commercial leasing. 
Projects of special note over the course of the year in-
cluded actions designed to increase the capacity of some 
of our plants in Brazil and Turkey, projects focused on re-
ceiving plant approvals for new markets, the construction 
of ‘Mercato Sadia’ chain units, automation of production 
lines, digital transformation projects focused on planning, 
supply and sales, repositioning of industrial park assets, 
and improvements in health and safety.
Below are listed some of our investment indicators and 
leading projects and strategic transactions in Brazil and 
elsewhere in the world in 2022.

Pet food operation
In the first quarter of 2023, we announced the beginning 
of negotiations for the future sale of our pet business 
division, made up of BRF Pet S.A., Mogiana Alimentos S.A., 
Hercosul Alimentos Ltda., Hercosul Soluções em Trans-
portes Ltda., Hercosul Distribuição Ltda. and Hercosul 
International S.R.L. 
The transaction will be performed by means of a bidding 
process, with the aim of obtaining an offer that is of most 
advantage to the Company, involving the highest price for 
the assets being sold. This process is in its initial stages, 
with preliminary discussions under way with potentially 
interested parties.
Joint venture in Saudi Arabia
In 2022, our subsidiary BRF GmbH signed a joint venture 
agreement with the Halal Products Development Compa-
ny (HPDC), a branch of the Public Investment Fund (PIF), a 
sovereign fund of Saudi Arabia.
Once the operation has been approved by the regulatory 
authorities, the new company will be constituted with BRF 
holding a 70% share and HPDC a share of up to 30%, with 
a combined investment of US$ 500 million. 
With this operation, we will be operating even more 
intensely in the chicken production chain in Saudi Arabia, 
as well as open up opportunities for us to work with fresh 
products, and frozen and processed foods. 
A deeper footprint in the Middle East
Also in Saudi Arabia, in 2022, we announced the inaugu-
ration of our new plant in Dammam, with a production 
capacity of 1,200 tons of food per month. This brought to 
a close an investment cycle that began in 2021, with US$ 
18 million allocated to preparing the unit; this being in 
addition to the acquisition of a local food processing plant 
(Joody Al Sharqiya), also in 2021, and our platform for the 
Middle East and North Africa, which includes the Banvit 
plants, in Turkey, and the plant in Abu Dhabi, in the United 
Arab Emirates. 
With these industrial assets, we are preparing our busi-
ness to increase our capacity to meet local demand, going 
beyond the simple exportation of fresh produce, with an 
eye on the opportunities available to increase our market 
share and our presence in categories and subcategories 
of aggregate value.

BRF’s Sustainability 
Plan    
GRI 2-12, 2-13, 2-19, 2-22, 2-23, 2-24, 3-3: Material Topics 2023
We are working on a daily basis to extend our incorpora-
tion of environmental, social and governance premises 
into our business decisions and strategies (EESG). 
The Sustainability Plan published in 2020 is based upon 
five main ambitions that we aim to achieve by 2040 and 
which is divided into 22 commitments. With the updating 
of our materiality (read more in ‘Report and materiality’), 
we have prioritized the objectives defined over the course 
of 2023, in light of what our stakeholders consider to be 
the most critical themes. 
BRF’s EESG management has been growing in maturity. In 
2022, as well as the Executive Committee on Sustainabili-
ty, we redrafted the scope of the Board of Directors’ advi-
sory committee, now being 100% focused on the subject 
and with the participation of three board members. 
Also in relation to our governance practices, we have 
sought to maintain a clear connection between the EESG 
targets and the variable remuneration programs, espe-
cially for the senior executives who are guiding this strate-
gy in the long-term. In 2022, the remuneration of all those 
eligible for a bonus and the company executives, in line 
with the Collective Bargaining Agreement in effect, was 
tied to the EESG targets. These targets were: the reduc-
tion of water consumption, reduction of GHG emissions 
and an increase in the percentage of women in senior 
management.
Read below the highlights of the plan’s commitments in 
2022.

Animal welfare
To ensure the non-use of growth-inducing 
antibiotics in the livestock chain   Recurring 100% BRF has not used antibiotics to stimulate growth in animals since 2019.
Zero tolerance for animal mistreatment, either 
through abuse or negligence  Recurring 100%
Since 2020, BRF has been committed to not accepting any type of 
mistreatment of animals. The livestock, transportation and industrial 
operations are constantly being checked.
To ensure that 100% of the pigs raised by BRF do 
not undergo the clipping or trimming of teeth3   2021 100% This procedure is only performed in exceptional circumstances, when the 
breeding animals’ welfare is compromised.
To ensure that 100% of the swine farmed by BRF 
are not identified using procedures involving 
mutilation

In 2022, a total sum of R$ 15.8 million was invested, with this being directed 
to the BRF Institute for the management of social actions and projects in the 
communities where BRF has operations. Of special note is the investment 
of R$ 5 million to contribute to the strengthening of basic education and 
vocational training in our priority municipalities.
Food waste
To promote education on reducing food waste 
amongst 1.5 million people globally 2030 2.26
The BRF Institute has continued with its actions and initiatives focused on 
promoting education for the reduction of food waste. In 2022, two academic 
articles on this issue were published in partnership with the José Egydio 
Setúbal Foundation, as well as videos, posts, internal campaigns and a 
specific app relating to the topic, impacting 226,952 people. Furthermore, 
the BRF Institute was able to influence Public Policies in Lucas do Rio Verde, 
through its partnership with ‘Connecting Food’, for development of an Urban 
Food Collection System in the municipality, supporting a local food donation 
and distribution network. 
Diversity
To ensure that 30% of leadership positions are held

As well as the affirmative actions involving quotas in the educational 
development and incentives programs, we made advances in the global ‘Lead 
Like a Woman’ program, which aims to develop women for whom leadership 
positions are planned and consists of assessments, mentoring, training and 
meetings with external consultancies over a four-month period. In 2022, this

The ‘Your Color is our Diversity’ campaign aims to promote literacy and racial 
identity, as well as providing a racial census in Brazil. Participation of two 
employees from the ‘Pro-leader’ Black leadership development program (in 
partnership with MOVER). 
Since 2021, together with almost 50 companies from different sectors, BRF 
participated in ‘MOVER’ (Movement for Racial Equality), which aims to tackle 
structural racism and promote racial equality.
Packaging
To have 100% recyclable, reusable, or 
biodegradable packaging 2025 12% 
implementation
In 2022, there were advances in the specifications of recyclable packaging: 
in Brazil, 10 specifications of end products which started using recyclable 
packaging were implemented, meaning that more than 90% of the global 
volume used by the company is recyclable, reusable or biodegradable. As well 
as these implementations, another 26 specifications were developed with 
plans for them to be implemented over the coming years. 
Greenhouse gases (GHG)

Just as in 2021, we complied with our target with the launch of the first plant-
based, carbon neutral chicken in Brazil, the ‘Veg Frango 100% Vegetal’, which 
forms part of the ‘Sadia Veg&Tal’ line: sliced, cubed and shredded.
Net Zero6 2040 26%
We achieved a 26% reduction in total, absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions 
compared to the baseline (2019), principally due to the decrease in the GRID 
emission factor in Brazil, leading to a reduction in BRF’s Scope 2 emissions in 
2022, and to the prioritization of renewable sources with proven traceability 
In relation to our Scope 3 emissions, meanwhile, we recorded a 5% increase 
in the sources mapped up until now against 2020 (the baseline due to the 
resumption of business trips and the significant rise in the amount of waste 
sent for external treatment in the form of composting.

 In Brazil, the percentage of reuse water jumped 11% to 15%, and we have 
achieved a 75% adherence to the water management directives implemented 
in 2022. At our plant in Dois Vizinhos, meanwhile, we have reduced water 
consumption in the chicken carcass washing booths by 50%, due to the 
installation of new technology.
To increase electricity from clean sources by 50%  2030 24%
In 2022, 24% of BRF’s electricity was drawn from clean sources - wind and 
solar .  The works projects involved in the partnerships for the generation of 
clean solar and wind energy, begun in 2021, are now under way, with the 
expectation that they will be ready to start up in 2024. With these facilities 
in place, we should be able to draw 90% of our electricity from these clean 
sources in Brazil.

Culture and 
         engagement
We work to construct and promote a strong and inte-
grated culture in our operations, which span dozens 
of nationalities and are notable for their wide range of 
customs, habits, talents and skills. The same perspective 
applies to our relations with society, by means of which 
we aim to develop agendas that reflect our objective and 
encourage local development.
We periodically conduct a Global Engagement Survey, 
with the aim of understanding the opportunities for evo-
lution and strengths identified. In the 2022 survey, 52,000 
individuals took part, meaning a general engagement rate 
of 68%. 
Our senior management analyzes the results of the study 
and establishes specific action plans that need to be 
implemented to respond to all that needs doing in our 
journey of evolution. As a global company, with almost 
100 thousand direct employees and a strong presence 
in regions including Brazil, Turkey and other countries in 
the Middle East, as well as 2,100 interns, apprentices and 
trainees, we recognize the power of our human capital to 
achieve our potential. We attract and retain talents with 
the aim of firmly establishing BRF as an employer brand - 
a place where one can construct a career and grow. GRI 2- 7
By means of these pillars, we implement programs, 
investments and actions that cover the employee’s entire 
journey, from attraction and selection of talents to the 
tools necessary for career development. In 2022, the 
highlight was the ‘Inova HR’ project, which established 
our way of analyzing all the human resources indicators 
at each operational unit. The data, which include infor-

management at the moment is turnover , given the vibrant 
labor market, especially the domestic one. Recognizing 
our ability to attract talents and provide labor training and 
qualifications, the Company has been strengthening its 
positioning in the sector . Over the last few years, we have 
also been working on highlighting the internal opportu-
nities available to employees at BRF: we promoted 6,000 
employees internally in 2022. 
The Company is also aware of the potential and real 
impacts that the business has on our employees’ working 
conditions, in areas involving health and safety, attraction 
and retention of labor and aspects related to diversity and

in the food sector
people’s welfare and the protection of their rights. We 
also publish a Transparency Manual, which presents the 
directives on conduct and behavior and contributes to 
a healthy working environment that is conducive to the 
development of human capital.
In our international operations, our priority is to integrate 
each employee into BRF’s way of existing, its values and 
its cultures, respecting the plurality that is a feature of 
our global profile. The nationalization of the operations 
in the Middle East due to the requirements, in those 
countries, of a minimum percentage of native profession-
als, has meant that we are making great efforts in local 
recruitment, combined with the ex-pat teams, who work 
as ambassadors of the Company's culture in the different

Development of 
human capital
We are committed to being more attractive to workers, 
combining processes to recruit talents, develop skills, and 
competitively recognize and remunerate the team. Our 
Personnel, Governance, Organization and Culture Com-
mittee is the benchmark organ for taking such discus-
sions to the level of the Board of Directors. 
Amongst the actions for the attraction of talents in specif-
ic profiles is the Trainee Supply program, which is focused 
on recruiting candidates for the Industry, Maintenance, 
Agro, Quality and Laboratory areas. In 2022, we recruited 
33 professionals to join the team in different areas of the 
company.
In relation to remuneration, our policies include a fixed 
sum - aligned with individual performance and market ref-
erences - and a variable sum, defined using performance 
indicators, agreed upon with the senior management. The 
High Performance Cycle is responsible for allowing us to 
evaluate performance with results broken down into indi-
cators of recognition, merit, bonus, internal recruitment 
and succession. 
The High Performance Cycle covers all the administrative 
levels and senior management and, in 2022, impacted 
13,217 professionals and leaders, compared to 12,617 
in the previous year . Another strategy is the Operational 
Performance Cycle (‘CPO’) involving professionals from 
the Operations and Sales employee group, involving the 
assessment of 62,711 employees, against 23,475 in 2021, 
representing 86% of the eligible total. The position of 
Production Operator I is still not eligible for performance 
evaluation, but will be included in the cycle in 2023.
The Company’s remuneration policy for its management, 
including the members of the Board of Directors, mem-
bers of the Supervisory Board and the statutory and 
non-statutory directors, aims to create a compensation 
and incentive plan adapted to the sustainable directing of 
the business, aligning the shareholders’ short and long-
term strategic interests with best market practices and 
corporate governance.
The Company has a Personnel, Governance, Organization 
and Culture Committee, which, amongst other duties, 
is responsible for periodically analyzing the fixed and 
variable remuneration strategy adopted, issuing its rec-
ommendations on such, as well as suggesting any pos-
sible modifications it feels should be implemented in the 
remuneration policy, for the consideration, decision and 
approval of the Board of Directors. The Company’s remu-
neration policy was approved by the Board of Directors on 
November 26, 2020, and is available to the shareholders, 
investors and the market in general on the Company’s 
Investor Relations websites (http://ri.brf-global.com) and 
that of the CVM.
99.95% of our employees 
receive formal performance 
evaluations (read about this 
in more detail in the Annex)
GRI 2-19, 2-20, 3-3: Material Topic (Attraction, 
development and retention of employees) 
All members of the Board of Directors receive fixed re-
muneration, involving 12 monthly payments, established 
in accordance with the applicable legislation and market 
standards. A remuneration different to that of the other 
members of the Board of Directors is established for the 
Chairperson, considering the function performed.
Whenever applicable, certain members of the Board of 
Directors may receive other sums relating to direct or 
indirect benefits, such as medical and dental assistance, 
life insurance, benefits relating to the termination of their 
exercising of the role (clauses set forth in the non-com-
pete contract), post-employment benefits such as a pri-
vate pension, a bonus for participation in committees, and 
long-term incentives (a remuneration plan based upon 
shares).

Training and Education GRI 404-1, 404-2
Aware of the importance of continued learning for the 
longevity of its business in a constantly evolving world, 
BRF offers qualifications, training and career transition 
programs to its employees at all company levels.
In 2022, the Company offered a total of 2,927,667.83 
hours of training, resulting in an average of 29.97 hours/
year per employee. The subjects covered include technical 
aspects of different functions and jobs, topics relating to 
sustainability, and issues of ethics, conduct, diversity and 
equality.
Created in 2018, the BRF Digital Academy offers manda-
tory and institutional training to employees from all areas 
and levels, involving 100% of our employees in 2022. In 
just five months, from its launch in August through until 
the beginning of 2023, the BRF Digital Academy recorded 
700,000 conclusions of more than 2,600 courses, which 
can be accessed via computer , tablet or smartphone.

Health and safety  
GRI 3-3: Material Topic (Health, welfare and safety),
403-1, 403-2, 403-4, 403-5, 403-7
BRF’s Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) management 
system, includes 91 regulatory documents, 68 corporate 
norms and 22 corporate instructions on the issue. Within 
these documents can be found directives for preventing 
and reducing accidents, incidents and losses, as well as 
the responsibilities regarding the management of the 
risks relating to human, equity, production, environmen-
tal and community preservation We have implemented 
indicators, work committees and procedures designed to 
investigate, mitigate and prevent accidents, as well as to 
engage employees on the matter , all of which are con-
sidered material by our stakeholders, who stressed their 
concern over the issue during the most recent materiality 
process. 
Also forming part of this management system are: the 
‘Risk Management Program’ (RMP), developed in ac-
cordance with international standards (ISO 31000); the 
‘Occupational Risk Management Program’ (ORMP); the 
‘Occupational Health Medical Control Program’ (PCMSO); 
the ‘Hearing Protection Program’ (HPP); the ‘Ergonomics 
Program’ (EP); the ‘Respiratory Protection Program’ (RPP); 
the ‘Management of Information on Legal Requirements’, 
and other routines and tools, such as the Mapping of Job 
Risks, the results of which are discussed every month by 
the Health and Safety Committees forming part of the 
senior management and technical areas, meaning we can 
monitor not only the end-indicators, but also the mid-indi-
cators during each stage of evolution.
Our work aimed at lowering the accident frequency rates 
is ongoing, as is that aimed at reducing the exposure to 
serious risks and events such as accidents involving time 
off work and fatalities. In this area, our technical team can 
count upon support from a specialist consultancy. We are 
now in a significantly more improved position than we 
were six years ago, within the positive benchmark rates 
for the frozen foods sector , but we are continuing to work 
towards achieving a frequency rate of 4%, in line with the 
international benchmark for segments such as that of 
consumer goods.
At BRF, our employees and service providers directly 
linked to the business are covered by the OHS manage-
ment system at at least one level, even when their work 
locations are not controlled by the Company. Our suppli-
ers are ratified in accordance with corporate norms which 
analyze their reputations and compliance with labor leg-
islation, whilst our agreements with them contain clauses 
related to maintenance of the health and safety of the 
workers. Furthermore, in the Commercial area, part of the 
routine of our sales consultants involves using the BRF 
Connect app to report any situations to their managers 
that they may observe when visiting their clients’ premises 
- ice accumulating on the floors of cold storage spaces or 
unsafe practices, for example. By doing so, the manager 
receiving the inputs can contact the client to address the 
issues.
Upon joining the Company, our employees are provided 
with guidance on the requirement to report any critical 
accidents, incidents or irregularities that they may wit-
ness, as well as inform their immediate supervisor or 
Internal Occupational Accident Prevention Commission 
(‘CIPA’) of any irregularities identified, whilst they also have 
the right to suggest improvements. The CIPA is composed 
of elected employees and recommended individuals who 
participate in strategic monthly meetings with senior 
management to better understand the risks and adopt 
control measures and means of preventing accidents and 
incidents. The group has full autonomy to suggest im-
provements and intervene in processes when any sort of 
risk is identified. 
Finally, we also have an Observation and Prevention 
Program, this being a tool to assist those employees 
who observe any sort of irregularity or unsafe behavior 
in approaching their colleague in a friendly manner , thus 
avoiding problems or reprisals and allowing for mutual 
care and continuous learning.
Through the offering of forums and meetings, every new 
employee is presented with the Health and Safety Policy 
and the Company’s Golden Rules. They are also instructed 
on the use, storage and maintenance of PPE (Personal 
Protective Equipment) and observation of the Emergen-
cy Response Plan (ERP). At the beginning of 2023, the 
Golden Rules were reviewed and simplified with the aim 
of facilitating their understanding and adoption in the 
day-to-day activities of our employees.
The employees working with special or high equipment 
or activities receive specific training in accordance with 
the relevant Regulatory Norms (RNs) and BRF’s internal 
directives.

Rates & accidents GRI 403-9
BRF is committed to implementing a culture of safety 
which, together with its employees, develops their percep-
tion of risk and thus promotes safer behavior . Some of our 
production plants have not had any accidents involving 
time off work for three years and we want this to be the 
case for all our other plants. 
A benchmark for the sector in occupational health and 
safety, the Company’s aim is to achieve this recognition in 
a broader sector than simply that of frozen foods, be-
coming a benchmark in the food and beverage market 
as a whole. To achieve this, we have involved an external 
consultancy to support us on this journey towards Zero 
Accidents. 
At BRF, all accidents are recorded in the internal system 
within 24 hours of the accident occurring. Following this, 
an investigative commission is created to collect evidence 
and analyze the causes of what has occurred, presenting 
this information to leadership committees. Depending 
upon the real and/or potential seriousness of the occur-
rence, a red alert is issued to the entire Company as a 
means of disseminating all that has been learned from 
the case. 
Of all the accidents that occurred in 2022, 53% were due 
to unsafe behavior and non-compliance with the proto-
cols on the part of the employees involved - a percentage 
that drops to 51% in the case of serious accidents. In the 
other 47%, the dominant factor was the conditions of risk 
present in the operation - the presence of water on the 
floor , for example.
Despite a reduction of 8 percentage points in the rate of 
frequency of accidents, last year saw an increase in the 
seriousness of accidents, both in terms of the number of 
serious accidents themselves and in the number of work-
ing days lost (see the table). In addition to this, four fatal 
accidents unfortunately occurred in 2022. Two of the vic-
tims were outsourced workers performing maintenance 
work at the Rio Verde (GO) production unit, when they 
were affected by an ammonia leakage. The third victim 
was one of our own employees working in the ingredi-
ents department, who suffered a serious accident at the 
Toledo (PR) plant. The fourth victim - also one of our own 
employees, working at the Concórdia (SC) production unit 
- suffered an accident causing a rupture of the tendon in 
his knee. This final death occurred following post-surgery 
complications, when the employee suffered a pulmonary 
problem during the recuperation process. 
The measures taken to eliminate other dangers and 
reduce the risks of accidents are the result of a diagnosis 
of High Potential Risks and the development of a plan 
together with the prioritized units. BRF has developed 
a pilot application of Computer Vision technology using 
Artificial Intelligence in the prevention of accidents and in-
cidents relating to intervention in moving machinery. Also 
of special note was the implementation of the Executive 
Operational Committee (EOC), which is focused on poten-
tial high risks related to more serious accidents.
Some BRF plants have not had any 
accidents for three years and we are 
working on a daily basis for this to also be a 
reality for all our other plants

Health care GRI 403-3, 403-6, 403-10
BRF adopts a preventative approach in its policy towards 
occupational health, directing its actions towards sup-
porting epidemiological studies developed as part of the 
continual collection of occupational health indicators. We 
have programs such as the Occupational Health Medical 
Control Program, Respiratory Protection and Hearing 
Conservation programs, which are geared to ensuring the 
integrity and wellbeing of our employees. Operation of 
the Occupational Health Medical Control Program is fully 
integrated with the Occupational Risk Management Pro-
gram, observing the agents of physical, chemical, biologi-
cal, ergonomic and accident-related risks.
Our employees’ access to medical and health care ser-
vices that are not related to work is provided, by the BRF 
Health Care Centers, in the form of a benefits package 
that includes pregnancy and new-born infants’ health 
care, vaccination campaigns, changes in lifestyles and a 
partnership with a gym app, amongst other advantages. 
In addition to this, the Company undertakes prevention 
campaigns related to sexually transmitted diseases, smok-
ing and alcoholism.

A benchmark in transportation 
safety
 
Our entire transport fleet is outsourced and 
equipped with a system designed to control 
driver fatigue. The Company requires not only 
that the partner transportation company has 
full control of this system, but also that they 
provide access and power to determine what 
will and will not be tolerated. Drivers involved 
in risky behavior (using a cellular phone whilst 
driving, for example), may be banned from 
working for BRF. Actions such as this have 
allowed the Company to achieve the lowest rate 
of transport accident frequency in its history.
Also deserving of note is the BRF Safety and 
Logistics Committee, which supervises the 
transportation not only of our products, but 
also of personnel and animals. The group 
meets monthly to share good practices and 
recommendations in response to accidents and 
incidents.
Also worthy of mention is the ‘Dr . BRF’ service, which pro-
vides medical advice over the telephone, offered free of 
charge and without limits on its use to all our employees 
and their families. The service is offered 24 hours per day, 
seven days per week, and during the virtual appointments 
the doctor can prescribe medicines, order exams, monitor 
symptomatic cases and, whenever necessary, forward the 
patient for treatment at an emergency unit.
In 2022, we recorded 248 cases of work-related ill health, 
including hearing loss and musculoskeletal illnesses, 
without any deaths being registered. BRF monitors and 
supports all of our employees impacted and is constantly 
reinforcing its controls and management of risks based 
upon these incidents, whilst always seeking to improve 
the processes to avoid the recurrence of these types 
of health problems. These data refer solely to our own 
employees, since the Company does not undertake any 
control of occupational illnesses amongst outsourced 
workers.

Diversity, equality and 
inclusion
 
The values of diversity, multiculturalism and plurality 
are an integral part of our history. As such, we work 
hard to ensure that our work environments are inclu-
sive, respectful and welcoming to all people, whilst we 
also work to ensure that they are spaces where discrim-
ination has no place.
The global area of Diversity and Inclusion, which is a 
strategic area for the Company, works on four fronts: 
raising awareness, attraction and retention, career 
development, and governance. 
BRF’s commitment to equal opportunities is broken 
down into a series of affirmative inclusion actions. Of 
special note in the engagement and awareness raising 
plan connected to this issue, is our network of more 
than 60 Diversity Ambassadors. Located throughout 
Brazil, they share their experiences, organize specific 
actions on commemorative dates and assist in the im-
plementation of pilot-projects.
Racial equality
BRF is one of the founding members of the Movement 
for Racial Equality (MOVER) that brings together more 
than 47 organizations from different sectors (which 
together employ more than 1.3 million people) with the 
mission to combat structural racism and promote racial 
equality. The participating companies have assumed 
a target of employing Black people in 10,000 leader-
ship positions by 2030 and to develop training actions 
designed to create better opportunities for another 
Foreigners and refugees
 
One of the biggest employers of foreigners 
in Brazil, BRF currently has around 5,000 em-
ployees in this category. The majority of these 
workers are also refugees, which is why the 
Company is amongst those organizations that 
most welcome professionals in this situation. To 
promote inclusion and integration, we employ 
operators who can translate, develop initiatives 
3 million Black workers. Another element of the MOVER 
mission involves raising the awareness of society in rela-
tion to structural racism and the debate concerning this 
issue.
Gender equality
BRF has been working to improve its indicators of female 
professional upward mobility. We ended the year with 
women holding 24% of the senior management positions, 
which is on course for achieving 30% by 2025. This target 
involves affirmative actions involving quotas in the educa-
tional incentives and development programs. 
Another highlight of note is the ‘Women in Focus’ pro-
gram. Created in 2021 in the form of a pilot in the 
Operations department, in 2022 it was extended into 
other areas of the Company. The aim is to reinforce the 
designed to validate diplomas and promote 
support networks in which the leaders of each 
community of foreigners support their recently 
arrived countrymen. To promote inclusion and 
belonging, BRF has created the Active Listening 
Program, which encourages dialog between 
those in refugee situations and the company, in 
order to understand the opportunities that exist 
and create action plans.
empowerment, technical knowhow and professional 
development of female employees, as well as allow for 
an exchange of experiences between professionals with 
different functions in different areas. 
Disabled persons
The greatest highlight for BRF in 2022 in relation to its 
actions concerning disabled persons was the ‘Leadership 
without Ableism’ program. Created in 2022, the aim of the 
initiative is to promote the appreciation of persons with 
disabilities within the Company.

Value Generation5
BRF is a company with enormous 
potential to create an impact. Through the 
business and our production chain, we 
are in contact with suppliers, integrated 
producers, clients, consumers, partners 
and organizations which assist the 
company in fulfillment of its reason for 
being and contribute to its evolution.
Over recent years, we have been working 
hard to strengthen our ability to generate 
results. We are on a learning journey 
to continue creating employment and 
income, whilst incorporating good 
practices related to our commitments to 
Integrity, Quality and Safety.
This chapter brings together indicators, 
projects and examples that demonstrate 
how we create and share value, starting 
with the relations constructed by the 
Company with the accessed capitals and 
the publics we impact, covering economic, 
environmental, social and governance 
issues (EESG).
Business performance
 
We have made a commitment to our shareholders, 
investors and society, to return the Company to it’s 
historic performance levels. In 2022, based upon a 
detailed and careful analysis of our business, we defined 
an efficiency plan, which, once having been implemented 
in the third quarter , had raised R$ 210 million by the close 
of the year .
As part of this plan, which began as part of BRF’s new 
shareholding and governance structure, we have 
adopted the foundations of simplicity, agility and 
efficiency. We reviewed our global footprint, adjusted our 
product portfolio, optimized our Capex, and engaged 
in maximizing the use of our assets, controlling our 
leverage, and improving our supply management.
We have made value captures of around R$ 130 million 
with the improvement of operational indicators, including 
mortality rates, food conversion and productivity. We have 
also reduced costs caused by inactivity of around R$ 50 
million and reviewed our logistics efficiency, as well as our 
transport, distribution and energy contracts. We improved 
the level of our logistics service by 8 percentage points 
(comparing Feb. 2023 x 2022).
We worked hard on the alternative grains consumption 
strategy (DDG, sorghum and oils), managing to avoid 
costs of around R$ 100 million over the year .
We made advances in our share of practically every 
category in Brazil. In the international market, we consol-
idated our leadership in Halal and received more than 30 
plant approvals for strategic markets, especially for Asia.

Indicators and performance 
 
In 2022, the net revenue reached R$ 53.8 billion, an 
increase of 11.3% in relation to the previous year . We 
saw a 2.8% increase in volumes, with an average price 
8.2% higher in relation to R$/kg. The price strategy 
and the greater volumes partially offset the general 
increase in costs, from grains to raw-materials, 
and the fluctuations in price of the exportation of 
products such as chicken meat.
The Adjusted EBITDA for the period was R$ 3.9 billion, 
29.9% below that of the previous year , with earnings 
being strongly impacted during the period (both 
gross and net), further reflecting the Company’s 
performance and operational adjustments. In 2022, 
the net revenue of the ongoing operations experi-
enced a loss of R$ 3.1 billion, and in the discontinued 
operations of R$ 51 million.
This occurred due to the termination of certain 
disputes related to losses incurred by entities sold in 
Europe and Thailand in 2018 and 2019, as well as tax 
contingencies relating to periods prior to the sales.
Our debt profile has remained long-term and 
balanced between currencies and diversification, with 
an average term of 8 years. We remain committed 
to increasing the generation of cash flow to reduce 
indebtedness and we have announced an asset 
demobilization plan totaling around R$ 4 billion;
Some of the highlights of our indicators are listed 
on the following page. In the second table, we 
also present the consolidated results from the 
management perspective - that is, eliminating the 
accounting effects of the hyperinflation experienced 
in Turkey (as detailed in explanatory note 3.5 in BRF’s 
Financial Statements, accessible here); the negative 
impact of the debt referred to as ‘hedge accounting’ 
in the sum of R$ 445 million in the net revenues of the 
international markets in the second quarter; and the 
impact of the Leniency Agreement, which totaled R$ 
583.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 (explan-
atory note 1.3).

Indebtedness
In 2022, BRF continued working on the restructuring 
of its debt, seeking ways of reducing its leverage in 
both the medium and short terms. We closed the 
year with a 16.8% higher Net Debt/EBITDA ratio, 
achieving 3.55x. The net indebtedness totaled R$ 
14,598 million at the end of the year , below the 
R$ 17,332 million in 2021. Our average debt term 
closed the last quarter at 8 years, 0.4 years less than 
in the third quarter of 2022. At the end of 2021, this 
level was 9 years. 
In line with our strategy of seeking to extend the 
debt profile in local currency, diversifying funding 
sources and optimizing the term/cost relations, we 
concluded some operations at the end of 2022, such 
as a rollover of R$ 400 million in export credit notes 
and the repurchase of US$ 41.9 million in bonds 
maturing in 2050, amongst other fundings in subsid-
iaries.
Another important operation was the subsequent 
equity offering (follow-on), priced in the first half of 
the year , in which the Company raised R$5.3 billion 
in order to strengthen the capital structure and 
support strategic investments. The offering was 
comprised of 270 million shares, involving both 
ordinary shares in Brazil and ADRs in the United 
States.

Performance of the markets
Brazil
In 2022, the domestic market scenario was directly 
affected by high inflation and high interest rates, 
which made price pass-throughs in the internal 
market difficult. Our net revenue increased by 8.8%. 
The Ebitda Margin was impacted by the increased 
pressure of costs of raw-materials, consumables, 
services and labor . Despite the fragile consumer 
scenario, we invested in our products, brands and 
innovations, achieving an evolution of margins in 
Brazil, gains in market share, a consolidation of our 
leadership in preference and record performance 
in our commemorative days campaign. Another 
highlight was our efforts to improve service levels, 
with more efficient logistics and regularity in 
execution for clients. We closed the year with a 
relevant base of clients in Brazilian retail, as well as 10 
‘Mercato Sadia’ chain stores.

International
The performance of the operations in 
the international segment was positive 
in many ways, with a rise of 13.4% in net 
revenue, gains of 13.4% in average prices 
and an increase of 9.2% in gross earnings. 
As a result, even under the inflationary 
pressures associated with challenging 
situations, such as the war in Ukraine, the 
increases in energy costs and raw materials, 
and inflationary or slowdown contexts in 
different regions, our Adjusted Ebitda was 
7.2% higher than in 2021. Take a look at the 
highlights per division:
Asia: there was downturn in net revenue, 
explained by lower export volumes to 
China and an appreciation of the Brazilian 
real, partially mitigated by higher prices 
of chicken meat for Japan, South Korea 
and China. The preparation of new plants 
for exportation is one of our response 
measures: we were awarded 6 new plant 
approvals for Singapore, Japan and China in 
2022.
Halal: the DDP Halal segment saw 
growth supported by the Adjusted Ebitda, 
influenced by a net operating revenue 
higher than the previous year . In this regard, 
we increased the volume of sales to the 
region, increased our share of products 
with aggregate value, and improved our 
price performance in the region, with 
fluctuations in the supply of local chicken 
meat. In Turkey, we continued to face 
a very challenging scenario involving 
hyperinflation, in which in 12 months 
accumulated inflation reached 64.27%. In 
the GCC, we performed well in volume of 
sales, which, in the fourth quarter , with an 
impressive rise specifically in processed 
foods (17.5%).
Direct exports: Covering markets to which 
we export fresh products, cuts of aggregate 
value and processed foods in general, this 
segment closed 2022 with a increase in net 
revenue, with a higher share of aggregate 
value products and price gains for the GCC 
and Americas regions, due to events such 
as the war in Ukraine and outbreaks of bird 
flu in the United States, which led to better 
prices for markets such as Mexico and 
Chile. We should also highlight the increase 
in plant approvals in new geographical 
regions.

International highlights
World Cup
During the period of this event, held in Qatar , we were present at all 
points of contact with our consumers, with actions that covered more 
than 66% of the main self-service stores in the Brazilian market.
Our presence also made a significant difference in the GCC. We 
invested in digital media actions with the participation of local 
influencers, whilst we were also present at the locations where the 
event was being held with our Sadia brand, promoting products of 
high added value - snacks and finger foods, for example, breaded 
chicken sticks, nuggets and hamburgers. 
We gained important exposure through our sponsorship of Beln 
Sports, the exclusive World Cup broadcaster . Furthermore, we invested 
in the activation of points of sale to stimulate sales in the processed 
foods portfolio. In digital and social media, we managed to reach 31.8 
million people.
Priorities for the international operation 
•  To strive for greater resilience in exports, with 
the diversification and expansion of markets
•  To achieve greater efficiency in all areas
•  To aggregate value to the products - a target 
which will also protect the results from greater 
fluctuation in prices which is a tendency in fresh 
foods
•  To supply increasingly more items that provide 
the consumer with convenience

Other segments
Our Ingredients division boasts a number of differentials and has pursued a 
positive trajectory showing the good performance of other segments, which 
experienced an 8.2% higher Adjusted Ebitda and a 33.9% rise in net revenue. By 
having as a source of raw-material used in the manufacturing of ingredients in 
its production chain, BRF has a distinct competitive advantage in this market. 
The Company has added value to the segment, with plant certifications for 
the exportation of products being awarded in 2022 and production expansion 
actions under way.  
Two product categories are important for this division: hydrolyzed products, 
obtained from beef bones and cartilage and which have a high aggregate value; 
and pharmaceuticals, with products such as heparin, an anticoagulant produced 
from beef mucous. 
In 2022, we also achieved positive performance with BRF Pet, which rose to third 
position in the Brazilian animal feed market, feeding more than 3.6 million of 
the country’s pets. Aiming to recover the Company's results, and invest in the 
core business, the sale of this division was announced at the beginning of 2023.

Suppliers and the 
production chain  GRI 2-6, 204-1
As a global company, BRF has an extensive chain of 
suppliers made up of partners with a wide range of 
profiles - from supplies, logistics and commodities to 
integrated producers. The Company closed 2022 with 
more than 9,500 integrated agricultural producers and 
approximately 30,000 suppliers, including centers and 
branch units. 
Of this total, we have 14,635 providers in the Supplies 
category, whilst in that of commodities, we had 1,594 last 
year , including rural producers, farmers, cooperatives, 
traders and retailers, as well as other categories.  
Over the course of the year , the good results in the 
execution of the budget, guided by digital and integrated 
price control, economic variations and relations between 
supply and demand, allowed us to minimize the impacts 
of expenses relating to production costs in this important 
link of the chain.
In relation to integrated producers, we are guided by a 
combination of integrity, compliance, economic and social 
impact, mutual development and long-term relations to 
expand the engagement and awareness of our sustaina-
bility ambitions.
 In 2022, BRF’s volume of purchases with domestic 
suppliers (Brazil), which we consider to be ‘local’, was 
90.81% in relation to the total budgeted in the period.

GRI 3-3: Material Topic (Management, transparency and traceability of 
the supply chain) 308-1, 308-2, 408-1, 409-1, 414-1, 414-2, FP1
We take an integrated approach to the management of 
the chain. Different processes, management policies and 
directives that cover the issue are supervised by a struc-
tured system of governance, using guidelines that range 
from advisory committees to the Board of Directors and 
which are the direct responsibility of Vice-Presidencies 
and the directors of the Supply and Farming areas - with 
EESG programs and initiatives that also involve teams 
from areas such as Sustainability and Compliance.
Our evolution in partner management involves the 
incorporation of socio-environmental premises and, in 
2022, 100% of our 696 new partners were selected based 
on this criteria. We have a Chain Monitoring Program, 
which covers operations from the purchase of grains 
through freight and logistics services, involving quality 
audits, actions designed to disseminate the BRF Business 
Partners’ Code of Conduct, consultations of public data 
and contractual requirements. The requirements and 
processes are:
Code of Conduct for BRF Business Partners: dissemi-
nation of the document, which establishes the rules and 
ethical and socio-environmental behavior expected of 
those who work with us.
Public lists: once a fortnight, we cross-check the infor-
mation contained in the public lists of entities such as the 
Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable 
Natural Resources (Ibama), the Ministry of Labor and 
Employment (MTE), and the National Register of the 
Disreputable and Suspended Companies (Ceis), with the 
aim of identifying suppliers which are not in compliance. 
Should irregularities be found, their registration is 
blocked for future business, until their situation has been 
regularized and they have been awarded a clearance 
certificate.
Human rights and labor practices:: we have a HUMAN 
RIGHTS CORPORATE POLICY and we aim to curb any 
occurrence of labor in degrading or forced conditions, 
or conditions that are no compatible with human dignity, 
especially child labor . 
Animal welfare: this is an essential theme in our 
relations, from integrated producers to our dialog with 
transport service and logistics providers, involving all 
those who have contact with live animals.
Self-assessment: all of our suppliers have to fill out a

checklist/questionnaire addressing technical information.
One of our policies is to distribute our Business Partners’ 
Code of Conduct, Transparency Manual and Corporate 
Policy on Human Rights amongst our suppliers and 
partners. As well as covering the guarantee of human 
rights, these regulatory documents contain specific guide-
lines on our position in relation to child labor , forced labor 
or labor analogous to slavery - guidelines which must be 
rigorously complied with. 
We closed the year with 100% of BRF’s volume of 
purchases made from suppliers who are in compliance 
with the company’s norms and directives in relation to 
social, environmental and human rights aspects.
Of the 35,225 partners assessed in social aspects, three 
were identified as causing significant real or potential 
negative social impacts, with whom we needed to 
establish improvement plans. In relation to the socio-en-
vironmental issue, we also assessed 35,225 suppliers. 
Fifteen of them were identified as causing negative 
impacts and, of these, we have outlined improvement 
plans for five partners. Also during the year , we ended 
relations with 189 suppliers which presented real or 
potential negative environmental impacts, representing 
3.3% of the base. 
Development of integrated producers
In 2022, we had approximately 9,500 integrated 
producers working on animal farming. The controls and 
governance relating to the partners involve evaluations of 
compliance analyzing whether they should be included in 
the definition of a Politically Exposed Person and whether 
there exist any conflicts of interest (corporate relationship 
or kinship with BRF employees and/or suppliers, for 
example). We also apply actions to them in the sphere of 
the Chain Monitoring Program, relating to sustainability, 
compliance, legal compliance and human rights. 
In the environmental sphere, we have an  area specifically 
working on control and management in order to monitor 
suppliers together with extension workers, these being 
employees linked to livestock farming who make periodic 
visits to rural properties focused on the production of 
animals forming part of our chain. The issues of animal 
welfare, that are central to compliance in our chain, are 
ratified by audits, certification programs and commit-
ments linked to our Sustainability Plan (read more in 
Animal Welfare).
In 2022, we trained around 750 extension workers, 
focusing on work methodologies and expansion of 
the business’ economic vision. One example of an 
action along these lines took place in May, in the form 
of a conference to which more than 70 supervisors 
brought external speakers to address the business and 
relationship vision, with the ultimate aim of expanding 
sustainability throughout our production chain.
The stability in the relationship with the Company could 
be clearly seen in the results of the Satisfaction Survey 
undertaken with our integrated producers. Involving 
voluntary participation by 5,229 producers (a number 
corresponding to 55% of the total), the study recorded an 
approval index of 84.25% (higher than the 84% recorded 
in 2021). This result reinforced BRF’s relationship and 
integration strategy with its principal stakeholder in the 
area of farming. We operate in line with the Integration 
Law (in effect since May 2016), in such a way that its 
application takes into consideration the due roles, respon-
sibilities and attributes of each (integrator or integrated) 
player in the main elements of the system. 
Another important highlight of the year was the 
expansion of our payment policies based upon zootech-
nical performance - thus encouraging our integrated 
producers to continue with their efforts to optimize and 
modernize their activities. 
In August 2022, BRF took part in the 2022 edition of the 
International Poultry and Pork Show (SIAVS). At the event, 
our integrated producers had the opportunity to take 
part in forums of interest to them, involving speakers 
on new technologies, clean energy and animal welfare 
practices. Furthermore, during the event, 49 partners 
received awards from the ‘5 Star Integrated Highlight’ 
program, which, now in its 15th edition, recognizes the 
best integrated producers in each of BRF’s production 
segments. 
100% 
of our integrated producers 
were included in the sphere of the Chain 
Monitoring Program, relating to sustainability, 
compliance, legal compliance and human rights.

Management of the logistics chain
Another important group of suppliers is the cargo trans-
portation providers, including both live cargo (animals 
for farming and slaughter), raw-materials, consum-
ables and finished products. We have more than 22,700 
partners (drivers and assistants) traveling more than 50 
million kilometers per month in more than 50 countries 
in Europe, South Africa, Middle East, Asia, Americas and 
Brazil. 
We have an Integrated Management of Suppliers 
Program (GIF), an initiative that recognizes the perfor-
mance of our partners in the form of annual awards. In 
addition to this is the Health, Safety and Environment 
in Transport Program (SSMA), the role of which is to 
reduce accidents and environmental impacts, combat the 
sexual exploitation of children and young people on the 
highways and ensure dignity in the performance of the 
truck driving profession. 
With the support of an independent company, we control, 
monitor and manage the routines of these transport 
professionals that are linked to the issue of personnel 
management - such as, for example, vacations, admis-
sions, dismissals and legal documentation such as the 
Occupational Health Certificate (ASO), toxicology exam 
and Brazilian Driving License (CNH). We also adopt 
technologies for purposes such as monitoring fatigue to 
ensure compliance with the routines, and we have made 
important advances, such as, for example, a reduction in 
the accident rate (read more in Health and Safety).
Also forming part of the responsibilities of the 
independent company is the monitoring of the leading 
indicators related to personnel (such as turnover and 
absenteeism) and climate studies aimed at identifying 
opportunities for improvement and greater appreciation 
and recognition for the workers employed by these trans-
portation companies. Also worth mentioning is the fact 
that BRF monitors the individual conduct of the drivers, 
whose ratings may be reduced or they may be prevented 
from working for BRF for periods of between 15 days and 
a year , should they be found to have committed irregular-
ities whilst providing services to the Company.
BRF has more than 22,700 partners operating 
in the cargo transportation area. Distributed 
throughout Brazil and in more than 50 
countries in Europe, South Africa, Middle East, 
Asia and Americas, they cover more than 50 
million kilometers per month

Grains Treceability and Socio-
environmental Monitoring. 
Material Topic (Management, transparency and traceability of the 
supply chain)
We advanced in our socioenvironmental and deforest-
ation monitoring of the grains (corn, soy and sorghum) 
used in our feed production. We pay special attention 
to the Amazon and Cerrado biomes, where the risks of 
deforestation, impacts on biodiversity, and other environ-
mental and social risks are recurring problems affecting 
different production chains.
In 2022, besides the advances in the traceability of our 
direct suppliers, we started the traceability and socioenvi-
ronmental monitoring of indirect suppliers. These present 
a particular challenge, not only for BRF, but for the entire 
commodities sector . 
We achieved 100% treaceability and socioenvironmental 
monitoring of our direct suppliers from the Amazon and 
Cerrado biomes to farm level. For indirect suppliers, we 
achieved 45% treaceability in the same criteria. By doing 
so, we achieved 61% of our commitment to “Ensure 
treaceability of 100% of the grains purchased from 
Amazon and Cerrado biomes by 2025”, in the second year 
of the implementation process. 
To be more transparent with our stakeholders in 
relation to the criteria used in the monitoring process, 
we published the Sustainable Grain Purchase Policy. 
Suppliers that are non-compliant with our Policy are 
preventively blocked, and then contacted to provide 
clarifications about the non-conformities found. In 2022, 
we blocked 189 suppliers from our historical base from 
future negotiations. The main reason for the blocking was 
due to the appearance on Ibama’s Embargoes List.
100%
 of the volumes purchased 
from the Amazon and Cerrado
 biomes are monitored using 
socio-environmental criteria and 
deforestation at Farm Level.
To evaluate cases of non-compliance with the criteria of 
our Policy, in 2021, we created the Grains Sustainability 
Multidisciplinary Committee.  Composed of the Commod-
ities, Reputation and Sustainability, Legal and Compliance 
teams, the Committee is responsible for the decision-
making on whether to continue or end the relationship 
with these partners, by evaluating the associated risks. 
In 2022, 14 cases were evaluated by the Committee, of 
which 10 were blocked and/or had their negotiations 
terminated, whilst with the other four we reached agree-
ments for improvements as a result of the evaluation. 
1  Direct suppliers: deliver directly to BRF, as is the case with rural producers.
2  Indirect suppliers: these are intermediaries in the purchase and sale process, 
involving traders, cooperatives, cereal farmers, crushers and other business 
entities.
3  Historical base: all the suppliers of grains already registered in the BRF 
database.

BRF Institute 
GRI 3-3: Material Topic (Food safety)  GRI 203-1, 203-2
The BRF Institute (IBRF) is a private association of public 
interest, founded by BRF to strategically channel the 
Company's social investments. The IBRF is responsible 
for managing the BRF Corporate Volunteer Program 
and for the entire BRF social intelligence area, defining 
the strategies for social investment in the different 
regions, especially where there are productive units, and 
acting with the different business areas to find oppor-
tunities for the promotion of a positive social impact in 
the communities and society as a whole through two 
strategic lines: “Food that Transforms” and “Education 
for the Future”.
The BRF Institute is supported in its operations both by 
means of its own resources, provided by BRF, and by the 
guidance provided by the investment of tax-deducted 
funds obtained through state laws. Its activities undergo 
The priority social investment pillars are:
> Food that T ransforms> Education for the Future
Our employees, service providers and integrated 
producers form an extensive chain that brings quality 
foods to the public’s tables every day. To this enormous 
impact can be added actions employed by the Company 
together with the communities neighboring its activities - 
the objective of which is to promote local development.
In 2022, 27 of the Company's units developed programs 
focused on the needs of the communities of which they 
form a part, identified by means of communities and 
processes of consultation together with the community. 
These actions are led by the BRF Institute. All of the 
units have socio-environmental impact evaluations, work 
councils, OHS commissions and formal processes for 
receiving complaints from the local communities.
In the area of Corporate Affairs, we perform engagement 
actions that involve meetings in which the BRF senior 
management takes part, dialogs with authorities and 
representatives of the local government and business 
community, as well as meetings with the operational 
teams of private institutions and companies. The 
actions involve three pillars: constructing long-term 
relationships; working on the proposing and discussion 
of public policies; or acting in reaction to emergency 
and/or critical situations, such as crises of image or 
reputation, or emerging agendas. In these cases, we 
can work directly or through sector entities, depending 
upon the issues in question.
Highlighted by our stakeholders during the process 
that resulted in BRF’s current materiality (read more 
on page 4), the issue of food safety is addressed in 
the commitments made in the BRF Sustainability Plan 
and is amongst the priorities of the Company's social 
impact programs. Our aim is to promote education 
on reducing food waste amongst 1.5 million people 
globally. Furthermore, we are committed to the health-
iness agenda, which impacts our customers - hence the 
importance of product lines that stand out. We track 
the efficacy of our measures by means of nutritional 
improvement indicators as well as impact indicators 
from the BRF Institute (such as those that are the result 
of projects such as ‘Food that Transforms’).

Volunteering and Corporate Citizenship
As well as the program themes, we also remain 
committed to the BRF Volunteer Program, which aims to 
connect our team with the communities where we have 
operations. In 2022, we once again started to implement 
intensive volunteer actions, with more than 3,000 volun-
teers from amongst the BRF employees, who participated 
in the BRF Institute’s 416 actions in 49 municipalities. 
More than 50,000 people benefited from these actions. 
In total, 13,400 hours were dedicated to the Program, 
which involved more than 230 social organizations with 
actions focused on issues such as education, food and 
the needs of the local communities. The focus of the 
actions performed were the thematic axes of the IBRF 
(an education actions campaign in April, another focused 
on food in October , and on Christmas in December) as 
well as the most pressing needs of the BRF municipalities 
(cleaning rivers, blood donations, and income campaigns, 
amongst others).
 Food that Transforms
This front involves programs and projects aiming to 
promote entrepreneurship and socioeconomic inclusion, 
education in order to reduce waste and encourage the 
conscientious consumption of food, guaranteeing their 
access to the communities where BRF is active. 
In 2022, we continued with a number of programs, 
including the Gastromotiva Community Kitchens Program, 
the Ecco Communities Program, and the Periphery 
Cookery Training Program, impacting 11 municipalities 
in the states of Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Minas Gerais, 
Pernambuco, Bahia, Goiás, Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso 
do Sul.
Furthermore, we established a new partnership with the 
‘Comida Invisível’ startup, to pursue a nationwide action 
focused on education for the reduction of food waste, 
using the ‘Comida Invisível Educa’ platform.
We also continued our research partnership with the José 
Egydio Setúbal Foundation. Amongst the highlights in 
2022, we saw the publication of works and articles on the 
research performed in 2021 concerning the food loss and 
waste situation. A new study on the scenario of private 
social investment and food safety was also undertaken, 
the results of which are to be published in 2023.
an annual financial audit. The governing body is made 
up of a meeting of associates, an Audit Committee and 
a board made up of the CEO and the Executive Board. 
There is a technical staff focused solely on the associa-
tion’s activities, which maintains an ongoing dialog with 
BRF’s stakeholders and management. 
As well as this focused staff, the BRF Institute manages 
and includes the operation of the Social Investment 
Committees, groups of employees at the production 
units, administrative offices and distribution centers with 
the aim of mediating the local social investment actions, 
ensuring this form of volunteer engagement, and the 
importance and legitimacy of the initiatives implemented.
The initiatives focused on the communities follow a series 
of corporate directives, including the Social Investment, 
Corporate Volunteer and Institutional Relations Regula-
tions, as well as the Sustainability, Donations and 
Sponsorships, and Human Rights Policies.

Education for the Future
In this area, the focus of our projects is access to 
quality education, the encouragement of entrepre-
neurship, and inclusion in the work market. In 2022, 
we established partnerships with organizations such 
as the Ayrton Senna Institute, UNICEF, Visão Mundial, 
Digital House and the Gama Academy, to ensure 
educational support, access to the internet, and 
the socio-emotional and cognitive development of 
students in vulnerable situations. We also supported 
training for migrants, refugees and disabled persons.
Combating waste at home
Promoting education starts at home, with pilot projects 
implemented in the restaurants of our installations with the 
assistance of behavioral psychology concepts. One of the tools 
that we have employed as part of this agenda is the totems 
installed in the manufacturing units (and which form part of the 
Ecco Platform) to provide the employees with tips on tackling 
waste. We also performed actions in 29 canteens operated by 
partners such as Industrial Social Services (Sesi), focused on 
the comprehensive use of food, reaching more than 40,000 
employees with content concerning cutting food waste.

Animal welfare 
GRI 3-3: Material Topic (Animal welfare), SASB- FB-MP-430a.2
BRF’s global animal welfare program establishes guide-
lines that ensure management of this issue together with 
integrated producers and employees in all countries where 
we are present. Furthermore, the BRF Sustainability Plan 
involves 11 commitments related to this issue which are 
connected to international benchmarks and challenges 
facing the sector . In 2022, we invested more than R$ 41 
million in animal welfare (BEA), including R$ 8 million in our 
proprietary farms, and R$ 33 million through incentives for 
integrated producers for structural alterations designed to 
meet our commitment to collective gestation.
We have adopted the concept of the five domains of 
Animal welfare an evolution of the Five Animal Freedoms 
established by the Farm Animal Welfare Committee (FAWC), 
which include not only physiological aspects, but also the 
behavior and mental states of the animals. We have a 
zero-tolerance policy concerning animal mistreatment, with 
public targets, commitments, team training, protocols and 
ongoing improvements in farming and slaughter practices.
The governance related to this issue ranges from senior 
management (by means of discussions within the Sustain-
ability Committee that advises the Board of Directors) to 
the directors involved in the farm and industrial operations. 
Considered to be a material topic by our stakeholders, as 
demonstrated in the materiality process performed (read 
more on page 4), animal welfare at BRF involves audits, 
inspections, checklists, analyses of cases of non-com-
pliance, technical committees, compliance standards, 
training and awareness-raising, and actions involving the 
integrated producers. 
Five Animal Freedoms
1.  Nutrition
Proper consumption of 
nutritious food for a pleasant 
experience.
2.  Environment
Good conditions that offer 
comfort and safety.;
3.  Health
Animal care procedures for 
robustness and vitality;
4.  Behavior
Varied activities and rewarding 
challenges;
5.  Mental state
Prioritizing comfort, interest 
and trust to avoid negative 
experiences

2022 Integrated  
Report
To gauge the challenges and the progress we have made 
in this area, we have adopted the Compliance Matrix in 
Animal Welfare, which crosses compliance with current 
laws and regulations and international protocols, and 
applies it to the slaughter of swine and poultry and to the 
farming of broiler chickens and turkeys, and swine These 
analyses are performed in the sphere of Animal Welfare 
Management, which involves teams of veterinarians. 
Added to this formal structure are various tactical working 
groups and committees with representatives from the 
Quality, Supply, Planning and Operations, Regulatory and 
Farming departments. In 2022, the scope of application 
of this tool came to include the poultry and swine repro-
duction chains. 
BRF’s production chain includes chickens (Brazil and 
Turkey), broiler turkeys  (Brazil and Turkey) and swine 
(Brazil), produced under the supervision and control of 
BRF. The raw materials of animal origin (beef and dairy 
products, as well as industrial use eggs) are sourced from 
ratified suppliers who have to meet the animal welfare 
requirements set forth in the CODE OF CONDUCT FOR 
BRF BUSINESS PARTNERS.
Furthermore, since 2019, BRF’s animal welfare officials 
have used samples to perform more than 9,000 assess-
ments of integrated producers from the broiler chicken, 
broiler turkey and swine chains. In 2022, around 2,500 
integrated producers (or 26.3% of the properties in our 
chain) were assessed. The units have the autonomy 
to perform monthly self-assessments, whilst they also 
undergo second-party audits performed by a corporate 
team, some of which also include audits by clients and 
certifying entities. 
Over the course of the year , 100% of our broiler chicken, 
turkey and swine abattoirs underwent a total of 376 
assessments in relation to the criteria of receipt and 
slaughter of live animals. All cases of non-compliance 
identified were monitored and addressed by the welfare 
officials at each unit. 
Since 2021, we have also been moving forward in our 
mapping of suppliers of raw materials of animal origin, 
in order to understand the methods used in farming, 
slaughter , certification, mutilation and environmental 
improvement adopted in their chains. To do this, the 
Animal Welfare Management department uses question-
naires to monitor those partners which produce beef and 
lactose products. 
Certified production of animal 
welfare 
SASB-FB-MP-410a.3
Currently, 87.5% of swine are slaughtered 
at units certified to third parties, through 
the North America Meat Institute protocol, 
representing an advance of 50% on the 
indicator compared to 2021. This index 
reached 77.4% in broiler chickens (with 
the National Chicken Council’s protocol 
being adopted in this chain), an advance 
of 9% in relation to 2021. The audits are 
conducted by professionals approved by the 
Professional Animal Auditor Certification 
Organization (PAACO).
In 2022, five new poultry and swine 
slaughter processes were certified and the 
others were recertified - at the Uberlândia 
(MG) (poultry and pigs), Lucas do Rio Verde 
(MT), Dourados (MS) and Chapecó (SC) units. 
Indeed, this final unit was certified in animal 
welfare by the National Turkey Federation, 
the first certification for turkeys. 
In the field, our production processes are 
continually checked and audited by our 
clients and by international entities. More 
details can be found in the BRF Quality 
chapter .

Everyone engaged in animal welfare
Our animal welfare officials perform and increase qualifi-
cation in this area of 100% of the employees, third parties 
and producers who work with live animals, from the 
incubation units and semen centers through to slaughter . 
Furthermore, we are attending to the increased interest 
being shown by our consumer public, by broadcasting 
webseries and publishing material on the company's 
social media, and including the issue in brand communi-
cations, especially in EESG focused categories, such as the 
Sadio BIO and Sadia Organic lines.

With the aim of improving our indicators and perfor-
mance, we operate in line with the GLOBAL G.A.P . and 
Certified Humane standards.
We work to limit the duration of the transportation of 
live cargo to a maximum of 8 hours (less than the time 
required by law). A working committee involving the 
Sustainability, SSMA, Operations and Farming teams 
performs inspections and aims to implement good 
practices in risk or accident situations.
Mention should also be made of the use of good 
quality poultry bedding, with a depth of 15cm for 
turkeys and 10cm for chickens. They are composed 
of shavings and/or rice husks, and are entirely free 
of contaminants. The bedding allows the animals 
to behave naturally, including scratching and taking 
powder baths. As well as the bedding, all turkeys have 
access to pecking objects for them to be able to fully 
express their natural behavior
All swine and turkeys are stunned prior to slaughter , 
guaranteeing a state of unconsciousness through until 
the end of the bleeding process.

All of our commitments related to management of 
the life cycles of poultry and swine (from breeding to 
slaughter) are in compliance with the five fundamental 
freedoms, zootechnical parameters, and the animals’ 
conditions of environmental comfort and welfare.
Stocking density, number of feeders and drinking 
troughs, heating and cooling systems, water quality 
and quantity, nutritional levels and environmental 
control, humidity, ventilation, temperature, lighting 
and bedding quality are some of the features that are 
monitored periodically. BRF has a very intense creation 
process, or in other words, the animals are farmed 
in installations without access to external areas, or , 
subsequently, to grazing. The exception to this is in 
Sadia’s organic line, which differs in that the poultry 
have access to an external area, following organic 
farming standards.

100% of our fertile egg producing poultry 
are cage free with access to a nest, 
a necessary structure for the animals to 
be able to express their natural behavior.
Poultry SASB-FB-MP-410a.2
Space for movement: We stipulate a maximum density 
for the housing of poultry (both in our own installations 
and in those of our integrated partners) of 39 kg/m², in 
line with European directives, considered to be one of the 
best in the world. Around 52% of broiler chickens farmed 
by BRF globally are slaughtered with a density of less than 
30 kg/m².
Cage free: 100% of the fertile egg production centers are 
cage free with access to a nest, a necessary structure for 
the animals to be able to express their natural behavior . 
BRF does not produce eggs for sale, something which 
occurs only in the case of infertile eggs. Whatever the 
case, all eggs that do come to be sold are classified as 
cage free. 
Feeding: broiler chickens have free access to water and 
feed prepared by nutritionists according to the needs of 
each phase of the animal’s development.
Correct temperature: we maintain conditions of 
thermal comfort for the animals through the use of 
special equipment, and the maximum and minimum 
temperatures and humidities of the installations are 
recorded every day for control and monitoring purposes.
Rest time: we respect a minimum of 8 hours of light per 
day and four hours of dark, thus following the day/night 
rhythm and the proper light intensity for each phase of 
the animal, in each farming system.
Beak trimming: we use laser equipment (instead of a 
cutting and cauterizing system) on 100% of our turkeys, 
as well as on the broiler chicken breeding hens, whilst 
respecting the limit of removing a maximum of 1/3 of the 
upper beak, with this being performed just once in an 
animal’s life.
Respect for regional criteria: we also respect the 
specific cultural, religious and market demands of our 
clients and certifications.
Cage-free turkeys: no turkey farmed by BRF globally is 
confined in a cage, meaning all of them enjoy freedom of 
movement within the installation.
Fattening turkeys: around 87% of the animal fattening 
processes are performed in a system of conventional 
housing, with open curtains thus making maximum use 
of natural light. The other installations operate with a 
different type of system that allows greater control over 
the environmental variables, such as temperature and 
humidity.
Poultry transportation: the transportation of turkeys 
and chickens is performed in accordance with the 
directives of the Corporate Committee on Live Cargo 
Transportation.
Assessment and management: all vehicles are checked 
as soon as they arrive at the factory, and the management 
is performed by professionals trained in animal welfare.

Freedom at the installations: in accordance with 
European directives, considered to be amongst the 
best in the world, all BRF fattening pigs have freedom 
of movement. The maximum stocking density of pigs at 
our installations and at those of our integrated partners 
should follow the vertical system of 0.33kg/m² for the 
nursery and 0.95m²/100kg for pigs in the termination 
phase. 
Weaning; the minimum weaning age should be 21 days, 
with an average age of 25 days.
Vaccinations without needles: The Lucas do Rio Verde 
(MT) unit implemented a system of vaccinations without 
the use of needles, meaning less stress for the animals.

swine Tail docking
100% of the animals farmed under BRF’s global integration 
system have their tails docked by the third day of life. This 
process is still necessary to maintain the animals’ welfare, 
avoiding the risk of cannibalism during the growth and 
fattening phases. We are working to develop an analgesic 
that will reduce any type of discomfort caused during the 
procedure.
Castration: in 2022, BRF achieved another of its public 
commitments in relation to the reduction of physical alter-
ations in swine From December 2022 on, no swine has 
been submitted to surgically castrated without anesthetic. 
Roughly 1% of male pigs intended for the production of 
Parma ham are subjected to surgical castration. Following 
more than two years of experiments, we have begun to 
produce Prosciutto without the need to surgically castrate 
the animals. In the rare cases in which surgical castration 
is still necessary (around 0.17%), it will be performed with 
anesthetic.
Collective gestation: we have adopted a system of 
collective gestation as mandatory in all of our expansion 
projects and we are committed to implementing collective 
gestation pens for 100% of our breeding sows by 2026 
In 2022, the adaptation of more than 16,500 positions 
meant that we reached the sum of 53.4% - a rate that we 
intend to raise to 56.3% in 2023.
Since December 2022, none 
of our swine have been 
surgically castrated without

Medicines
In relation to the use of antibiotics and medicines in 
general, BRF operates in accordance with the scientific 
evidence of antimicrobial resistance in the human 
population and with the understanding of the World 
Health Organization (WHO), that classifies antimicrobials 
in three categories: critically important, highly important 
and important. 
Our team of veterinarians evaluates and ensures 
the biosecurity, animal welfare prophylaxis, disease 
prevention, and maintenance of animal health, constantly 
seeking alternatives to the use of these drugs in the 
form of vaccines, prebiotics and probiotics. Furthermore, 
hormones to increase growth in the integration of poultry 
and swine are not used. 
In the BRF global poultry chain, we do not use antibiotics 
classified by the World Health Organization as harmful to 
human health, and we are working to reduce the use of 
this class of medicines in the pig chain.
We only make use of antimicrobials for therapeutic 
purposes, under the evaluation of veterinarians, and only 
when injuries have been observed. All the processes are 
noted on the lot’s monitoring sheet. All the products are 
purchased and supplied by BRF, and integrated producers 
are forbidden from privately using or acquiring them 
themselves. The grace periods are rigorously observed 
and inspected by the BRF team, with no waste in the 
meat. In the Sadio Bio line, we do not use any medicines 
in the animal farming, with this process being certified by 
a third party.
In 2022, the use of antibiotics in broiler chickens stood 
at 4.08mg for every kilogram of chicken meat produced, 
meaning a 73% increase compared to 2021. In the 
production of pigs, there was a modest increase of 2.83% 
in the use of antibiotics for each kilogram produced. In 
the production of turkeys, the amount remained stable.

Innovation in 
sanitary quality 
In 2022, as part of our maturing process and 
evolution in the Quality System (read more 
here), we made a series of advances relating 
to the control and monitoring of indicators 
and processes in the production chain. Some 
highlights were:
>  Establishment of new vaccination 
protocols in the breeding sow areas and in 
the broiler chicken incubation units
>  Development of assessment of products 
that can be used as alternatives to 
antibiotics
>  Use of Artificial Intelligence in the 
prediction of sanitary agents, combining 
good production practices with technical 
indicators
>  Revision of all our biosafety controls, 
contributing to the country’s negative 
status in relation to Avian Influenza and 
Newcastle disease
>  Undertaking of a series of training 
sessions for technical teams working in the 
field

Environmental management
We have a complex system of environmental 
management to be able to gauge impacts, the use of 
resources, and performance and compliance indicators 
in our industrial plants and administrative opera-
tions around the world. We are fully committed to the 
protection of the environment, the management of water 
and the fight against climate change.
Our activities in this area are guided by our Sustainability 
Policy and our Policy for Health, Safety and Environment 
(HSE), as well as regulations such as the ISO 14001, 
programs such as the ‘Mais Excelência’ (+Excellence) and 
‘Operational Excellence System’ (OES) programs, and by 
laws and regulations to ensure that we are constantly 
striving for efficiency in our activities. 
To ensure execution of the environmental management 
system, our governance in relation to this topic involves 
local HSE teams at all the units and operations, and 
tactical committees involving managers and leaders 
with responsibilities being clearly assigned in relation 
to environmental controls. One example of this is 
the Water Steering Committee, which is focused on 
encouraging actions of water resource management 
in the operation (read more on the following pages). The 
Animal Welfare Committee is another instrument of 
governance concerning animal welfare that covers a 
number of different environmental issues connected to 
the management, farming and slaughter of animals (read 
more on page 94).
We have an Environmental Sustainability Index (ESI) that 
is used as an indicator for monitoring the protection 
of the environment and our performance in relation to 
effluents, waste, emissions, noise, smell and compliance 
with environmental authorizations and licensing. The ESI 
environmental indicators, as well as gauging the industrial 
and farming units in Brazil, Abu Dhabi and Turkey, also 
apply as a pilot project to our grain units. 
In 2022, compliance with the ESI reached 93.6%, with the 
forecast target having been 93%. This indicator varies in 
accordance with any updating that is made to the legal 
requirements and renewals of the environmental licenses. 
Between 2014 and 2022 we invested a total of € 427 
million in projects that benefit the environment and 
adhere to one or more of the eligibility criteria estab-
lished by the green bonds issued by BRF. In 2021 and 
2022 alone, these investments (which were made in the 
areas of energy efficiency, renewable energy sources 
and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions) totaled 
R$ 369.11 million (or € 105.64 million, considering the

exchange rate at the time of the launch of the green 
bonds in 2015.
The HSE issues are considered in relationship to all the 
parties interested in our operations, including in the 
processes that involve the transportation of people and 
cargo, and which form a part of the HSE Management 
System for Transport and Distribution. In order to demon-
strate ongoing accountability regarding our environ-
mental impacts and results, our performance in the most 
important environmental indicators are communicated via 
the Integrated Report, results reports and regular market 
communications.

GRI 3-3: Material Topic (climate change, water and energy)  
TCFD-1.a, TCFD-1.b, TCFD-2.a, TCFD-2.b, TCFD-2.c, TCFD-3.c
 
One of the material risks for companies connected to 
food production, and one which is shared with the whole 
of humanity, is climate change. We are aware that our 
operation, our projects, our value chain and the lives 
of our stakeholders could be decisively impacted by a 
failure to contain climate change, and, as a company with 
a global presence, we have a fundamental role to play. 
As such, the Company’s Sustainability Plan elected to 
become a Net Zero company by 2040 as one of its main 
ambitions.
The Net Zero commitment includes actions to reduce 35% 
of the Scope 1 emissions (direct emissions) and Scope 
2 (emissions relating to the generation of purchased 
energy) by 2030; 12.3% of the emissions in Scope 3 
(indirect emissions in the Company's value chain); and, by 
2040, the commitment to neutralize residual emissions. 
These reduction targets were established  in comparison 
to the baselines from 2019 and 2020, respectively. 
As we move forward on this journey, BRF has adhered to 
the Science Based.  
 
Targets (SBTi) and our targets are now under review in 
light of the updates to the ‘FLAG’ methodology (Forest, 
Land and Agriculture), that were published in September 
2022. This new methodology guides companies in these 
sectors in estimating how much and how quickly they 
need to mitigate their emissions related to land use, 
according to the target of the Paris Agreement to limit 
global warming to 1.5°C.
In practice, this commitment has driven us to seek 
operational efficiency in our processes, for which we are 
prepared to deal with extreme situations and events, 
invest in technological modernization, always aiming 
for more sustainable solutions, and engage the entire 
production chain in the decarbonization of their opera-
tions, with public targets based on science, in line with 
global methodologies. This agenda is in accordance with 
the importance given to the matter by our stakeholders 
in the materiality process performed last year , whilst it 
also directly engages with the BRF Sustainability Plan and 
our monitoring indicators and metrics. We recognize the 
impact of the issue on our business, as well as the risks 
and opportunities that we can create as a result of the 
environmental footprint of the BRF operations and value 
chain.
In 2022, to assist in the process of prioritizing the initia-
tives, in partnership with the Getulio Vargas Foundation 
we developed a carbon pricing methodology, allowing us 
to collect data on the financial impact of the carbon in our 
projects and assist us in assessing the risks and opportu-
nities involved in the global scenario. By measuring this 
variable, the Company is now able to assess, compare and 
prioritize strategic investments incorporating this new 
perspective. 
Despite the uncertainties concerning the implementation 
of a regulated market in Brazil being a challenge, we 
are working to improve the pricing tool with the aim of 
developing practical knowledge and increase our ability to 
adapt to a future mandatory scenario.
Management of the BRF climate agenda is performed 
at different hierarchical levels. Since 2021, we have had 
a Net Zero Committee, which is composed of members 
of the senior management and the technical areas, with 
the aim of discussing the progress of the Net Zero plan 
and identifying opportunities that support the reduction 
of the emission of greenhouse gases in both our own 
operations and those involved in our value chain. The 
status of the Net Zero Plan is also reported to the Board 
of Directors. 
We are committed to reduce Scope 1 and 
2 emissions by 35% 
and Scope 3 emissions by
12.3% 
by 2030, this being our medium-term 
target within our commitment to Net

We are one of the 27 founders of the Brazilian GHG 
Protocol and for more than a decade now we have 
regularly published an inventory of our emissions 
of greenhouse gases in the Public Emissions Report 
Records. 
Amongst the good practices implemented, we have 
recently digitalized our greenhouse gas emissions 
inventory process, involving automated collections and 
analyses, thereby improving accuracy and facilitating the 
tracking of the information. Furthermore, as a means of 
supporting the commitment, as well as the integrity and 
transparency of our processes, we submit the Scope 1 
and Scope 2 inventories to an annual third party audit. 
Since 2009, we have been included in the B3’s Carbon 
Efficient Index (ICO2), and for more than ten years our 
ICO2 and ICDPR70
We are listed in the leading indexes 
that attest to our commitment to the 
agendas linked to carbon emissions 
and climate change
inventory has held the Gold Seal awarded by the Brazilian 
GHG Protocol Program, which certifies us at the program’s 
highest level, ensuring transparency and reliability in the 
reported data. In 2022, we were included once again in 
the Climate Resilience Index (ICDPR70), launched by CDP 
Latin America, the international organization responsible 
for gauging the environmental impact of companies and 
governments.
In 2022, we recorded a 23% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 
emissions compared to 2021, as well as a 26% reduction 
in our absolute GHG emissions in relation to the baseline 
(2019). The performance of BRF emissions was impacted 
by the reduction of the energy GRID emission factor in 
Brazil, leading to a reduction in BRF’s Scope 2 emissions in 
2022, when compared to 2019, and by the strategy imple-
mented by BRF to prioritize clean and renewable sources 
when acquiring energy.
26%
reduction of Scope 1 and 2 
absolute GHG emissions
The mapping, measurement and management of the 
emissions of the value chain (Scope 3), represents a 
challenge for any organization, and for BRF it is no 
different. We are aware of the importance of these 
emissions and have identified the chain links of priority 
importance and the main initiatives that can contribute to 
a reduction in our emissions. In 2022, we made advances 
in the mapping of more than 10 categories applicable to 
the value chain, whilst a mitigation ‘roadmap’ is currently 
under development.
As such, the sources of Scope 3 emissions measured 
by BRF currently refer to the upstream logistics, the 
external treatment of waste, and business trips. In 2022, 
we recorded a 5% increase in Scope 3 GHG emissions, 
in relation to the baseline (2020), and a 0.2% increase 
in relation to 2021, this having been influenced by the 
resumption of business trips following the slowdown 
caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as the increase 
in the amount of waste sent for external treatment in the 
form of composting.

Our commitment to increasing our use of electricity 
generated by clean sources by 50% by 2030 has been 
a priority for our investments over the last decade. This 
measure can be added to our actions concerning efficiency 
and the energy transition to renewable sources involving our 
entire operation and the chain as a whole - actions which are 
also driving our commitment to Net Zero.
Currently, 90% of the energy consumed (fuels and electricity) 
by BRF is drawn from renewable sources, 31% of the 
electricity consumed comes from clean sources (solar and 
wind), whos 24%* comes from market based sources.he

1 From 2019 to 2021, we have included the information from BRF One Pet. The 2019 and 2020 Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions were recalculated due to the incorporation of the ‘One PET’ operations and the adjustments of the Global Warming Potentials (GWP), in accordance 
with the technical note of the Brazilian GHG Protocol Program. The gases included in the calculation are carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane and hydrofluorocarbon. The other gases are not generated by BRF’s activities. The data relating to the Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions 
are audited by a third party.
2 The approach taken for consolidation is by means of operational control.
3 The company defined the year 2019 as the baseline for the reduction of emissions of Scopes 1 and 2 greenhouse gases, due to the reliability of the data and historic monitoring of the emissions, as well as having internal targets for reduction of the intensity of 
GHG emissions since then. The year 2020 was defined as the baseline for Scope 3 emissions, due to the reliability of the emissions data.

our partnerships, we are able to meet around 90% of our 
Brazilian operations’ electricity demands, thus mitigating risks 
of scarcity of supply and allowing us to operate with more 
competitive costs and achieve our target of obtaining 50% of 
our electrical energy from clean sources. 
In the value chain, 350 new solar energy generation plants 
were installed by our integrated producers. Around 1,500 of

2. The electricity sold refers to the energy sold on the free market but which was not consumed, and which has been deducted from the total 
energy consumption, meaning there is no counting of the consumption in duplicate.
The percentage of producers using solar energy gener-
ation systems accounts for approximately 15% of the 
entire number involved with BRF. The use of 100% 
clean energy means an estimated power generation 
of 19,713.75 MWh/month, equivalent to the amount 
consumed by a city of 230,000 inhabitants.
The solar panels ratified by BRF have a factory guarantee 
of 12 to 15 years and a generation guarantee of 25 years, 
whilst ratified inverters are guaranteed for between 15 
and 20 years, meaning there is less worry about having 
to change systems or perform maintenance on the 
equipment. To support its integrated producers in their 
switch to photovoltaic panels, BRF has established a 
partnership with financial institutions aimed at funding 
investments in the installation of solar panels at their 
farms.
Furthermore, visits have been made to all the production 
units in the states located in the South of Brazil and a 
series of talks have been held with integrated producers 
and extension workers. More than 500 of them learned 
about matters such as new technologies in photovoltaic 
energy systems, the changes in legislation that affect 
the renewable energy sector , the financial benefits of 
investing in a solar energy system, and the importance of 
clean energy for the sustainability of the planet.
The 100% clean generation of energy in 
the BRF’s integrated with solar panels

We work to encourage the rational and responsible use 
of natural resources, which are essential for supplying our 
agricultural and industrial operations. In relation to the 
issue of water resources, BRF is structured to comply with 
the specific requirements to the regions where it operates 
and has established a target of reducing its consumption 
in industrial operations by 13% by 2025.
The recycling and reuse of water are fundamental to this 
strategy. At the Bandirma (Turkey) and Abu Dhabi (United 
Arab Emirates) plants, around 27% of the amount of water 
consumed is already sourced from a reuse system. In the 
Brazilian operations, this percentage rose from 11% in 
2020 to 15% in 2022, and it keeps growing.
During 2022, a total of 55,682.40 ML of water was 
withdrawn for BRF’s activities. This amount, that takes into 
consideration all of the Company’s units, fell by 10.7% 
compared to 2021. Another development that has taken 
place since 2020 has been the reduction by 4.29% in the 
indicator demonstrating the amount of water consumed 
per ton produced (m³/ton) – with special mention being 
made of the international market, in which this reduction 
reached 11.17%. The main action pursued by BRF to 
ensure that it keeps moving forward has been the 
increase in the so-called capillarity of the gauging and 
management of the Water Maps at the units, meaning, in 
other words, that there has been increased measurement 
and improvement in the processes and their stages. Of 
all the water collected in 2022, 46,116.23 ML, or 83%, was 
returned only after it had been duly treated.
BRF’s investments in automation technologies for the 
measuring of water totaled R$ 18.4 over the period from 
2021 to 2022. 
Furthermore, the Company has been working towards 
better water management at all of its productive units 
through the consolidation of the Water Management 
element contained in its system, which establishes direc-
tives for the hydro eco-efficiency of BRF’s activities, thus 
standardizing the governance of water throughout all 
the units. The issue of water is, and will continue to be, 
an important agenda in our management meetings and 
those of our executive committees.
Managing water with our 
integrated producers
As our CODE OF CONDUCT FOR BRF 
BUSINESS PARTNERS makes clear , all of 
BRF’s partners need to be in compliance 
with the environmental legislation 
applicable to the areas in which they 
operate, and this includes grants for the 
use of water and their conditioning factors. 
The Company operates together with the 
integrated producers providing guidance 
and monitoring the regular standing of the 
grants on the farms.
The majority of our integrated producers 
are concentrated in the Southern region of 
Brazil as is the greatest hydro risk to BRF’s 
operations in the country. Therefore, we are 
encouraging these integrated producers to 
obtain grants for their water requirements, 
which are met principally by underground 
sources. In 2022, we recorded an increase 
of 22.05% in the number of grants awarded 
to the producers in the region, compared to 
2021.
The supply from groundwater sources 
reduced the integrated producers’ exposure 
to water shortage situations, since the water 
tables function as a stock of water for the 
activities, and are not immediately impacted 
by a lack of rain (as is the case with surface 
bodies of water).

We are constantly measuring our exposure to water 
shortage, implementing actions such as the analysis of 
the drainage basins in those regions where our indus-
trial activities are located. Furthermore, the Company 
has internally developed a hydro-vulnerability tool, that 
combines the indicators of two complementary analytical 
approaches: an internal operational view related to our 
routines and activities and an external, environmental 
view, tied to the characteristics of the drainage basins 
where each enterprise operates, and to the multiple uses 
of water in each region. 
In 2022, a total of 15,000ML of water was collected by 
the productive units located in areas with average to high 
levels of water vulnerability (the majority in the Southern 
region of the country).
All of the Company’s units have contingency plans to 
avoid significant impacts in the event of water shortage. 
In addition to this, BRF participates in water management 
discussion forums at local and regional levels, and, 
since 2020, has operated a Water Steering Committee, 
composed of representatives from senior management 
and technical areas, to improve the agility in the 
management of the hydro-resources in its operations.

Water disposal GRI 303-4
The waste produced by BRF is organic in nature. In other 
words, it is made up principally of proteins and fats as well 
as by the biodegradable detergents used in the sanitation 
process. The Company treats 100% of this waste and 
constantly monitors the quality of the rivers from which 
it collects its water and into which it releases the waste 
following treatment. As such, BRF can operate more 
proactively in the mitigation of possible environmental 
impacts and in the promotion of a harmonious interaction 
with the environment.
We also have a corporate directive that is applicable 
to our industrial and farming activities, which aims to 
standardize the indicators as well as the frequency in 
monitoring and compliance of the discharge of waste.
In 2022, BRF invested R$ 73.7 million to guarantee the 
efficiency of its water and waste treatment stations. 
Furthermore, around R$ 2 million was invested in 
the acquisition of laboratory equipment used in the 
management and control of its processes, thus ensuring 
the efficiency of its treatment stations. In 2022, BRF 
achieved 99% efficiency in its waste treatment stations, 
which was verified by external laboratories and certified 
by Inmetro. Specifically for the Biochemical Oxygen 
Demand (BOD) indicator , which measures the biode-
gradable polluting load of the waste, a removal ratio of 
99% was recorded. 
 
Neither were there any incidents related to non-com-
pliance with water-quality licenses, norms, or regulations 
during the reporting period.
Forest management GRI 304-1
We have forest assets destined for the production of 
biomass as an energy source, totaling 28,000 hectares 
distributed across 8 Brazilian states and 189 farms 
(99 are our own and 90 leased). Species belonging to 
the eucalyptus genus make up 88.33% of this area, 
while 1.23% is covered by pine an 0.34% by other tree 
genus (such as araucária, bamboo and mimosa). The 
remaining 10.1% is open area that is awaiting the next 
planting cycle.
Of our own farms, two are within a Conservation Unit 
(the Escarpa Devoniana State EPA) and 41 contain up 
to 10km of land classified as a conservation unit. The 
survey of the proximity between these farms and the 
Priority Areas for Conservation of the Biodiversity was 
undertaken in accordance with the methodology set 
forth by CONABIO Resolution nº 39 dated 12/14/2005. 
Ultimately, we obtained the results set out in the 
following table:
7 units are at a distance of up to 10 km 
from a priority area for conservation with a 
high level of biological importance;
44 units are at a distance of up to 10 km 
from a priority area for conservation with a 
very high level of biological importance;
21 units are at a distance of up to 10 
km from a priority area for conservation 
with an extremely high level of biological 
importance;
22 units are within priority areas for 
conservation with a very high level of 
biological importance;
20 units are within priority areas for 
conservation and carry an extremely high 
level of biological importance;

Waste and packaging 
GRI 306-1, 306-2, 306-3
 
The Company has an established practice of providing its 
employees with periodic training on waste management, 
and has a series of procedures for the control and 
management of its waste, amongst which are stand-
ardized tools and procedures included in the Operational 
Excellence System (OES), in the ‘More Excellence’ program, 
and in the company’s own regulatory documents, which 
cover the industrial, administrative, logistics and farming 
operations.
The Solid Waste Management Plans and the Health 
Services Plans of each unit outline the processes which 
ensure that the packaging, separation, collection, 
screening, storage, transportation and disposal of the 
waste generated are always in compliance with the 
legislation and good practices established in the internal 
programs and regulations. 
In 2022, BRF improved its management of waste data, 
established new indicators and targets (related to the 
generation, cost efficiency and disposal of waste), and is 
in the process of implementing a computerized waste 
management system to streamline the processes and 
enable online monitoring of the information which will 
thus provide support in defining the Company's strategic 
actions. These include reducing waste disposed of in 
landfills and aggregating value to byproducts that could 
serve as inputs in other internal or outsourced processes.
This management meant that, in 2022, as well as the sale 
of byproducts, more than 78% of BRF’s waste was diverted 
from final disposal and directed to composting and other 
recovery operations in licensed companies. This allowed 
these materials to be reintroduced into the production 
chain, adding new value to those materials already 
removed from nature.

compliance with the constraints of the environmental 
licensing processes. In relation to 2021, there was an 
increase of 6,835,146 tons and, of this total, around 
2,684,189 related to the generation of manure in the 
production of breeding sows, which was not accounted in 
2021.
We generally treat pig manure in anaerobic pools, 
followed by fertigation on farmlands, in line with a ferti-
lization plan guided by an expert technician. The poultry 
bedding, meanwhile, is temporarily stored allowing it 
to ferment, with a view to eliminating pathogens and 
mineralization. The material is then used as an organic 
biofertilizer in farming processes. We recommend and 
encourage our producers to use the manure as an 
organic fertilizer , as part of an agronomic project, taking 
into consideration the characteristics of the waste, soil 
and crop being grown.
We are committed to making 100% of our packaging 
recyclable, reusable and biodegradable by 2025. Through 
our R&D department, we optimize and study alternatives 
that pose no risk to the consumer’s health and safety 
in order to minimize the unnecessary generation of 
material for post-consumption disposal. Another area in 
which we have moved forward in recent years has been 
the reduction of grammage and the adoption of alter-
native materials designed to preserve the stability of the 
products.
Animal litter and manure generated   SASB FB-MP-

All of BRF’s macro-processes have the 
potential to generate waste which could, 
in turn, generate impacts. However , the 
impacts are not significantly relevant if 
we relate the hazards with amount, since 
they are controlled by procedures estab-
lished by BRF. 
 
It should be stressed that BRF controls

In Dourados (MG), in Brazil, three incidents of non-compliance 
were identified in relation to the updating of procedures, resulting 
in the cancellation of the unit’s certification. An action plan is 
being implemented to resolve the problems so that the unit can 
be recertified in May 2023. The audits for GFSI certification were 
increased in relation to 2021, with a similar increase in the incidents 
of non-compliance identified. In 2022, 301 corrective actions were 
performed and concluded, with 293 of them relating to lesser 
cases of non-compliance and 8 of them to more relevant cases of 
non-compliance.

risks contained in the Risk Management Programs which. The 
assessments of each individual take into account the history of 
exposure to agents and the results of monitoring tests. Based 
upon the results of the assessments, individual and collective 
health actions are activated. The Respiratory Protection Program 
(RPP) is a process used in the selection, use and maintenance of 
the respirators, designed to ensure proper protection to the user , 
whenever necessary in compliment to the collective protection 
measures employed, or whenever they are being implemented, in 
order to ensure that the worker is fully protected against the risks 
that exist in the work environments.

1 This indicator was calculated taking into account the average base-salaries of employees in Brazil, with this figure representing 
93% of BRF’s total number of employees globally.
2 Data from Hercosul and Mogiana were not considered.
Benefits	 GRI 401-2
The benefits offered by BRF to its full-time employees  but 
which are not offered to its temporary or part-time em-
ployees are disability or disablement support, the share 
acquisition plan and a pension plan and benefits plan.
Benefits Working hours and type of 
employment
Invalidity and disability support Full-time employees
Maternity/paternity leave Both options
Share acquisition plan Full-time employees
Health care plan Both options
Life insurance Both options
Pension plan/Benefits plan Full-time employees
1 We consider all BRF Brasil units to be relevant operating units.
Plan of retirement GRI 201-3
BRF S.A. subsidizes the plans administrated by BRF Prev-
idência. A closed, economic and non-profit supplemen-
tary pension entity, BRF Previdência has an autonomous 
private law legal personality, with a mission to adminis-
trate and execute benefit plans of a pension nature (such 
as retirements and pensions) for those employees of its 
supporters which opt to form a part of it by means of an 
agreement.
Whenever an employee chooses to join the pension plan, 
into their fund they receive a monthly payment of a BRF 
contribution equivalent to the sum of their deposit. The 
BRF Previdência benefits plans consist of equities that are 
separate from their supporter , and the results are calcu-
lated in accordance with the characteristics of each plan 
and the applicable regulations.
The participant’s basic monthly contribution corresponds 
to the result obtained from the adding together of the 
following portions: 16 I - 0.70% (zero point seven zero 
percent) of the portion of the Participating Salary lower 
than or equal to the ten (10) BRF Reference Units (URBs); 
II - 3% (three percent), in full percentages, of the portion 
of the Participating Salary that exceeds the ten (10) URBs. 
The Supporter’s normal monthly contribution should 
correspond to the result obtained from application of a 
percentage of one hundred percent (100%) of the month-
ly Basic Contribution made by the participant. In 2022, the 
percentage of participation of BRF employees in retire-
ment plans was 47.57% and the average contribution to 
the pensions was 2%. There are numerous different types 
of plans and we will not be presenting open information 
by category.

units (such as drivers, cleaning or restaurant professionals, etc.) are covered by the health and safety man-
agement systems.2 Management of the risk control is in line with the NBR 14280 norm, as well as specific corporate 
regulations, whilst the injury rate observes the methodology of the Occupational Safety & Health 
Administration (OSHA). The deaths form part of the injury rates, and the calculation of days off work 
includes consecutive days, with the count starting the day following the incident.

Intensity of greenhouse gas emissions 0.096 0.104 0.084
1 The total GHG emissions (tCO2eq) involves the sum of Scopes 1 and 2. The emissions intensity is calculated as the absolute GHG emissions (tCO2eq) in 
terms of Scopes 1 and 2 based upon 2022 production (tons). The data take into account the Global Warming Potentials (GWP), in accordance with the 
technical note of the Brazilian GHG Protocol Program. The gases included in the calculation are carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane and hydrofluo-
rocarbons. The other gases are not generated by BRF’s activities. The data relating to the Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions are audited by a third party.
