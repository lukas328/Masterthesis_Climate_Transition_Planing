Delivering for people, places and planet
Net zero 
routemap
2023
Addressing the climate crisis is now a 
fundamental responsibility for those of us in 
the built environment. We must play our part by 
providing solutions through innovative design, 
material choices – and clear action to amend 
working practices to deliver change.
The Buro Happold routemap to net zero carbon 
formalises existing processes and introduces new 
ones, demonstrating our commitment to the 
positive impact we can have on environments 
around us. It reflects our founding values, 
reconfirms the importance of our involvement in 
such critical work and demonstrates how we will 
continue to deliver for people, places and planet.
This net zero routemap lays out a framework 
that will support two of our core climate targets. 
By 2030 our goal is to design all new build 
projects to be net zero carbon in operation and 
to reduce the embodied carbon intensity of all 
new buildings, major retrofits and infrastructure 
projects by 50% from a 2020 baseline. With the 
launch of our net zero routemap, Buro Happold 
will operate within a structure that actively 
focuses on how we can meet the necessary 
requirements of net zero – and how we can 
support our clients in doing the same.
The routemap is split into three areas: advisory, 
design and operations. It demonstrates not 
only that we know where we need to go, but 
precisely how this will be achieved. We have clear 
targets to hit, and our routemap will support us in 
delivering them.
The following pages show the key areas that make 
up our net zero routemap, in detail. The routemap 
moves us further down our path to net zero. 
It is a journey that we invite all our clients and 
collaborators to join us on.
