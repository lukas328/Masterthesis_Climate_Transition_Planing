Barclays’ Climate Strategy, T argets and Progress 
20223
Dear Shareholders,
T wo years ago Barclays laid 
out a new climate approach 
in response to the climate 
crisis. We set out an ambition 
to become net zero by 2050, 
across all of our direct and 
indirect emissions, and we 
committed to align all of our 
financing activities with the 
goals and timelines of the 
Paris Agreement. We made 
it clear at the time that we 
would approach the climate 
challenge thoughtfully and 
transparently, reporting 
to shareholders and other 
stakeholders and be 
accountable for our progress.
This document sets out our climate strategy 
and targets and reports on the progress 
which	we	have	made.	It	also	sets	out	those	
areas in which the bank has continued 
to evolve its approach. Probably most 
notably, Barclays is now committing to use 
the	International	Energy	Agency’s	(IEA)	
1.5°C-aligned	scenario	as	its	baseline	for	new	
targets. We have already set 2025 targets 
for	Power	and	Energy,	but	we	are	now	adding	
2030	targets,	and	for	Cement	and	Steel	as	
well. We are also committing to phase out 
financing	of	thermal	coal.	
Chairman’s 
letter to 
shareholders
We took the decision a year ago that, at 
the 2022 Annual General Meeting, we 
would	offer	our	shareholders	a	vote	on	our	
approach to climate change in the round. 
We have had discussions with several major 
shareholders and industry bodies over many 
months	and	are	grateful	for	their	input.	It	
is not a simple task to address the climate 
challenge whilst also giving appropriate 
support to those companies which we 
believe are committed to the transition. 
We also respect legitimate concerns about 
energy security, energy poverty and the 
just transition. We hope that we have got 
the	balance	right.	The	appalling	invasion	of	
Ukraine has made it even more imperative 
to accelerate the energy transition, whilst 
imposing	real	challenges	in	achieving	uniform	
year-on-year progress. Nonetheless, our 
commitment to our climate ambition and

Introduction
Barclays’ Climate Strategy, T argets and Progress 
20224
Barclays	puts	considerable	effort	into	
both	the	expansion	of	its	green	and	
sustainable	financing	activities	and	the	
diminution	in	its	fossil	fuel	financing.	We	
also	seek	to	contribute	meaningfully	to	the	
improvement	of	policy	and	data	capture	
and measurement. These are issues owned 
by the Board and discussed at the majority 
of	Board	meetings	in	2021.	They	are	also	
owned	by	senior	management	(10%	of	
Executive	Director	remuneration	is	now	tied	
to	our	progress	in	this	field).
strategy is unchanged and by next year 
we	will	be	setting	targets	to	cover	more	of	
the	sectors	we	finance.	We	also	anticipate	
recent events will accelerate the demand 
for	investment	in	low-carbon	energy	
infrastructure	and	capacity	across	the	
world and	are	determined	to	finance,	on	an	
even greater scale, the investment needed 
for	transition.	
There is much to be done to accelerate and 
improve the transition pathways. At the top 
of	that	list	are	coherent	national	approaches	
to energy policy, and ideally a global 
approach, setting clear targets and a clear 
timeframe	for	the	decarbonisation	of	energy	
supply, almost certainly involving some 
kind	of	carbon	pricing	and	clear	incentives	
to	improve,	for	instance,	domestic	energy	
efficiency.	The IEA’s	net	zero	scenario	makes	
very	clear our	dependence	on	behavioural	
change and public policy changes to drive 
the	necessary	shift	in	the	patterns	of	both	
demand and supply.
We would also like to see greater global 
coherence around taxonomies, data and 
measurement.	We	should	not	have	different	
territorial	ways	of	measuring	a	crisis	that	
does not recognise national or regional 
boundaries. 
Shareholders and other stakeholders have 
challenged Barclays on its approach to 
the climate crisis and we have welcomed 
the engagement. We hope you agree 
that our approach is both progressive and 
responsible. We believe that our original 
championing	of	net	zero	and	Paris	alignment	
has	made	a	difference	in	banking.	We	have	
also ensured that our approach covers 
capital	markets	and	contracted	financing	
commitments as well as actual loans made. 
Clearly more needs to be done to extend this 
to the retail and consumer space, which is 
where policy leadership is so vital. 
We do hope that shareholders support 
the	work	that	we	have	done	so	far	and	
will support the Board on Resolution 26, 
recognising that, as always, there is more to 
be done.

Introduction
The drive to net zero will 
be one of the defining 
issues of our lifetime, with 
implications for each one of 
our customers and clients. 
As the person entrusted 
with the leadership of this 
company, I am completely 
committed to bringing our 
ideas, our resources, our 
energy and our passion 
to achieving the net zero 
ambition for Barclays. 
For the world to reach net zero emissions, 
three things are required. First is an 
enormous increase in low-carbon 
infrastructure	and	capacity,	including	
renewable energy networks, and technology 
to	improve	energy	efficiency,	particularly	
in transportation, building heating and 
cooling	and	food	production.	Second	is	a	
co-ordinated and material diminution in 
carbon	intensive	activity,	particularly	fossil	
fuel	consumption.	Third	is	ambitious	action	
to protect, enhance and restore natural 
ecosystems	such	as	forests	and	oceans.	
It	is	also	important	that	the	economic	
opportunities presented by an orderly 
transition are widely shared and available, 
particularly in developing countries. Realising 
a	just	and	orderly	transition	of	this	kind	will	be	
a massive and complex global undertaking. 
C.S. Venkatakrishnan 
Group	Chief	Executive,	Barclays
CEO 
introduction 
As	the	IEA	notes,	limiting	the	global	
temperature rise to 1.5°C “requires nothing 
short	of	a	total	transformation	of	the	energy	
systems	that	underpin	our	economies.”1 
More and more countries and companies 
have announced targets to limit emissions, 
but the world is not yet on track to limit global 
warming to 1.5°C.
T o achieve this ambitious goal, we must 
cooperate and coordinate globally across the  
public and private sectors. We need to establish 
common standards and transparent 
reporting, and to create the political and 
economic	conditions	for	success.
It	is	important	that	
the economic	
opportunities 
presented by an 
orderly transition are 
widely shared and 
available, particularly 
in developing	
countries.”

There	will	also	be	a	significant	need	for	 
new	investment.	It	is	estimated	that	at	
least	$3-5	trillion	of	additional	investment	
will	be	required	each	year,	for	the	next	30	
years,	in	order	to	finance	the	transition.2 As 
a	large	global	financial	intermediary,	Barclays	
has an important role in helping channel 
investment, including our own capital, into 
new green technologies and low-carbon 
infrastructure	projects.	We	also	have	a	
contribution to make in the advice, products 
and	financing	support	that	we	offer	our	
customers and clients. Above all, we must 
help	develop	common	standards	to	define	
and	measure	progress	–	financial	markets	
depend	upon them.
Barclays has been a leader among global 
investment banks in announcing its ambition 
to be net zero by 2050, with a commitment 
to	align	its	financing,	including	capital	
markets activities, to the goals and timelines 
of	the	Paris	Agreement.	To	this	end,	we	
published a comprehensive, transparent 
methodology, via BlueT rackTM, to measure 
and report our progress. However , this was 
just	the	first	step,	and	we	were	clear	that	we	
had more work to do.
T oday, we are announcing a number  
of	important	updates	to	our	approach.	
These include:	
  Setting	2030	targets,	all	of	which	integrate	
a 1.5°C-aligned scenario, to reduce our 
financed	emissions	across	four	of	the	
highest-emitting	sectors	in	our	portfolio:	
Energy, Power , Cement and Steel. We plan 
to continue this work until we have set 
targets	for	material	high-emitting	sectors	
in	our	portfolio,	which	we	aim	to	have	
completed by 2024, consistent with our 
commitments	as	a	founding	member	of	
the Net-Zero Banking Alliance.  
  Incorporating	methane	into	our	
methodology	for	measuring	greenhouse	
gas	(GHG)	emissions	for	Energy.	
  Updating our restrictive policies, in 
particular	setting	final	exit	dates	with	
respect	to	the	financing	of	thermal	coal	
mining	and	coal-fired	power	generation.
  Updating our targets to reduce our 
operational emissions.
  Aligning	the	remuneration	of	our	Executive	
Directors	with	our	climate	commitments,	
as	set	out	in	our	Directors’	Remuneration	
Report 2021.
While Barclays will continue to play a leading 
role	in	the	financial	services	industry,	we	
do not do it alone. Last year , we became a 
founding	member	of	the	Net-Zero	Banking	
Alliance	(NZBA),	part	of	the	Glasgow	
Financial	Alliance	for	Net	Zero	(GFANZ).	
We want	to	be	part	of	a	financial	system	that	
works together to accelerate the transition, 
and we will engage constructively with 
policymakers and others to address policy 
challenges.
The industrial revolution took over a century 
to	transform	the	planet,	and	we	cannot	hope	
to undo overnight its deleterious impact 
on the environment. We are still at an early 
stage	of	a	long	journey,	but	are	committed	to	
the destination and will persevere to reach it. 
One	of	my	foremost	priorities	is	for	Barclays	
to	demonstrate	steady	and	significant	
progress against our net zero ambition.

Barclays’ Climate Strategy, T argets and Progress 
20228
In March 2020, Barclays 
announced its ambition to 
be a net zero bank by 2050, 
becoming one of the first 
banks to do so. 
We have a strategy to turn 
that ambition into action.
Our climate strategy is 
informed by our Purpose:
We deploy finance 
responsibly to support 
people and businesses, 
acting with empathy and 
integrity, championing 
innovation and sustainability, 
for the common good and 
the long term.

Achieving net zero 
operations
Reducing our 
financed emissions
Financing  
the transition
Barclays is working to achieve net  
zero operations and reducing supply 
chain emissions, investing in the 
continued	decarbonisation	of	our	 
operations, and in the development  
of	a	net	zero	pathway	for	the	
emissions	from	our	supply	chain.
Barclays is committed to aligning 
its	financing	with	the	goals	and	
timelines	of	the	Paris Agreement.
Barclays is providing the green  
and	sustainable	finance	required	 
to	transform	the	economies	 
we serve.
Over the coming years, our strategy will 
continue	to	evolve.	It	will	need	to	adapt	to	
reflect	market,	technological,	regulatory	and	
geopolitical	developments	affecting	the	shape	
and	timing	of	the	transition	to	a	low-carbon	
economy. We will keep our policies, targets 
and	progress	under	review	in	light	of	the	
rapidly changing external environment and 
the need to support governments and clients 
in delivering an orderly energy transition and 
providing energy security. Progress may 
vary and we need to be able to adapt our 
approach to	optimise	the	effectiveness	and	
impact	of	our	support	for	the	transition,	
whilst	remaining	focused	on	our	ambition	of	
becoming a net zero bank by 2050.
Our strategy is underpinned by the way we assess and manage our exposure to climate-related risk.
This document sets out more detail on our 
strategy, our existing targets and progress 
to date.	We	are	also	announcing	a	number	of	
important	updates	to	our	approach,	including:

Introduction

Barclays’ Climate Strategy, T argets and Progress 
2022
All three elements of our 
strategy are important, 
but we recognise that the 
majority of our carbon 
emissions result from 
the activities of the 
clients we finance, known 
as ‘financed emissions’ . 
We believe that Barclays can make the 
greatest	difference	by	supporting	our	clients	
to transition to a low-carbon economy, 
rather	than	by	simply	phasing	out	support	for	
them.	This	is	particularly	true	for	our	clients	
in highly carbon-intensive sectors.
Exiting companies at this stage could push 
them	to	less	transparent	sources	of	funding,	
and	to	sources	that	may	be	significantly	less	
supportive	of	the	transition.	Many	highly	
carbon-intensive	sectors	require	finance	to	
transition, including Power , Energy, Cement, 
Steel, T ransport and Materials. Restricting 
the	flow	of	capital	to	these	sectors	could	be	
harmful	to	the	pace	of	the	transition,	limiting	
the real terms impact on global warming.
Our	priority	is,	therefore,	to	support	
our customers and clients to transition. 
Consistent with our Purpose, our 
climate strategy and our approach to risk 
management, and to ensure that we achieve 
our ambition to be a net zero bank by 2050, 
where companies are unable or unwilling 
to reduce or eliminate their emissions, we 
will reduce our support over time. Such 
companies	will	find	it	increasingly	difficult	to	
access	financing,	including	through	Barclays.	
Since	2020,	we	have,	for	example,	declined	
to	provide	financing	to clients	that	have	
been	unable	to	meet	our	existing policies	in	
relation to thermal coal and oil sands.
The	trajectory	for	our	clients’	transition	is	
influenced	by	a	number	of	factors,	including	
technological advancement, the public policy 
environment, behavioural change in society 
and	the	scale	of	change	needed	to	adapt	
their business models. Client transition 
pathways will vary, even within the same 
sectors and geographies. We are developing 
a	client	transition	framework	to	enable	us	to	
measure and monitor our clients’ progress 
and seek opportunities to accelerate their 
progress	through	the	provision	of	advice	and	
financing	solutions.	This	will	help	us	to	better	
understand their plans, the progress they  
are making to align with a 1.5°C pathway, as 
well	as	their	financing	needs.	The	high-level	
framework,	together	with	sector-based	
transition pathways, will allow us to more 
clearly understand how our clients’ activities 
align with Barclays’ net zero ambition and to 
identify	and	support	their	financing	needs.

We are committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions 
associated with our operations and supply chain.
Progress to date
We	have	been	carbon	neutral	for	our	
Scope 110, Scope 211 and Scope 3 
business travel12 emissions since 2020. 
We have achieved this by reducing 
or	eliminating	sources	of	carbon	
dioxide emissions associated with our 
operations and business travel and by 
compensating any remaining emissions 
by purchasing carbon credits under 
the	Verified	Carbon	Standard	(VCS).	
We have reduced our Scope 1 and 2 
emissions	by	86%	since	2018	and	we	
powered	94%	of	our	operations	with	
renewable electricity in 2021. More 
detail on our progress is set out in our 
TCFD	Report	available	online:	home.

Defining net zero operations
We	define	net	zero	operations	as	
the state in which we will achieve a 
GHG	reduction	of	our	Scope	1	and	
Scope	2	emissions	by	at	least	90%	
against a 2018 baseline and use 
carbon removals to eliminate any 
residual operational emissions we 
cannot yet abate. 
We	are	defining	carbon	neutral	as	 
first	reducing	carbon	dioxide	
emissions then counterbalancing 
carbon	dioxide	emissions	from	
Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 
business	travel	with	carbon	offsets.	
In	2020,	we	disclosed	that	we	were	
already	net	zero	from	our	own	
operations based on the common 
acceptance at that time, that net 
zero and carbon neutral were 
interchangeable	terms.	To	reflect	
the most recent interpretations 
of	both	these	terms	in	public	
disclosure, we will make a distinction 
between net zero operations and 
carbon neutral in our disclosure 
from	now	on.
10. Scope 1 emissions include our direct GHG  
emissions	from	natural	gas,	fuel	oil,	company	 
cars	and	HFC	refrigerants.
11. Scope 2 emissions include our indirect GHG  
emissions	from	purchased	electricity	and	
purchased steam and chilled water .
12. Scope 3 business travel emissions are our  
indirect	emissions	from	commercial	air	travel	 
and other transport.

Next steps and new targets
We	intend	to	remain	carbon	neutral	for	
Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 business 
travel emissions, while investing in the 
continued	decarbonisation	of	our	operations	
and	in	the	development	of	a	net	zero	
pathway	for	the	emissions	from	our	supply	
chain. We will continue to increase the 
share	of	renewable	energy	used,	improve	
the	energy	efficiency	of	our	buildings	and	
data centres, progressively remove reliance 
on	fossil	fuel,	reduce	the	level	of	waste	we	
create,	and	minimise	our	emissions	from	
business travel. 
We are announcing a new target to achieve 
a	90%	reduction	in	GHG	emissions	across	
Scopes 1 and 2 by 2025. We are also targeting 
100%	of	renewable	electricity	procured	by	the	
end	of	2025.	In	addition	to	using	green	tariff	
and	energy	attributes	certificates	to	achieve	
this target, we aim to sign Power Purchase 
Agreements and increase on-site renewable 
energy generation.
An	important	part	of	our	journey	to	achieve	
net zero will also be to address GHG 
emissions associated with the products 
and services we purchase, and to that 
end we have been working over the past 
few	years	with	our	key	suppliers	and	the	
CDP13 to engage our supply chain and drive 
climate change transparency and action. 
We	aim	by	2025	for	suppliers	covering	70%	
of	addressable	spend	to	be	disclosing	their	
GHG emissions and have science-based 
emission reduction targets in place, and we 
aim to achieve net zero emissions in our 
supply	chain	well	in	advance	of	2050.
The	following	table	summarises	our	short-	and	long-term	approach	to	achieve	
net zero operations and reduce supply chain emissions.

the VCS,	to	compensate	for	any	
remaining emissions in operations 
and business travel.
We	conduct	due	diligence	as	part	of	
our	procurement	of	carbon	offsets.	
We	have	invested	in	a	portfolio	of	
credits, under the VCS, that come 
from	approved	methodologies.	In	
addition to internal reviews, we also 
undertake	third-party	review	of	the	
project	portfolio	from	an	independent	
voluntary carbon markets advisory 
firm,	which	is	not	directly	involved	in	
the	sourcing	process.	All	final	projects	
must pass independent due diligence 
screening based on risk assessment 
in	five	key	areas	–	location,	
technology, additionality, 
environmental/social	impacts	and	
environmental/social	benefits.
We	firmly	support	initiatives	to	
enhance	the	integrity	and	quality	of	
the voluntary carbon markets 
including	the	work	of	the	Taskforce	on	
Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets.
T o achieve net zero operations we will 
look	into	procuring	credits	from	a	
range	of	high-quality	carbon	removal	
solutions.13.	CDP	(formerly	the	Carbon	Disclosure	Project)	is	a	not-

Introduction
We are committed to align 
all our financing to the goals 
and timelines of the Paris 
Agreement. In order to meet 
this ambition, we need to 
reduce the client emissions 
that we finance, not just 
for lending but for capital 
markets activities as well.
Portfolio reduction
T argets and progress to date
In	November	2020,	we	set	targets,	informed	
by Paris-aligned benchmark scenarios, 
to	reduce	our	financed	emissions.	We	
prioritised the Energy and Power sectors 
because	they	are	responsible	for	up	to	
three-quarters	of	all	Greenhouse	Gas	(GHG)	
emissions globally and because Barclays has 
meaningful	exposure	to	them.
We	set	a	target	of	30%	reduction	in	the	CO2 
intensity	of	our	Power	portfolio	by	2025,	
as	well	as	a	target	of	15%	CO2 reduction in 
absolute	emissions	of	our	Energy	portfolio	
by	2025.	Both	of	these	targets	were	set	
against	a	December	2020	baseline,	and	
both	were	aligned	with	the	IEA’s	Sustainable	
Development	Scenario	(SDS).	We	are	one	
of	only	a	small	number	of	banks	to	set	2025	
targets	for	Energy	and	Power,	and	one	of	
a	small	number	of	our	investment	banking	
peers to have set an absolute emissions 
reduction	target	for	Energy	–	effectively	
creating	a	‘carbon	budget’	for	our	Energy	
sector	financing.
We have made solid progress against our 
targets.	At	December	2021,	we	had	achieved	
an	8%	reduction	in	Power	CO2 intensity 
and	a	22%	reduction	in	absolute	financed	
emissions in Energy. 
However , it is important to note that 
progress towards our targets will likely 
be	volatile	and	non-linear.	This	reflects	a	
number	of	variables	generally	beyond	our	
control. For example, progress may be 
impacted by geopolitical developments 
that result in energy supply pressures, such 
as	the	conflict	in	Ukraine,	or	by	the	varying	
pathways that individual companies take 
as	a	result	of	the	technologies	available	to	
them	to	transition.	In	the	short	term,	we	may	
also experience decreases or increases in 
our	metrics	due	to	the	volatility	of	the	mix	
and	volume	of	capital	markets	financing,	or	
if	issuance	volumes	increase	significantly	
following	the	COVID-19	pandemic.

Introduction
We	continue	to	focus	on	understanding	our	
Power and Energy clients’ transition plans. 
There has been a notable acceleration in 
clients’ targets and climate commitments, 
particularly as they look to decarbonise their 
own	operations	(Scope	1	and	2)	with	some	
Energy clients also now including Scope 3 
emissions	in	their	climate	targets.	In	our	
Energy	portfolio,	approximately	three-quarters	
of	our	financing	is	with	Energy	producers	that	
have published decarbonisation targets; over 
half	of	our	financing	is	to	clients	that	have	
committed to becoming net zero in their 
Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions by 2050. We 
have also seen an increase in decarbonisation 
commitments	from	our	Power	clients.	As	
companies release their annual reported 
emissions	data	for	2021	in	the	coming	
months,	we	expect	to	see	further	details	and	
evidence	of their	progress	against	their	
commitments, which	will	be	reflected	in	our	
metric over time.
Next steps and new targets
As	a	founding	member	of	the	Net-Zero	
Banking	Alliance	(NZBA),	we	have	committed	
to	setting	science-based	targets	for	material	
high-emitting	sectors	in	our	portfolio	by	
2024. Our objective is to set emission 
reduction	targets	that	represent	significant	
progress towards our net zero ambition, but 
are also achievable given the expected pace 
of	the	transition	in	each	sector.
Having	already	set	2025	targets	for	Energy	
and Power , we are now setting 2030 targets 
for	both	sectors.	We	are	also	setting	2030	
targets	for	two	additional	high-emitting	
sectors:	Cement	and	Steel.
We had previously said we would set targets 
for	Metals	(Steel	and	Aluminium)	but	we	
are	now	setting	a	target	for	the	Steel	
sector	only.	This	follows	a	detailed	review	
of	our	financing	portfolios	in	each	of	these	
sectors,	that	identified	Barclays	does	not	
have material exposure to the Aluminium 
sector . Our exposure is predominantly 
through	diversified	mining	companies	where	
aluminium	production	is	a	small	element	of	
their	overall	activities	and	it	would	therefore	
be	difficult	to	set	stand-alone	aluminium	
emissions intensity reduction targets.
Scenarios – use of a 1.5°C-aligned pathway
When we set out our initial strategy in 
November 2020, we committed to evolving 
our methodology and benchmark scenarios 
as science, data and analytics expertise in 
this area advanced, updating BlueT rack™ 
over time.
We	initially	adopted	the	IEA	Sustainable	
Development	Scenario	(SDS)	to	derive	
benchmarks	and	inform	our	target	setting.	
We	chose	the	IEA	SDS	because	it	was	
developed by a reputable external provider; 
was aligned with the Paris Agreement goals; 
and, in contrast to some other scenarios, 
offered	a	sufficiently	high-resolution	dataset	
to meet our needs. We have always been 
clear	that	we	would	keep	our	use	of	the	IEA	
SDS	under	review	and,	as	other	useable	
scenarios and benchmarks developed in 
line with climate science, we will look to 
incorporate them into our approach.
Over	the	past	few	years,	and	since	we	initially	
adopted	the	IEA	SDS	scenario,	it	has	become	
increasingly clear that the world must go 
further	than	limiting	global	warming	to	less	
than 2°C above pre-industrial levels, as the 
Paris	Agreement	set	out.	The	Intergovernmental	
Panel on Climate Change, among others, has 
been clear that we must limit global warming 
to	a	maximum	of	1.5°C	in	order	to	avoid	the	
worst	consequences	of	climate	change.	The	
IEA	subsequently	introduced	an	updated	
scenario	in	May	2021,	IEA	NZE2050,	which	
achieves net zero emissions by 2050 and 
models emissions consistent with limiting 
the global	temperature	rise	to	 
1.5°C	with	a	50%	probability.
We have integrated this scenario to derive 
our benchmarks and set our 2030 targets, 
replacing	the	IEA	SDS	scenario	we	were	
previously	using.	This	also	reflects	our	
participation in the Net-Zero Banking 
Alliance	(NZBA),	which	is	part	of	the	Glasgow	
Financial	Alliance	for	Net	Zero	(GFANZ),	
and requires all signatories to use science- 
based decarbonisation scenarios that reach 
net zero by mid-century or sooner , with a 
maximum	temperature	rise	of	1.5°C	above	
pre-industrial levels by 2100.
New targets to reduce our financed emissions
In	2022,	we	are	setting	new	2030	targets	for	four	high-emitting	sectors:	Energy,	
Power , Cement and Steel.
  Energy	-40%	in	absolute	CO2e	emissions	(2020	emissions	baseline	of	
78.5 MtCO2e).	This	target	includes	an	update	in	our	methodology,	to	include	
methane emissions alongside CO2
  Power	-50%	to	-69%	in	CO2	intensity	(2020	baseline	of	320	kgCO2/MWh)
  Cement	-20%	to	-26%	in	CO2e	intensity	(2021	baseline	of	0.620	MtCO2e/Mt)
  Steel	-20%	to	-40%	in	CO2e	intensity	(2021	baseline	of	1.926	MtCO2e/Mt)
Metrics used to set our targets
We	have	used	a	carbon	emissions	intensity	metric	to	set	targets	for	Power,	
Cement and	Steel.	We	see	carbon	intensity	as	the	most	appropriate	measure	of	our	
performance, at	least	in	the	earlier	stages	of	decarbonisation,	as	it	encourages	
transition	to	lower	emitting	fuel	sources.	We	will	also	aim	to	report	the	absolute	
financed	emissions	for	each	sector	from	Full	Year	2022,	where	targets	have	been	set,	
to	provide	full	transparency.
An exception to our general measurement approach is the Energy sector , which is 
responsible	for	extracting	fossil	fuels	from	the	earth	–	mainly	coal,	oil	and	gas.	The	
Energy	sector	cannot	reduce	its	carbon	emissions	intensity	below	a	certain	point	(for	
instance,	a	barrel	of	oil	cannot	be	decarbonised).	Therefore,	a	reduction	in	absolute	
carbon	emissions	is	the	more	appropriate	measure	for	Energy.

Introduction
Incorporating methane
In	the	Energy	sector,	we	will	now	include	
methane emissions, in addition to CO2 
emissions. This will provide a more 
granular	and	accurate	measure	of	absolute	
emissions	for	Energy,	where	methane	is	a	
material gas emitted by upstream clients. 
Reducing	methane	emissions	from	this	
activity would have a measurable short-
term	effect	on	climate	change	and	is	
economically and practically easy to abate 
in many circumstances. We include all 
GHG emissions,	including	methane,	for	
Steel and	Cement.	
Methane emissions are not as directly 
material	in	the	Power	sector.	Therefore,	
we continue to measure only CO2	for	our	
Power intensity	target.
Use of target ranges
For Energy, we have set an absolute 
emissions	target,	consistent	with	IEA	
NZE2050,	which	captures	Scopes	1,	2	and 3	
of	the	emissions	of	our	clients.	In	the	near	
term, we expect absolute reductions to be 
achieved	through	a	combination	of	significant	
reductions in Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 
clients	and	some	reduction	in	the	provision	of	
finance	to	higher	emitting/higher	risk	clients.	
As	our	assessments	of	client	transition	plans	
and	risk	profiles	become	more	granular,	in	the	
absence	of	declines	in	production	levels	as	
clients switch to renewable energy sources, 
we are likely to need to reduce the number 
of	clients	we	support,	or	the	quantum	
of	financing	we	make	available	to	them,	
to	further	reduce	our	absolute	financed	
emissions, consistent with our strategy and 
management	of	risk.	Reducing	our	absolute	
financed	emissions	in	this	way	gives	us	
greater control in our ability to achieve our 
target,	so	we	have	set	a specific	or	spot	
target	for	financed	emission	reduction	in	the	
Energy sector , rather than a range.
For Power , Cement and Steel, we have 
set emissions intensity targets and, as a 
result, we are using a target range. While 
we are clear what reduction is required 
to	converge	with	the	IEA	NZE2050	
pathway,	we recognise there	are	additional	
dependencies and variables outside our 
control	that	will	determine	the	pace	of	the	
transition	and	therefore	how	quickly	we	
are	able	to	reduce	our	financed	emissions	
intensity	in	these	sectors:
  For each sector , the lower emissions 
reduction	in	the	range	reflects	an	
estimated emissions reduction trajectory 
based	on	our	current	view	of	sector	and	
client pathways and commitments;
  For each sector , the higher emissions 
reduction in the range is in line with the 
IEA	NZE2050	pathway	that	is	consistent	
with limiting global warming to 1.5°C. This 
pathway incorporates an assumption 
that	public	policy	interventions,	shifts	in	
demand and new technologies will enable 
our clients to accelerate their transition 
plans beyond current commitments or 
expectations.
T op-down portfolio assessment
Our	approach	is	to	set	granular	targets	for	
each	sector	within	our	financing	portfolio.	
However , we recognise that it will take time 
to	set	targets	for	our	entire	portfolio	using	
this approach, so we have started work to 
develop a high level, modelled assessment 
of	our	overall	balance	sheet	emissions.	
This work will progress in 2022 and is 
consistent with the approach outlined by the 
Partnership	for	Carbon	Accounting	Financials	
(PCAF),	of	which	Barclays	is	a	member.
Next sectors in our target setting
We	will	continue	to	set	targets	for	sectors	
in	our	financing	portfolio.	We	will	introduce	
targets	for	additional	sectors	in	2023	and	
2024 and have already started work to set 
targets	for	Automotive	Manufacturing	
and Residential Real Estate, which we 
will	aim	to	announce	in	time	for	the	2022	
Annual	Report.	The	phasing	of	these	
announcements	reflects	the	considerable	
work required to establish our baseline 
emissions	for	each	sector	and	to	set	
appropriate	targets,	taking	account	of	both	
our	lending	and	capital	markets	financing	
activities.
BlueT rack™
Our	approach	to	reducing	our	financed	
emissions is underpinned by BlueT rack™, 
a	methodology	we	have	developed	for	
measuring	our	financed	emissions	and	
tracking	them	at	a	portfolio	level	against	
the	goals	of	the	Paris	Agreement.	
BlueT rack™ builds on and extends 
existing industry approaches to cover 
not only lending, but also capital 
markets	financing,	setting	us	apart	from	
many	of	our	peers.	This	better	reflects	
the	breadth	of	our	support	for	clients	
through our investment bank.
BlueT rack™ starts by selecting an 
appropriate	benchmark	for	a	sector,	
which	defines	how	financed	emissions	
for	a	portfolio	need	to	change	over	time	
in	line	with	the	goals	of	the	Paris	
Agreement. We then determine how our 
sector	portfolios	are	performing	against	
these	benchmarks:	by	estimating	the	
emissions that our clients produce, 
determining how those emissions should 
be	linked	to	the	financing	we	provide,	and	
then aggregating those measurements 
into	a	portfolio-level	metric.	This	
portfolio-	level	metric	is	then	compared	
to the benchmark. This approach allows 
us to make active choices to reshape our 
portfolio	within	our	‘carbon	limit’	for	each	
sector.	This	reflects	our	focus	on	
transition	and	shows	specifically	how	 
we	are	accelerating	the	shift	from	
higher-carbon to lower-carbon activity.
For this reason, BlueT rack™ does not 
currently take into account carbon 
offsets	purchased	at	a	client	level	or	 
at	a	portfolio	level.
We	will	continue	to	enhance	and	refine	
BlueT rack™ over time, including as 
climate data quality improves and as 
company disclosures become more 
granular . We continue to engage with 
peers to share our experience and many 
welcomed	our	level	of	transparency	in	
relation to our methodology. We have 
also been pleased to hear that some 
have	used	BlueTrack™	to	inform	their	
own approach.
More details about BlueT rack™ are set 
out in our About BlueT rackTM 
whitepaper,	available	online:	home.

Introduction
Restrictive policies
In	addition	to	setting	sector-specific	
emission-reduction targets, we have set 
explicit restrictions to curtail or prohibit 
financing	of	certain	activities	and	in	sensitive	
sectors. These are summarised below 
and set out in detail in the Appendix. They 
include clear restrictions on thermal coal 
mining	and		coal-fired	power	generation,	
Arctic exploration and production, oil 
sands	and	hydraulic	fracturing	(fracking).	
Further restrictions are set out in our 
Position Statements in relation to Forestry 
and Agricultural Commodities and World 
Heritage and Ramsar Wetlands.
Thermal Coal
T oday, thermal coal is a climate risk and, 
increasingly,	the	financing	of	these	activities	
is a credit risk.
We are committed to not providing any 
project	finance	for	the	construction	or	
material	expansion	of	coal-fired	power	plants	
or	the	development	of	greenfield	thermal	
coal mines anywhere in the world. We are 
also committed to not providing general 
corporate	financing	that	is	specified	as	being	
for	new	or	expanded	coal	mining	or	coal-fired	
power plant development.
In	2020,	we	introduced	tightened	restrictions	
on	financing	of	thermal	coal	mining	and	
coal-fired	power	generation.	In	particular,	
we	set	a	limit	on	the	amount	of	revenue	
which	any	entity	may	derive	from	thermal	
coal	mining	and/or	power,	progressively	
decreasing	from 50%	since	2020	to	30%	by	
2025,	to	10%	by	2030.
Next steps and new announcements
We	are	announcing	a	tightening	of	our	
thermal	coal	policy	in	a	number	of	areas.	In	
particular,	we	are	introducing	final	phase-
out	dates	for	the	financing	of	thermal	coal	
mining	and	coal-fired	power	generation.
These vary by geography, as set out below, 
but	the	final	phase	out	date	for	financing	
clients engaged in14 thermal coal mining 
or	coal-fired	power	generation	is	2035	
(subject	to	limited	exemptions	as	set	out	in	
the	Appendix).	Consistent	with	our	intent	to	
phase	out	thermal	coal	financing,	from	2023	
we	will	not	extend	financing	to	new	clients	
engaged in thermal coal mining.
Further key changes in our thermal coal 
policy are:	
For	thermal	coal	mining:
  Bringing	forward	our	existing	plan	to	step	
down	revenue	thresholds,	so	that	from	
2023	we	will	not	provide	financing	to	existing	
clients	that	generate	more	than	30%	of	
their	revenue	from	thermal	coal	mining;
  Introducing	phase	out	dates	for	entities	
engaged	in	thermal	coal	mining	of	2030	in	
OECD	and	2035	in	the	rest	of	the	world;
  Introducing	tighter	restrictions	on	General	
Corporate	Purposes	(GCP)	financing	for	
clients engaged in opening new thermal 
coal	mines	or	material	expansion	of	
existing thermal coal mines.   
For	coal-fired	power	generation,	we	are	
also introducing phase out dates, whilst 
recognising	the	different	pace	of	power	
sector	transition	and	legislation	in	different	
areas	of	the	world:
  Introducing	phase	out	dates	for	clients	
engaged	in	coal-fired	power	generation	in	
the	UK	and	EU	by	2030,	and	in	the	rest	of	
the	world	(including	the	USA)	by	2035;
  Introducing	tighter	restrictions	on	General	
Corporate	Purposes	(GCP)	financing	for	
clients	engaged	in	the	development	of	
new	thermal	coal-fired	power	plants	or	
material expansion. 
These restrictions build upon or in some 
cases replace existing restrictions. Our 
updated position is set out in detail in our 
Climate Change Statement - our approach 
to sensitive sectors, and available to read in 
the Appendix.
Unconventional Oil & Gas
In	2020,	we	introduced	tightened	restrictions	
with	a	commitment	not	to	directly	finance	
oil and gas projects in the Arctic Circle nor to 
provide	finance	to	companies	we	consider	to	
be primarily engaged in these activities.
We	will	also	not	provide	financing	to	ancillary	
Arctic oil and gas businesses where proceeds 
are	known	to	be	for	supporting	new	oil	and	
gas exploration, production, or new pipeline 
transportation projects in the Arctic Circle. 
We	continue	to	enforce	this policy.
In	2020,	we	strengthened	our	approach	to	
the	financing	of	oil	sands.	We	will	only	provide	
financing	to	clients	who	have	projects	to	
reduce materially their overall emissions 
intensity,	and	a	plan	for	the	company	as	a	
whole to have lower emissions intensity than 
the	level	of	the	median	global	oil	producer	
by	the	end	of	the	decade.	We	continue	to	
enforce	this	policy	and	have	declined	to	
extend	or	renew	financing	to	clients	that	are	
unable to commit to such plans or projects. 
In	2021,	we	reduced	our	lending	exposure	
to	clients	in	scope	of	our	oil	sands	policy	by	
approximately	c.23%	year-on-year.
Barclays	does	not	directly	finance	projects	
involving	fracking	in	the	UK	and	Europe,	nor	
do	we	provide	any	financing	to	companies	
primarily	engaged	in	fracking	activities	in	the	
UK	and	Europe.	Any	financing	of	fracking	
outside	of	these	regions	is	subject	to	
enhanced due diligence, requiring clients and 
transactions to demonstrate consideration 
of	environmental	and	social	impacts	and	
risks.	We	continue	to	enforce	this	policy.
New announcements on 
thermal coal financing
A	summary	of	our	new	
announcements on thermal 
coal	financing	is	also	set	out	on	
page 11.
For	full	details	on	our	restrictive	
policies, please see the Appendix.

Introduction
Our approach to new investment in the Oil & Gas sector
We recognise that the transition to 
a low-carbon economy will require 
significant	decline	in	oil	and	gas	
production.	The	IEA	estimates	that	
fossil	fuels	will	need	to	decrease	from	
79%	today	to	an	estimated	22%	of	
the world’s energy supply by 2050 and, 
in	its	‘Net	Zero	Emissions	by	2050:	a	
Roadmap	for	the	Global	Energy	Sector’	
report,	it	envisages	no	further	new	
investment	in	fossil	fuel	supply	projects.	
This	is	based	on	an	assumption	of	
significant	deployment	of	clean	and	
efficient	energy	technologies,	including	
annual	additions	of	solar	PV	and	wind	
until	2030	that	are	four	times	higher	
than 2020 levels, as well as global 
energy	efficiency	improvements	
averaging	4%	a	year	to	2030,	which	
is around three times the average 
for	the	last	20	years.	If	these	levels	of	
investment are not achieved on a timely 
basis	and/or	geopolitical	issues	present	
additional challenges to near-term 
energy security, then governments may 
determine	that	new	sources	of	oil	and	
gas will continue to be required. 
We	also	recognise	that	many	of	the	
companies engaged in new oil and gas 
projects are large, multinationals that 
are	critical	for	the	transition	and	actively	
engaged	in	it,	committing	significant	
resources and expertise to renewables, 
power	infrastructure,	EV	networks	and	
other	essential	elements	of	
decarbonisation. Whilst these 
companies are not yet on a 1.5°C-aligned 
pathway, they are developing strategies 
to ensure their continued relevance in 
and contribution to a low-carbon 
economy. T ypically, these companies 
finance	their	exploration	activities	from	
cash	flows	rather	than	from	project	
finance,	so	apart	from	exiting	these	
client relationships completely, it would 
be	impracticable	for	Barclays	to	try	to	
impose	restrictions	on	financing	
specific	activities.	To	ensure	a	just	and	
orderly transition our priority is to 
continue to engage with these clients 
rather than simply exit them.
We	believe	the	financial	services	sector	
should take a considered approach to 
the	IEA’s	assessment	of	future	oil	and	
gas	requirements,	taking	a	number	of	
factors	into	account.	These	factors	
should include energy security; 
affordability;	the	ongoing	need	for	
substantial capital expenditure to provide 
the oil and gas still envisaged as being 
required	in	the	IEA	NZE	scenario;	the	
technical	challenges	of	defining	and	
monitoring reserves and production; 
and	the	ability	of	major	energy	
companies	to	finance	their	activities	
from	diverse	sources	of	capital,	including	
their balance sheets. 
Barclays will be participating in a number 
of	industry	working	groups	alongside	
peers	over	the	coming	months,	some	of	
which will look at credible and consistent 
approaches to transition pathways in sectors 
where	targets	are	being	prioritised	by	financial	
institutions, including oil and gas. This includes 
sector	working	groups	of	the	Net-Zero	
Banking	Alliance	(NZBA),	as	well	as	the	
Sectoral	Pathways	group	of	the	Glasgow	
Financial	Alliance	for	Net	Zero	(GFANZ).

Introduction
T argets and progress to date 
In	2018	we	set	a	target	to	facilitate	
£100 billion	of	financing	specifically	focused	
on green activities by 2030. Since then, we 
have facilitated	£62.2	billion	cumulative	of	
financing	for	green	activities,	reflecting	
increasing	demand	for	more	innovative	
products, such as Sustainability Linked 
Loans	and	Bonds.	In	2021,	we	facilitated	
£29.8	billion	of	green	financing,	up	69%	from	
£17.6 billion in 2020.
All	of	our	sustainable	financing	is	tracked	
using the methodology set out in the 
Barclays Sustainable Finance Framework. 
The transition to a low-
carbon economy is today’s 
defining opportunity for 
innovation and growth. There 
is a significant opportunity 
for Barclays to play a leading 
role in helping to meet 
the demand for climate 
change related financing to 
support the transition. We 
are directing investment, 
including our own capital, 
into new green technologies 
and infrastructure projects 
that will build up low-carbon 
capacity and capability.

Introduction
Investing directly in sustainability-
focused start-ups
Our	Sustainable	Impact	Capital	Programme	
has a mandate to invest up to £175 million 
of	equity	capital	in	sustainability-focused	
start-ups by 2025, helping to accelerate 
our clients’ transition towards a low-carbon 
economy.
From	the	acceleration	of	innovative	
carbon-efficient	technologies	and	supply	
chains to supporting the development 
of	viable	markets	for	carbon	capture	and	
sequestration, the Programme is seeking out 
and supporting clear , scalable propositions 
that	deliver	both	environmental	benefits	and	
economic returns.
Through	the	Programme,	we	aim	to	fill	
growth	stage	funding	gaps	to	help	accelerate	
and scale catalytic and strategic solutions to 
environmental challenges.
The	Programme	has	made	meaningful	
progress	towards	its	five	year	trajectory	
to	meet	our	target	by	building	a	portfolio	
of	strategic	investments	which	have	a	
focus	on	reducing	carbon	footprints	and	
accelerating the transition to a low-carbon 
economy:	£54 million	of	the	£175	million	
overall target has been deployed since 2020, 
with £30 million	invested	in	2021,	up	25%	
from	2020.
In	2022,	the	Programme	will	continue	
deploying	capital	to	foster	innovation	to	
support Barclays’ net zero ambition.
Next steps and new targets
Having	made	significant	progress	against	
our	target,	ahead	of	our	initial	expectations,	
we	are	reviewing	our	sustainable	financing	
strategy	and	all	green	financing	frameworks	
and	targets.	We	expect	to	provide	a	further	
update later this year , including new and 
more	granular	green	financing	targets.	
We	are	supporting	public	policy	efforts	to	
develop a robust taxonomy to standardise 
green	finance	target	setting	in	the	financial	
services sector , against which we can align 
our	green	financing	framework.	
The role of nature and biodiversity 
Nature and biodiversity are intrinsically 
connected	to	efforts	to	mitigate	
and	adapt	to	the	effects	of	climate	
change and are vital to ensuring a 
sustainable economy and healthy 
society.	The	financial	sector	will	have	
an important role to play in stewarding 
responsible	finance	and	in	supporting	
new	financial flows	for	a	nature-positive	
future.	As	a	financial	services	institution,	
Barclays has relationships with 
customers and clients across a wide 
range	of	sectors	and	geographies,	who	
face	risks	to	their	operations,	supply	
chains	and	markets	from	biodiversity	
loss and land-use change. Recognising 
the	importance	of	this	agenda,	we	are	
developing our understanding and 
evaluating the Group’s environmental 
impacts and dependencies as well 
as where we can support our clients 
through	the transition	to	a	nature-
positive economy.
Collaboration both within and across 
industries is essential to this transition. 
During	2021,	Barclays	became	a	
member	of	the	Taskforce	on	Nature-
related	Financial	Disclosures	(TNFD)	
Forum and joined the Get Nature 
Positive initiative alongside other 
businesses	to	identify	opportunities	to	
take nature-positive action. Barclays 
also contributed to the development 
of	emerging	methodologies	to	
assess nature-related impacts and 
dependencies	at	a	portfolio	level,	
including the Natural Capital Finance 
Alliance’s ENCORE biodiversity module. 
During	2022,	Barclays	will	progress	this	
work and, in particular , our engagement 
with	leading	initiatives,	with the	aim	of	
defining	a	comprehensive	and	robust	
approach	to nature	and	biodiversity	
over time.

In the	last	few	years,	Barclays	has	partnered	with	UNEP	FI	by	
engaging	in	their	TCFD	pilot	project	in	2018/19;	by	becoming	a	
founding	signatory	of	the	Principles	for	Responsible	Banking	(PRB),	
by	joining	the	Net-Zero	Banking	Alliance	(the	banking	component	
of	the	Glasgow	Financial	Alliance	for	Net	Zero	(GFANZ)).	A	Barclays	
representative	was	elected	on	behalf	of	Western	Europe	to	the	
UNEP	FI	Banking	Board.
Paris Agreement

T ransition 
Assessment
In	September	2019,	Barclays	joined	16	other	banks	in	piloting	the	
Paris	Agreement	Capital	Transition	Assessment	for	Banks	–	a	
leading	tool	developed	by	the	2˚	Investing	Initiative.	This	was	an	
important	input	in	the	development	of	BlueTrackTM.
We believe that industry 
cooperation, particularly 
in setting common 
standards and transparent 
reporting, is important for 
all our stakeholders. We 
continue to engage with 
peers, industry experts and 
academics to assess the 
transition to a low-carbon 
economy and consider 
emerging methodologies 
and taxonomies. 
T rade associations 
We endeavour to advance our climate change policy through the trade associations 
of	which	we	are	members.	Many	positions	taken	by	trade	associations	result	from	
negotiation	and	compromise	among	members	with	different	or	opposing	views.	We	
will	contribute	to	these	processes,	seeking	to	influence	how	they	evolve.	Where	a	
trade association’s position on climate change does not align with our position, we 
will challenge it and otherwise seek to make our view clear . Barclays reserves the right 
to	publicly	dissent	from	a	trade	association’s	position.	Should	a	trade	association	
adopt a material position that is irreconcilable with our values or strategy, we are 
prepared to end our membership.
We also seek to work closely with 
governments in the geographies in which 
we operate, supporting the development 
of	practical	and	ambitious	policies	
where appropriate. Barclays supports 
the	introduction	of	a	carbon	price,	to	
incentivise the	reduction	of	emissions	
across the	economy.
We have been early and active partners 
with the most consequential industry 
initiatives on climate change, which 
continue	to	define	leading	practice	and	help	
set	standards.	We	are	always	mindful	of	
ensuring our engagements are appropriate 
and consistent with relevant regulatory 
requirements.

Introduction
Governance
The Barclays PLC Board sets the strategic 
direction	and	risk	appetite	of	the	Group	and	
is	the	ultimate	decision-making	body	for	
matters	of	Group-wide	strategic,	financial,	
regulatory	or	reputational	significance.	The	
Board	is	also	responsible	for	the	oversight	of	
social and environmental matters, including 
climate-related risks and opportunities. 
During	2021,	the	Board	received	four	
updates	from	the	Group	Head	of	Public	
Policy and Corporate Responsibility and 
Group	Head	of	Sustainability,	covering	
matters including progress on our climate 
strategy, policy updates, industry trends, 
stakeholder engagement and target-setting. 
The Board also received regular updates on 
Public Policy and Corporate Responsibility 
matters	(together	with	Group	Reputation	
Risk	Reports)	from	the	Group	Head	of	 
Public Policy and Corporate Responsibility. 
These updates covered matters such as  
key government and regulatory policy, 
regulatory engagement and ESG matters 
including climate.
In	addition	to	these	Board	briefings,	the	 
Group	Head	of	Public	Policy	and	Corporate  
Responsibility regularly engaged with the 
Barclays	Group	Chief	Executive,	Chairman	
and	Non-Executive	Directors	on	a	range	 
of	matters	relating	to	the	Group’s	 
climate strategy.
The chart on page 26 summarises Barclays’ 
governance	structure	and	the	different	
responsibilities relating to climate change. 
Executive remuneration
The	Group’s	climate	strategy	is	reflected	
in	the	incentive	arrangements	for	the	
Executive	Directors	of	Barclays	PLC.	The	
annual	bonus	and	Long	Term	Incentive	Plan	
(LTIP)	outcomes	for	the	Executive	Directors	
are	based	on	a	framework	of	performance	
measures and targets, set each year by the 
Remuneration	Committee	of	the	Barclays	
PLC	Board.	A	proportion	of	the	Executive	
Directors’	bonus	and	LTIP	awards	each	
year	are	driven	by	strategic	non-financial	
measures, which in both cases include 
measures relating to climate. For the 2022 
bonus	and	2022-2024	LTIP	awards,	10%	
of	the	overall	outcome	for	each	will	be	
determined	by	performance	against	climate	
and	sustainability	measures,	reflecting	our	
ambition to be net zero by 2050, including 
our	commitment	to	align	our	financing	with

Reflecting	the	increasing	risks	associated	
with climate change, and to support Barclays’ 
ambition to be a net zero bank by 2050, in 
2020, the Board Risk Committee made the 
decision that climate risk would become 
a Principal Risk within the Enterprise Risk 
Management	Framework	(ERMF)	from	2022	
to run alongside our other Principal Risk types. 
T o support this decision, in 2021 the Barclays 
Group	delivered	a	Climate	Risk	Integration	
Plan	with	three	overarching	objectives:
  Governance	Framework:	Develop	a	
Principal Risk Framework and Risk Appetite 
Statement and integrate climate drivers 
into limit setting.
  Scenario	Analysis:	Refine	methodologies	
used	for	the	2020	scenario	analysis	to	
support	the	Bank	of	England	Biennial	
Exploratory Scenario on climate change, 
with	specific	focus	on	wholesale	credit	and	
physical risk modelling.
  Carbon	Modelling:	Enhance	the	
BlueTrack™	model	to	further	develop	the	
approach	for	the	Energy	sector,	expand	
coverage to Cement and Steel and 
consider	the	overall	net	zero	ambition	of	
the Barclays Group.
Further	information	on	our	climate-related	
governance and approach to climate risk, 
including	the	use	of	scenario	analysis,	is	set	
out	in	our	TCFD	Report.

Barclays’ Climate Strategy, T argets and Progress 
2022
We are still at an early stage  
in our journey. We recognise 
there is a huge amount of 
progress still to make, but we 
are completely committed to 
achieving our ambition. 
Over the coming years, we will aim to 
increase our momentum and continue to  
be transparent about our progress.
In	the	near	term	we	are	focused	on	making	
progress	in	a	number	of	areas	in	particular:
1. Achieving net zero operations
  Develop	a	net	zero	pathway	for	our	supply	
chain emissions.
2. Reducing our financed emissions
  Complete the review and target-setting 
for	material	high-emitting	sectors	 
by 2024, including setting targets  
for	Automotive	Manufacturing	and	
Residential	Real	Estate	in	time	for	the	 
2022 Annual Report.
  Extend	our	assessment	of	financed	
emissions	to	the	rest	of	our	financing	
activities, across all sectors, using 
BlueT rackTM.
  Continue work to reach a high-level 
assessment	of	financed	emissions	 
for	our	balance	sheet	consistent	with	 
PCAF methodology.
  Develop	a	client	transition	framework,	
using industry and sector pathways 
and best	practice	to	assess	clients’	
transition	plans	and	facilitate	
engagement and	communication	of	
our expectations.
3. Financing the transition
  Review	our	sustainable	finance	strategy,	
green	financing	frameworks	and	targets	
in 2022.
Additional work
  Continue work, with Financing a Just 
Transition	Alliance	(FJTA)	and	others,	to	
translate	the	concept	of	a	Just	Transition	
into	tangible	actions	for	the	industry.
  Progress our work to evaluate our nature-
related risks and opportunities.

Introduction
Restrictive policies
In	addition	to	setting	sector-specific	
emission-reduction targets, we have set 
explicit restrictions to curtail or prohibit 
financing1	of	certain	activities	and	in	sensitive	
sectors. These are set out in detail in our 
Climate	Change	Statement:	Our	Approach	
to Sensitive Sectors and include clear 
restrictions on thermal coal mining and coal-
fired	power	generation,	Arctic	exploration	
and production, oil sands and hydraulic 
fracturing	(fracking).	Further	restrictions	are	
set out in our Position Statements in relation 
to Forestry and Agricultural Commodities 
and World Heritage and Ramsar Wetlands.
Update on thermal coal position – 
overview
T oday, thermal coal is a climate risk and, 
increasingly,	the	financing	of	these	activities	
is a credit risk. 
We	are	therefore	tightening	our	thermal	
coal	policy	in	a	number	of	areas.	In	particular,	
we	are	introducing	final	phase	out	dates	for	
the	financing	of	thermal	coal	mining	and	
coal-fired	power	generation	(thermal	coal	
activities).	These	vary	by	geography,	as	set	
out	below,	but	the	final	phase	out	date	for	
financing	for	clients	engaged	in5 thermal 
coal	mining	or	coal-fired	power	generation	
is 2035. Consistent with our intent to phase 
out	thermal	coal	financing,	from	2023	we	will	
not	extend	financing	to	new	clients	engaged	
in5 thermal coal mining.
The key changes in our thermal coal 
policy are:	
For	thermal	coal	mining:
  Bringing	forward	our	existing	plan	to	
step down revenue thresholds, so that 
from	1 January	2023	we	will	not	extend	
financing	to	new	clients4 engaged in5 
thermal coal mining and we will not provide 
financing	to	existing	clients	that	generate	
more	than	30%	of	their	revenue	from	
thermal coal mining;
  Introducing	phase	out	dates	for	clients	
engaged in5	thermal	coal	mining	of	2030	in	
OECD	and	2035	in	the	rest	of	the	world;
  Introducing	tighter	restrictions	on	General	
Corporate	Purposes	(GCP)	financing	for	
clients engaged in opening new thermal 
coal mines2 or material expansion3	of	
existing thermal coal mines.  
For	coal-fired	power	generation,	we	are	
also introducing phase out dates, whilst 
recognising	the	different	pace	of	power	
sector	transition	and	legislation	in	different	
areas	of	the	world:
  Introducing	phase	out	dates	for	clients	
engaged in5	coal-fired	power	generation	in	
the	UK	and	EU	by	2030,	and	in	the	rest	of	
the	world	(including	the	USA)	by	2035;
  Introducing	tighter	restrictions	on	General	
Corporate	Purposes	(GCP)	financing	for	
clients engaged in5	the	development	of	
new	coal-fired	power	plants2 or material 
expansion3	of	coal-fired	power	plants.	
These restrictions build upon or in some 
cases replace existing restrictions. Our 
updated position is set out in detail below.
Thermal Coal Policy
Thermal Coal Mining:
  No	project	finance	for	greenfield	
development or material expansion3	of	
thermal coal mines anywhere in the world; 
  No	general	corporate	purpose	financing

material expansion3	of	thermal	coal	mining;
  No	financing	to	clients	that	generate	
more than	50%	of	revenue	from	thermal	
coal mining;
  By	2023,	we	will	not	provide	financing	to	
new clients4 engaged in5 thermal coal 
mining;
  By 2023, we will no longer provide 
financing to	existing	clients	that	generate	
more	than	30%	of	revenues	from	thermal	
coal mining;
  By 2023, we will not provide general 
corporate	financing	to	clients	with	entities	
engaged in opening new thermal coal 
mines2 or material expansion3	of	existing	
thermal coal mines unless an undertaking 
is	received	from	the	borrower	or	we	are	
otherwise	satisfied	that	the	proceeds	
of	the	GCP	financing	will	not	be	made	
available to entities engaged in5 opening 
new thermal coal mines or material 
expansion3	of	existing	thermal	coal	mines;
  By	2030,	we	will	phase	out	financing	to	all	
clients engaged in5 thermal coal mining 
(OECD)	and	for	the	rest	of	the	world	no	
longer	provide	financing	to	clients	that	
generate	more	than	10%	of	revenue	from	
thermal coal mining;
  By	2035,	we	will	phase	out	financing	for	all	
clients engaged in5 thermal coal mining.
Restrictions	relating	to	%	revenue	generated	
by	clients	from	thermal	coal	mining	apply	
to	the	entity	being	financed,	whether	
transacting with a group parent, subsidiary or 
joint venture.
Coal-Fired Power:
  No	project	finance	to	enable	the	
construction or material expansion3	of	
coal-fired	power	stations	anywhere	in	
the world;
  No	general	corporate	purposes	(GCP)	
financing	that	is	specified	as	being	for	
coal-fired	power	plant	development	or	
material expansion3; 
  No	financing	to	clients	that	generate	
more	than	50%	of	revenue	from	coal-fired	
power generation;
  By 2023, we will not provide general 
corporate	financing	to	clients	with	entities	
engaged in5	developing	new	coal-fired	
power plants2 or material expansion5	of	
existing	coal-fired	power	plants	unless	an	
undertaking	is	received	from	the	borrower	or	
we	are	otherwise	satisfied	that	proceeds	of	
such	GCP	financing	will	not	be	made	available	
to entities engaged in5 developing new coal-
fired	power	plants	or	material	expansion5 
of existing	coal-fired	power	plants;
  By 2025, we will no longer provide 
financing to	clients	that	generate	more	
than	30%	of	revenue	from	coal-fired	
power generation;
  By	2030,	we	will	phase	out	financing	to	
all clients engaged in5	coal-fired	power	
generation	(UK	and	EU)	and	for	the	rest	
of	the	world	(including	USA)	no	longer	
provide	financing	to	clients	that	generate	
more	than	10%	of	revenue	from	coal-fired	
power generation;
  By	2035	we	will	phase	out	financing	for	
all clients engaged in5	thermal	coal-fired	
power generation.
Restrictions	relating	to	%	revenue	generated	
by	clients	from	thermal	coal-fired	power	
generation listed above apply to the entity 
being	financed,	whether	transacting	with	a	
group parent, subsidiary or joint venture.

Introduction
General	exceptions	apply	in	the	following	
circumstances:
  Where Barclays is providing transition 
finance	for	companies	reducing	their	
thermal	coal	portfolio	including	retrofitting	
of	existing	facilities;
  Where	Barclays	is	providing	finance	for	
decommissioning	plants	for	those	unable	
to transition.
In	addition	exceptions	to	the	phase	out	
date(s)	for	coal-fired	power	plants	apply	if:
  Remaining	coal-fired	power	plants	are	
abated to reduce GHG emissions to near 
zero OR
  Remaining	coal-fired	power	plants	solely	
utilised as back-up to low carbon power 
supply OR
  Remaining	coal-fired	power	plants	are	
required	to	remain	open	by	operation	of	
law, regulation or contract.
Mountain T op Removal Coal Mining
Mountain	Top	Removal	(MTR)	coal	mining	
refers	to	surface	coal	mining	(and	the	
associated	reclamation	operations)	that	
remove entire coal seams running through 
the	upper	fraction	of	a	mountain,	ridge,	or	
hill,	by	removing	all	of	the	overburden	and	
creating a level plateau or gently rolling 
contour with no high walls remaining7.
The	following	additional	restrictions	are	in	
place	for	clients	active	in	MTR:
  Barclays does not directly6	finance	MTR	
projects or developments;
  We	apply	Enhanced	Due	Diligence	(EDD)	
to	financing	facilities	involving	clients	which	
practise MTR.
Arctic Oil and Gas
Arctic	Oil	and	Gas	refers	to	new	exploration	
and	extraction	of	oil	and	gas	in	the	area	
within the Arctic Circle which is subject to sea 
ice,	and	includes	the	Arctic	National	Wildlife	
Refuge	(ANWR)	and	the	Coastal	Plains8. The 
ANWR	is	a	particularly	fragile	and	pristine	
ecosystem which is central to the livelihoods 
and	culture	of	local	indigenous	peoples.	We	
have	therefore	introduced	the	following	
restrictions:
  We	will	not	directly	finance6 oil and gas 
projects in the Arctic Circle, including but 
not limited to the ANWR;
  In	addition,	we	will	not	provide	any	
financing	to	companies	primarily	engaged	
in oil and gas exploration and production 
operations in the Arctic Circle, including 
but not limited to the ANWR;
  We	will	also	not	provide	financing	to	
ancillary Arctic oil and gas businesses 
where	proceeds	are	known	to	be	for	
supporting new oil and gas exploration, 
production or new pipeline transportation 
projects in the Arctic Circle.
Hydraulic fracturing
Hydraulic	fracturing,	commonly	referred	to	
as	fracking,	is	an	oil	and	gas	well	development	
technique,	using	a	high	pressure	injection	of	
liquid	into	the	rock,	which	creates	fracturing	
and	allows	natural	gas	and	oil	to	flow	more	
freely.	Whilst	this	method	of	extraction	has	
provided	cheaper,	more	plentiful	energy	
sources	for	many,	it	is	also	a	sensitive	sector	
that	is	of	concern	for	many	stakeholders.	
Impact	areas	include	water	consumption	and	
quality, wastewater disposal, air emissions 
and impacts on local communities, including 
noise,	traffic	and	seismic	changes.	Our	
appetite	for	doing	business	with	this	industry	
is	as	follows:
  We	will	not	directly	finance6 projects 
involving	fracking	in	the	UK	and	Europe;
  In	addition,	we	will	not	provide	any	
financing1 to companies primarily engaged 
in	fracking	activities	in	the	UK	and	Europe;
  Any	financing1	for	a	company	involved	
in	fracking	activities	outside	the	UK	and	
Europe,	is	subject	to	EDD.
Fracking clients and transactions which 
are	subject	to	EDD	must	demonstrate	
consideration	of	environmental	and	
social impacts and risks and, in addition, 
demonstrate	the	following:
  Compliance with legal, regulatory and 
permitting requirements and remediation 
plans	resulting	from	any	breaches;
  GHG emissions management and 
continuous reduction;
  Management	of	key	environmental	
impacts,	including:	well	construction	and	
maintenance, water use and conservation, 
wastewater management, water pollution 
management, air emissions management 
(including	flaring);
  Engagement with local communities on 
impacts, including seismic impacts, noise, 
health	and	safety.
Oil sands
Oil	sands	refers	to	naturally	occurring	
deposits	of	water	and	clay,	containing	
a heavy, viscous oil called bitumen. The 
development	of	Canada’s	oil	sands	reserves	
is Canadian government policy and, as such, 
the Canadian Oil Sands industry is highly 
regulated. 
We	will	only	provide	financing	to	clients	who	
have projects to reduce materially their 
overall	emissions	intensity,	and	a	plan	for	the	
company as a whole to have lower emissions 
intensity	than	the	level	of	the	median	global	
oil	producer	by	the	end	of	the	decade.	
In	addition	to	this	requirement,	any	financing	
for	a	company	involved	in	the	exploration,	
extraction,	transportation	(including	the	
construction	of	pipelines	to	carry	oil	sands),	
or	processing	of	oil	sands,	is	subject	to	EDD.
Oil sands clients and transactions which 
are	subject	to	EDD	must	demonstrate	
consideration	of	environmental	and	
social impacts and risks and, in addition, 
demonstrate	the	following:
  Compliance with all legal, regulatory and 
permitting requirements in the regions 
that	they	operate,	showing	evidence	of	any	
breaches being adequately remediated;
  Management and implementation 
of	procedures	which	minimise	direct	
environmental impacts including land 
reclamation, air , ground and water 
pollution,	freshwater	use,	biodiversity	
protection, and impacts on protected 
areas	such	as	boreal	forests.

Introduction
Enhanced Due Diligence
We	conduct	Enhanced	Due	Diligence	(EDD)	
on a case-by-case basis on clients in these 
sensitive	energy	sectors	that	fall	outside	
explicit restrictions, and will consider the 
following	factors	as	a	minimum:
i. The client’s adherence to the Equator 
Principles	(if	a	project	finance	or	
credit transaction is deemed to be 
in	scope)	and	relevant	International	
Finance	Corporation	(IFC)	performance	
standards;
ii. The client’s adherence to local and 
national environmental regulation and 
standards and industry best practice;
iii. The client’s management and 
implementation	of	procedures	which	
minimise direct environmental impacts in 
the	context	of	their	operations;
iv. The client’s transparent corporate 
governance	and	oversight	of	climate	
change issues and associated corporate 
risks, including disclosure against 
principles such as the Financial Stability 
Board	(FSB)	Taskforce	on	Climate-related	
Financial	Disclosures	and	appropriate	
transition plans;
v. The client’s approach to and track record 
in	protecting	the	health	and	safety	of	the	
workforce	and	local	communities;
vi. The client’s approach to stakeholder 
engagement and consultation, including 
its commitment and adherence to the 
principles	of	Free	Prior	Informed	Consent	
(FPIC)	where	indigenous	peoples	may	be	
impacted by their operations;
vii. The client’s approach to managing its 
human rights impacts, including its 
commitment and adherence to UN 
Voluntary Principles on Security and 
Human Rights where the client uses 
security personnel.
In	order	to	assist	and	enhance	the	EDD	
process, we operate a mandatory training 
programme which has been rolled out to 
relevant colleagues.
External technical input may be obtained 
to assist the business in reviewing and 
assessing whether certain client activities 
meet	our	internal	EDD	criteria,	or	where	
there is uncertainty as to whether a certain 
activity	is	within	scope	of	our	EDD	criteria.	
Barclays will continue to align its approach to 
sensitive energy sectors with developments 
in government and public policy.
Key Definitions:
1. Financing	refers	to	all	lending,	underwriting,	issuance	of	debt	and	equity,	trade	and	working	capital	finance.
2. New thermal coal assets	i.e.	development	of	new	thermal	coal	mines	or	development	or	commissioning	of	new	coal-fired	
power plants. 
3. Material expansion:	For	coal	mining	–	increase	in	annual	tonnage	of	thermal	coal	extracted	from	existing	thermal	coal	
mines	by	more	than	20%	measured	from	a	baseline	of	maximum	p.a.	tonnage	for	preceding	three	years;	for	thermal	
coal	power	production	–	investment	to	extend	the	unabated	operating	lifetime	of	existing	thermal	coal	power	plants	or	
increase	net	operational	thermal	power	capacity	by	more	than	20%	measure	from	a	baseline	of	maximum	capacity	for	
preceding three years reported.
	 Expansion	in	such	cases	relates	to	absolute	global	increases	rather	than	increases	for	an	entity	or	group	as	a	result	of	
mergers or acquisitions.
4. New Client	means	no	member	of	the	group	was	a	client	of	Barclays	as	at	1	April	2022.
5.	 An	entity	is	“engaged	in”	if	it	generates	more	than	5%	of	its	revenues	from	the	activity.	
6. Directly	finance	refers	to	project	finance	or	other	lending/underwriting	where	the	use	of	proceeds	is	known	to	be	for	a	
particular project.
7. The	Surface	Mining	Control	&	Reclamation	Act	(SMCRA	1977),	available	at	www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2012-title30-
vol3/pdf/CFR-2012-title30-vol3-sec716-3.pdf.

In preparing this document we have:
(i)	 made	a	number	of	key	judgements,	
estimations and assumptions, and 
the processes and issues involved are 
complex.	This	is	for	example	the	case	in	
relation	to	financed	emissions,	sector	
targets,	classification	of	environmental	
financing,	operational	emissions	and	
measurement	of	climate	risk;	
(ii)	 used	ESG	and	climate	data,	models	
and methodologies that we consider 
to	be	appropriate	and	suitable	for	
these purposes as at the date on which 
they were deployed. However , these 
data, models and methodologies are 
not	of	the	same	standard	as	those	
available	in	the	context	of	other	financial	
information,	nor	subject	to	the	same	
or equivalent disclosure standards, 
historical	reference	points,	benchmarks	
or globally accepted accounting 
principles. There is an inability to rely 
on historical data as a strong indicator 
of	future	trajectories,	in	the	case	of	
climate change and its evolution. 
Outputs	of	models,	processed	data	and	
methodologies	will	also	be	affected	by	
underlying data quality which can be 
hard to assess.
(iii)	 Understanding	of	approaches	to	climate	
transition is rapidly evolving. Approaches 
and	information	contained	in	this	
document may be subject to change 
without	notice.	Some	of	the	content	
of	this	document	(such	as	targets,	
restrictions,	definitions,	assessments,	
and	estimations)	is	forward-looking,	
and developed based on our current 
information	and	belief,	and	is	subject	
to	future	risks,	dependencies	and	
uncertainties and may change over time. 
Actual	outcomes	may	differ	from	those	
set out in the document and Barclays 
does not undertake to update any
