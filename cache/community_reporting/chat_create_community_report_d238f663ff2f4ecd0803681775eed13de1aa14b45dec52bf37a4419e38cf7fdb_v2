These entities play a crucial role in funding and supporting climate transition efforts by developing and implementing comprehensive net-zero transition plans. Such plans typically include setting emissions reduction targets, strategies for decarbonization, the use of carbon credits, and managing climate-related risks. Financial institutions actively assess and disclose climate-related risks, provide guidance, recommendations, and case studies to support clients' emissions reduction efforts, and establish policies and metrics aligned with climate goals. They engage with stakeholders, including clients and portfolio companies, to promote climate-related objectives, exercise shareholder rights to influence corporate climate strategies, and support the phasedown of high-emission assets. These organizations are committed to aligning their portfolios with net-zero targets, supporting climate solutions, and exercising responsible governance, risk management, and remuneration strategies related to climate objectives.
