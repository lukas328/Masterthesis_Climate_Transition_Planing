It produces comprehensive reports that inform global climate policies and targets, serving as a critical resource for policymakers worldwide. The IPCC develops and provides climate scenarios, such as RCP 8.5, RCP 2.6, and the 1.5°C pathway, which are used for scenario analysis, risk assessments, and evaluating physical risks associated with climate change. Additionally, the IPCC creates climate models and frameworks, including the Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs), to support understanding of future climate impacts. Its assessments and scenario development play a vital role in guiding science-based target setting for sectors and organizations, such as the NZBA, and in informing global efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change.\",5\n108,NZBA,\"Net Zero Banking Alliance, an international initiative that Mizuho participates in to align banking practices with net zero goals\",8\n419,SCENARIOS,\"The entity \"\"SCENARIOS\"\" encompasses various climate models and projections used to evaluate and plan for the impacts of climate change.
