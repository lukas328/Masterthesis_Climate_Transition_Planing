Barclays has targeted the cement industry for emissions reduction as part of its broader efforts to address climate change. Similarly, BBVA has incorporated the cement sector into its climate goals, setting targets to reduce emission intensity by 20% to 26% by 2022, based on 2021 baseline data. The cement industry is also identified as a high transition risk sector, prompting efforts to improve risk management and engagement strategies within the industry. Overall, the cement sector is under significant scrutiny and targeted for substantial emissions reductions, reflecting its critical role in global efforts to mitigate climate change.\",14\n121,STEEL,\"The steel industry is a highly carbon-intensive manufacturing sector involved in the production of steel, a subsector within metals and mining. It is characterized by significant greenhouse gas emissions, particularly CO2 and methane, which are included in various emissions reporting frameworks such as Barclays' scope of emissions measurement. The industry contributes substantially to industrial emissions and is affected by environmental regulations and market shifts related to the low-carbon transition. \n\nAs a sector targeted for transition support, the steel industry faces increased costs associated with decarbonization efforts, including investments in cleaner technologies and efforts to reduce emission intensity against baseline levels established in 2021. These efforts are part of broader climate targets and reduction strategies aimed at lowering greenhouse gas emissions. \n\nThe industry is also subject to physical climate risks and transition risks, with evaluations conducted by financial institutions such as BBVA and Mizuho. BBVA's transition scorecard assesses the steel sector's low-carbon profile and decarbonization objectives, highlighting its high transition risk due to the need for significant changes in production processes and energy consumption. Mizuho's policies for engagement and risk management emphasize the importance of supporting the sector through the low-carbon transition, recognizing its role in manufacturing and its vulnerability to policy and market changes.\n\nOverall, the steel industry is a critical focus for climate-related financial and environmental strategies, with ongoing efforts to reduce emissions, manage transition risks, and adapt to evolving regulatory and market conditions driven by climate change mitigation policies.\",13\n177,2050,\"By the year 2050, Mizuho aims to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across its entire finance portfolio. Similarly, BBVA has set 2050 as its target year to become emission-neutral, attaining net-zero emissions in its banking operations and asset management activities. Additionally, the report envisions 2050 as the milestone for achieving overall net-zero emissions and ending investments in fossil fuel supply projects. Collectively, these entities and the report emphasize 2050 as the global target date for significant reductions in carbon emissions and a transition away from fossil fuel investments.\",2\n370,EMISSIONS INTENSITY,\"\"\"Emissions intensity\"\" is a measure of environmental impact used across various industries, including oil sands projects, cement, and steel production. It quantifies the amount of CO2 emissions produced per unit of output—such as per ton of cement or steel—serving as an indicator of progress toward decarbonization and sustainability goals. Policies in these sectors often mandate reductions in emissions intensity over time to minimize environmental impact and promote cleaner production practices.\",1\n134,CARBON-RELATED SECTORS,\"Sectors such as electric utilities, oil, gas, coal, steel, and cement are high-risk areas for transition risks associated with climate change\",9\n118,OIL,\"Oil refers to petroleum resources that are extracted for use as energy and fuel. The oil sector is involved in fossil fuel extraction and energy production, and it is significantly impacted by climate policies and transition risks. Additionally, the extraction and use of oil pose environmental and social risks, which are considered in financing decisions related to this sector.\",1\n119,GAS,\"GAS refers to natural gas resources, including shale gas, which require assessments prior to extraction projects. The sector involved in natural gas is part of the fossil fuel energy industry and is subject to both physical risks, such as those arising from climate change impacts, and transition risks resulting from evolving climate policies aimed at reducing carbon emissions.\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n494,CEMENT,CO2,\"CO2 emissions are produced during cement manufacturing, with emissions intensity metrics discussed\",21\n218,STEEL,CLIMATE POLICIES,\"Decarbonization policies impact the steel sector, increasing costs and influencing emissions\",17\n495,CEMENT,2050,Target year for achieving significant decarbonization in the cement industry,16\n496,CEMENT,EMISSIONS INTENSITY,Cement's emissions intensity is a key metric for assessing environmental impact,15\n236,CARBON-RELATED SECTORS,ELECTRIC UTILITIES,\"Electric utilities are a key sector facing high transition risks, especially those reliant on coal-fired power\",13\n237,CARBON-RELATED SECTORS,OIL,Oil sector is identified as a high transition risk area due to its carbon emissions and energy production methods,10\n238,CARBON-RELATED SECTORS,GAS,Gas sector is part of the high-risk sectors evaluated for transition risks and engagement strategies,10\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
