These entities play a crucial role in funding and supporting climate transition efforts by developing and implementing comprehensive net-zero transition plans. Such plans typically include setting emissions reduction targets, strategies for decarbonization, the use of carbon credits, and managing climate-related risks. Financial institutions actively assess and disclose climate-related risks, provide guidance, recommendations, and case studies to support clients' emissions reduction efforts, and establish policies and metrics aligned with climate goals. They engage with stakeholders, including clients and portfolio companies, to promote climate-related objectives, exercise shareholder rights to influence corporate climate strategies, and support the phasedown of high-emission assets. These organizations are committed to aligning their portfolios with net-zero targets, supporting climate solutions, and exercising responsible governance, risk management, and remuneration strategies related to climate objectives. Many financial institutions aim to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 or sooner, working towards sustainable finance and integrating climate considerations into their operations and strategic planning.\",31\n1648,REAL-ECONOMY COMPANIES,\"Real-economy companies are businesses involved in physical production and services that are targeted for transition support, financial shifting, and the development of new financial products to facilitate their move toward achieving net-zero emissions. These companies are characterized by their operational emissions and actively collaborate with financial institutions to develop and finance strategies aimed at reducing their carbon footprint and promoting sustainable practices.\",1\n1654,ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY,\"The \"\"ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY\"\" is a component of the financial institution's overall plan that delineates how it will interact with external stakeholders, including clients, industry peers, government entities, and the public sector. This strategic approach is designed to support the net-zero transition by proactively providing feedback, support, and escalation frameworks to clients and portfolio companies, thereby promoting climate-aligned transition strategies. Specifically, SEB's engagement strategy emphasizes active collaboration with industry peers, policymakers, and stakeholders to facilitate and advance efforts toward achieving net-zero objectives.\",10\n1643,ALIGNED,\"A status of companies or entities that are already aligned with a 1.5°C pathway, often supported by targets, plans, and performance reports\",1\n1757,WORLD BENCHMARKING ALLIANCE,An organization that provides benchmarks and assessments for companies' climate metrics and transition plans,1\n1758,BANKING ENVIRONMENT INITIATIVE,A collaborative initiative that promotes sustainable banking practices and climate-related assessments,1\n1759,UIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE INSTITUTE FOR SUSTAINABILITY LEADERSHIP,An academic organization providing guidance and research on sustainable finance and climate risk assessment,1\n1802,GARP,\"Global Association of Risk Professionals, an organization outlining risk management frameworks and climate governance practices for financial institutions.\nGlobal Association of Risk Professionals, an organization outlining risk management and climate governance frameworks for financial institutions.\",1\n1605,POLICIES AND CONDITIONS,\"\"\"POLICIES AND CONDITIONS\"\" refer to the rules and standards established by the institution to manage business activities in high-emission sectors.

It includes guidelines for establishing measurable interim and long-term emissions reduction targets, defining specific timelines, and identifying performance indicators to monitor progress toward net-zero objectives. Mizuho Financial Group, in particular, has established detailed quantitative metrics and targets to track its environmental and social risk mitigation efforts. These include sector-specific standards and criteria for engagement in industries such as power generation, coal mining, and oil and gas. Mizuho's transition plan features annual reviews of client transition risk responses and sets clear, measurable goals for emissions reduction and sustainability performance. The company's ESG Data Book provides detailed information on its specific metrics, targets, and recent results, reflecting a structured approach to monitoring and achieving its climate-related commitments.
