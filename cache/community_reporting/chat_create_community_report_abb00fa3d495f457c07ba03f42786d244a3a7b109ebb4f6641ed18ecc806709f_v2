These risks include extreme weather events such as floods, heatwaves, and sea-level rise, which can threaten the operations, assets, and clients of organizations like Citi and ORBIA. Physical risks are associated with the direct impacts of climate change on properties, health services, and infrastructure, and are identified through climate risk analyses conducted by these entities.\",3\n519,CLIMATE RISK,\"Climate risk refers to the potential financial and operational impacts of climate change on entities such as Citi and Orbia. For Citi, climate risk is a key focus area within its risk management framework, with dedicated teams and evolving governance structures established since 2021 to monitor, assess, and integrate climate-related factors into their risk processes. This includes understanding both physical risks—such as damage from extreme weather events—and transition risks associated with the shift to a low-carbon economy. Regulators and financial institutions actively monitor and regulate these risks to ensure financial stability. Similarly, Orbia identifies and manages climate risks through its governance and strategic planning processes, recognizing the potential impacts of climate change on its financial statements. These impacts are assessed through management inquiries, internal reporting, and external publications, emphasizing the importance of integrating climate considerations into overall risk management and strategic decision-making.\",16\n1181,PRINCIPAL RISKS,\"Major risks identified by NatWest Group that are significantly affected by climate change, including credit, operational, reputational, conduct, and regulatory risks\nMajor risks identified by NatWest Group impacted by climate change, including credit, operational, reputational, conduct, and regulatory risks\",2\n1837,CLIMATE RISK ASSESSMENT & SCORECARD,\"A tool developed by Citi to evaluate and quantify the climate risk profiles of its corporate clients, aiding in risk management and decision-making.\",2\n1180,CLIMATE-RELATED RISK SCORECARDS,Tools developed by NatWest Group to qualitatively and quantitatively assess climate risk exposure across sectors and portfolios,1\n1004,PHYSICAL RISKS,event,1\n1005,TRANSITION RISKS,event,1\n1836,CITIBANK NA,\"Citi's primary banking subsidiary, engaged in retail, corporate, and investment banking activities, with a focus on integrating climate risk considerations into its risk management framework.\",1\n478,SCENARIO ANALYSIS,\"A method used to assess potential future impacts of climate change on the company, discussed on page 48\",10\n1770,CITIGROUP,ORGANIZATION,4\n1192,TRANSITION RISK,\"Transition risk involves financial losses due to policy changes, technological shifts, and market adjustments as economies move toward net-zero emissions, affecting borrower creditworthiness and asset values\",1\n1875,WWW.CITIGROUP.COM,\"The official website of Citigroup, where additional disclosures and reports related to Citi’s environmental and regulatory compliance can be found\",1\n1740,INVEST,\"Invest refers to the act of allocating resources, typically capital, into companies or projects, with an emphasis on integrating ESG factors and responsible practices\",3\n2081,TARGETS AND METRICS,\"The company has set science-based decarbonization targets, baseline emissions, and portfolio temperature scores, and is measuring progress through various climate metrics\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n269,PHYSICAL RISK,CLIMATE CHANGE,Climate change causes physical risks such as floods and heatwaves that impact Bupa's operations,22\n1381,CLIMATE RISK,PRINCIPAL RISKS,\"Climate change impacts several principal risks including credit, operational, and reputational risks\",18\n2218,CLIMATE RISK,CLIMATE RISK ASSESSMENT & SCORECARD,The CRAS tool is used to evaluate climate risk profiles of clients,18\n1378,CLIMATE RISK,CLIMATE-RELATED RISK SCORECARDS,Scorecards are tools developed by NatWest Group to evaluate climate risk exposure,17\n1379,CLIMATE RISK,PHYSICAL RISKS,Physical risks are a component of climate risk arising from climate change effects,17\n1380,CLIMATE RISK,TRANSITION RISKS,Transition risks are a component of climate risk arising from economic and policy shifts,17\n2217,CITIBANK NA,CLIMATE RISK,Citi's banking subsidiary incorporates climate risk considerations into its operations,17\n1382,SCENARIO ANALYSIS,PRINCIPAL RISKS,Scenario analysis is used to evaluate climate risk impacts on principal risks,12\n2215,CITIGROUP,TCFD,Citi aligns with the TCFD's framework to enhance climate-related disclosures and risk management,12\n1399,SCENARIO ANALYSIS,TRANSITION RISK,\"Transition risk is a component of climate scenario analysis, focusing on policy and market shifts\",11\n2300,CITIGROUP,WWW.CITIGROUP.COM,Citigroup’s official website provides additional disclosures and reports,5\n2635,INVEST,TARGETS AND METRICS,Invest activities involve setting and baselining emissions targets and metrics,4\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
