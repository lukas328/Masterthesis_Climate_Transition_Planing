Additionally, different future pathways—namely Orderly transition, Abrupt transition, Hot house world, Too little, too late—are employed by Itaú Unibanco to model potential climate impacts and inform strategic planning. These pathways represent diverse transition scenarios, including rapid, pragmatic, and slow transitions, and are used to evaluate potential climate impacts comprehensively. Specific scenarios like the IEA Net-Zero pathway are also utilized by Itaú to guide decarbonization targets and strategic decision-making.
