Its primary goal is to limit global temperature rise to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, with an aspirational target to limit the increase to 1.5°C. The agreement serves as a guiding framework for countries, corporations, and financial institutions to develop strategies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting sustainable practices. Various financial institutions and companies, including Mizuho, Barclays, BBVA, and Diageo, support and align their climate strategies with the Paris Agreement's objectives. Mizuho incorporates the treaty's goals into its climate strategies, while Barclays supported the agreement by participating in the Capital Transition Assessment pilot in 2019. BBVA's ESG advisory services assist clients in supporting and complying with the treaty's aims, and Diageo fully endorses the agreement to help limit global temperature rise.
