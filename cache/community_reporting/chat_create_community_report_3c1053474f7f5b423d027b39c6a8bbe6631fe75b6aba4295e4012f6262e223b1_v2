It is the target year for achieving net zero emissions across all financed emissions, as outlined in the organization's climate pathways and transition plans. Additionally, 2050 serves as a key milestone in climate scenario analysis, representing the target year for cumulative impact assessments related to climate goals and strategies.\",5\n1028,2030,\"The year 2030 serves as a pivotal target year for multiple organizations and initiatives in their efforts to combat climate change and achieve sustainability goals. Specifically, Phoenix Group aims to reduce the carbon intensity of all assets under its control by at least 50%, covering approximately £250 billion in assets under administration (AUA), and to further decrease its temperature score to 2.2°C, expanding coverage to all assets it controls and influences. The group has set 2030 as an intermediate milestone for emissions reduction and pathway alignment within its Net Zero Transition Plan.\n\nSimilarly, Citi has designated 2030 as a key target year to eliminate its remaining exposure to thermal coal mining companies and to achieve climate alignment across its steel portfolio. It also aims to meet its financed emissions reduction goals and overall climate strategy by this year. NatWest Group plans to reach significant reductions in emissions and attain net zero across its financed emissions and operations by 2030. Additionally, the bank targets a 70% portfolio alignment to net-zero and a 50% reduction in carbon intensity.\n\nOther sectors and organizations have set 2030 as a milestone for specific emissions reduction targets: Allianz aims for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions and other climate-related objectives by this year. In the transportation and energy sectors, 2030 is viewed as the year by which electric vehicles are expected to become the dominant new vehicle type, and electricity generation is projected to be predominantly renewable. Furthermore, supply chain efforts include a goal to reduce supply chain carbon intensity by 50% from a 2019 baseline.\n\nOverall, 2030 is recognized as a critical deadline for achieving substantial progress in emissions reductions, decarbonization milestones, and broader climate and energy transition objectives across financial institutions, insurance companies, and energy sectors.\",7\n733,2025,\"The year 2025 serves as a significant milestone for various financial institutions and organizations in their climate and decarbonization strategies. Phoenix Group has set an interim goal to reduce the carbon intensity of all assets under its control and influence by 25% by 2025, covering approximately £160 billion in assets under administration (AUA). This target is part of its broader climate strategy to decarbonize investment portfolios and operational emissions. Similarly, Allianz considers 2025 a key milestone for its emissions reduction targets and vendor commitments, indicating progress toward its climate objectives. \n\nCiti aims to have reduced its credit exposure to thermal coal mining companies by 50% by 2025 and to have developed climate-aligned steel portfolio metrics, reflecting its commitment to aligning its portfolio with climate goals. NatWest Group targets sourcing 100% renewable electricity and reducing its operational emissions by 50% from 2019 levels by 2025, demonstrating its focus on operational decarbonization. Additionally, NatWest plans for 25% of its highest-emitting suppliers to have Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)-based targets aligned with its net zero roadmap by this year.\n\nFurthermore, efforts to reduce the climate impact of assets include a target to lower the temperature score from 2.8°C to 2.6°C, covering assets such as listed equities and credit. Prudential has set a goal to establish a 2030 decarbonization target aligned with NZAOA requirements, with 2025 serving as a preparatory milestone for this longer-term objective.
