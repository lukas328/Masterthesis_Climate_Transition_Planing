These emissions typically result from activities such as fuel combustion in vehicles, natural gas use, and fugitive emissions. Several of these entities have set targets for reducing their Scope 1 emissions; for example, LSEG aims for a 50% reduction by 2030, BRF targets a 35% reduction by 2030, and Phoenix Group plans to achieve a reduction by 2025. Additionally, Scope 1 emissions encompass direct energy consumption from real estate operations and corporate aviation, measured in metric tons of CO2 equivalent. Overall, Scope 1 emissions represent the direct environmental impact of these organizations' owned or controlled sources, with ongoing efforts to reduce their carbon footprint.\",10\n173,SCOPE 2,\"Scope 2 refers to the category of indirect greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the generation of purchased electricity, steam, heating, and cooling consumed by various entities, including Wincanton, Phoenix Group, Bupa, BRF, and NatWest Group. These emissions are associated with grid electricity consumption and reflect the indirect impact of energy purchased by these organizations. Several entities have set targets to reduce their Scope 2 emissions; for example, Phoenix Group aims to achieve a 50% reduction in indirect emissions from purchased electricity, heat, or steam by 2030 and a 35% reduction in indirect energy emissions by 2030, with a specific goal to reduce these emissions by 2025. The shift from location-based to market-based emissions accounting is also noted, emphasizing efforts to more accurately measure and manage these indirect emissions.
