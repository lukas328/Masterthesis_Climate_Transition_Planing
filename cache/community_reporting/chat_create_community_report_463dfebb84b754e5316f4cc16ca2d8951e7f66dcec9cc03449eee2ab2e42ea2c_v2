Specifically, it involves practices such as recycling and reusing materials like epoxy resin from wind turbine blades, thereby promoting sustainable resource management. Vestas, a leading organization in this domain, advocates for a circular economy by implementing strategies to reduce waste, increase material efficiency, and develop sustainable recycling pathways for wind turbine components. Their principles include minimizing waste, maximizing reuse and recycling, supporting sustainable manufacturing practices, and working towards zero waste goals. These efforts aim to reduce reliance on single-use items, reuse assets, and foster environmentally responsible practices within the wind energy industry.\",3\n908,ENERGY EFFICIENCY,\"The entity \"\"ENERGY EFFICIENCY\"\" encompasses a range of actions and initiatives aimed at optimizing energy use across various operations and assets. These efforts include implementing plans to reduce overall energy consumption, such as relocating to more energy-efficient buildings and adopting technologies designed to lower energy use. Organizations like Phoenix Group have undertaken measures to enhance energy efficiency within their operations, including initiatives to improve residential energy performance through mortgage incentives and retrofit programs. Additionally, efforts focus on reducing energy consumption in buildings and systems to decrease emissions, with specific measures such as improving warehouse energy use through LED lighting and waste reduction projects, exemplified by Wincanton. The assessment of energy efficiency also involves rating buildings from A (best) to G (worst), which is used to evaluate residential mortgage portfolios and support climate-related ambitions. Overall, these combined actions reflect a comprehensive approach to improving energy use, reducing operational emissions, and supporting sustainability goals.\",6\n1216,UK RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE PORTFOLIO,\"The collection of residential mortgages in the UK held by NatWest Group, with energy efficiency ratings and targets for improvement\",2\n1217,EPC RATING,\"Energy Performance Certificate rating indicating the energy efficiency of a property, with targets for C or above by 2030\",1\n948,EPC A AND B,ORGANIZATION,1\n1332,SUSTAINABLE FINANCE,Financial practices supporting sustainable development,4\n1844,CLEAN TECHNOLOGY,\"A category of sustainable finance activities supporting renewable energy and environmentally friendly technologies, contributing 0.6 billion in 2020\",1\n1402,END-OF-LIFE TURBINE BLADES,\"Blades reaching the end of their operational life, targeted for recycling and circularity solutions by Vestas\",1\n1218,ENERGY EFFICIENCY TARGET,NatWest Group's goal to have 50% of its UK mortgage portfolio rated C or above by 2030,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n1646,VESTAS,CIRCULAR ECONOMY,Vestas aims to promote a circular economy through blade recycling and material reuse,225\n1425,ENERGY EFFICIENCY,UK RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE PORTFOLIO,\"The portfolio's energy efficiency is assessed via EPC ratings, with targets for improvement\",8\n1426,ENERGY EFFICIENCY,EPC RATING,EPC ratings determine the energy efficiency of properties in the mortgage portfolio,7\n1427,ENERGY EFFICIENCY,EPC A AND B,Targeted high-efficiency ratings for properties to meet climate and funding goals,7\n2232,SUSTAINABLE FINANCE,CIRCULAR ECONOMY,Circular economy activities contributed to Citi's sustainable finance goals in 2020,7\n2233,SUSTAINABLE FINANCE,CLEAN TECHNOLOGY,Clean technology investments contributed to Citi's sustainable finance goals in 2020,5\n1683,END-OF-LIFE TURBINE BLADES,CIRCULAR ECONOMY,End-of-life blades are central to Vestas' circularity efforts to achieve zero-waste turbines,4\n1428,UK RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE PORTFOLIO,ENERGY EFFICIENCY TARGET,The goal to increase the proportion of properties rated C or above by 2030,3\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
