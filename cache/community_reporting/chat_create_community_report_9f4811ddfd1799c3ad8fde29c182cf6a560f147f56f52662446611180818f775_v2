It poses significant physical risks, such as flooding and rising temperatures, which threaten ecosystems, economies, and the stability of financial and operational systems worldwide. Additionally, climate change presents transition risks related to policy shifts, market changes, and technological advancements aimed at reducing carbon emissions.\n\nVarious organizations and financial institutions actively address this challenge through comprehensive strategies. Mizuho, for example, has implemented revised policies targeting transition risk sectors, including coal-fired power generation and thermal coal mining, to support a low-carbon society and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. It integrates climate risk management into its strategic planning, risk assessments, and client support, emphasizing resilience initiatives and sustainable finance. Similarly, BBVA incorporates decarbonization, risk management, and transition planning into its operations, recognizing climate change as a top risk impacting financial stability, society, and the environment. BBVA mobilized 81% of its total funds in 2022 toward environmental and climate-related activities, reflecting its commitment to addressing the issue through sustainable finance and decarbonization efforts.\n\nOther entities, such as Diageo and Johnson Matthey, focus on mitigating climate change through emission reduction targets, sustainability initiatives, and innovative environmental solutions. Diageo addresses climate change by implementing data-led strategies and sustainability initiatives aimed at reducing emissions and supporting resilience. Johnson Matthey integrates environmental innovations into its operations and supply chain resilience strategies to mitigate risks associated with climate change.\n\nAsset managers like AM-One and financial institutions like Groupe BPCE and Natixis emphasize technological innovation, investment, and the development of climate risk assessment tools to facilitate decarbonization and sustainable finance. These efforts are driven by the recognition that climate change impacts financial markets, asset valuation, and operational risks, necessitating large-scale investments and strategic adaptation.\n\nOverall, climate change influences global policies, corporate strategies, and financial risk management, prompting organizations worldwide to develop net-zero strategies, adopt renewable energy initiatives, and implement decarbonization targets. It remains a central focus for the financial sector, governments, and corporations aiming to mitigate physical and transition risks, protect ecosystems, and ensure long-term economic stability.\",37\n264,CLIMATE-RELATED RISKS,\"Climate-related risks are potential financial risks associated with the impacts of climate change, which organizations such as the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) help to disclose and manage. These risks include both physical risks—such as extreme weather events and environmental changes—and transition risks—such as policy shifts, technological advancements, and market changes—that can influence client strategies and impact companies and financial institutions.
