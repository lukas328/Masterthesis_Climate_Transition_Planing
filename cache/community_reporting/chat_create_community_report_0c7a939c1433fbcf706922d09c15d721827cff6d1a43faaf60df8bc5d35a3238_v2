The industry contributes substantially to industrial emissions and is affected by environmental regulations and market shifts related to the low-carbon transition. \n\nAs a sector targeted for transition support, the steel industry faces increased costs associated with decarbonization efforts, including investments in cleaner technologies and efforts to reduce emission intensity against baseline levels established in 2021. These efforts are part of broader climate targets and reduction strategies aimed at lowering greenhouse gas emissions. \n\nThe industry is also subject to physical climate risks and transition risks, with evaluations conducted by financial institutions such as BBVA and Mizuho. BBVA's transition scorecard assesses the steel sector's low-carbon profile and decarbonization objectives, highlighting its high transition risk due to the need for significant changes in production processes and energy consumption. Mizuho's policies for engagement and risk management emphasize the importance of supporting the sector through the low-carbon transition, recognizing its role in manufacturing and its vulnerability to policy and market changes.\n\nOverall, the steel industry is a critical focus for climate-related financial and environmental strategies, with ongoing efforts to reduce emissions, manage transition risks, and adapt to evolving regulatory and market conditions driven by climate change mitigation policies.\",13\n370,EMISSIONS INTENSITY,\"\"\"Emissions intensity\"\" is a measure of environmental impact used across various industries, including oil sands projects, cement, and steel production. It quantifies the amount of CO2 emissions produced per unit of output—such as per ton of cement or steel—serving as an indicator of progress toward decarbonization and sustainability goals. Policies in these sectors often mandate reductions in emissions intensity over time to minimize environmental impact and promote cleaner production practices.\",1\n325,ARCTIC CIRCLE,\"Region known for oil and gas extraction projects, which are subject to environmental and social risk assessments when financed\",1\n22,GHG EMISSIONS,\"Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions refer to the pollutants, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane, released into the atmosphere from various human activities, including industrial operations, transportation, and supply chains. Multiple organizations, including Diageo, Mizuho, and Johnson Matthey, are actively engaged in measuring, disclosing, and reducing these emissions. Diageo focuses on emissions from its operations and supply chain across Scope 1, 2, and 3, with the goal of significantly reducing these emissions to achieve net-zero targets. Similarly, Johnson Matthey reports its total GHG emissions, encompassing Scope 1, 2, and 3, and is committed to reducing these emissions by 2030 as part of its sustainability strategy. Mizuho aims to measure its GHG emissions, incorporate them into risk management and target-setting processes, and reduce emissions across its activities.
