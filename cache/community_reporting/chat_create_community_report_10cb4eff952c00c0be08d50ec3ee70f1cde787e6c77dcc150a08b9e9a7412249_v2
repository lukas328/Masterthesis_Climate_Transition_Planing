Multiple organizations, including Diageo, Mizuho, and Johnson Matthey, are actively engaged in measuring, disclosing, and reducing these emissions. Diageo focuses on emissions from its operations and supply chain across Scope 1, 2, and 3, with the goal of significantly reducing these emissions to achieve net-zero targets. Similarly, Johnson Matthey reports its total GHG emissions, encompassing Scope 1, 2, and 3, and is committed to reducing these emissions by 2030 as part of its sustainability strategy. Mizuho aims to measure its GHG emissions, incorporate them into risk management and target-setting processes, and reduce emissions across its activities. Overall, these organizations recognize the importance of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate climate change and are implementing strategies to achieve net-zero emissions through technological advancements and comprehensive emission management.\",5\n415,METRICS,\"The entity \"\"METRICS\"\" refers to a set of quantitative measures employed by various organizations to monitor and evaluate progress toward climate and sustainability targets. Specifically, Johnson Matthey utilizes these metrics to track advancements related to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the recycled content of platinum group metals (PGMs). BBVA applies similar quantitative measures to assess progress in decarbonization and overall sustainability objectives. Additionally, these metrics are used broadly to monitor efforts toward climate-related goals, including emissions reductions, portfolio alignment with sustainability standards, and transition activities aimed at achieving net-zero emissions.
