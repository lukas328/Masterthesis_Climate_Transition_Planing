These emissions typically result from activities such as fuel combustion in vehicles, natural gas use, and fugitive emissions. Several of these entities have set targets for reducing their Scope 1 emissions; for example, LSEG aims for a 50% reduction by 2030, BRF targets a 35% reduction by 2030, and Phoenix Group plans to achieve a reduction by 2025.

Several entities have set targets to reduce their Scope 2 emissions; for example, Phoenix Group aims to achieve a 50% reduction in indirect emissions from purchased electricity, heat, or steam by 2030 and a 35% reduction in indirect energy emissions by 2030, with a specific goal to reduce these emissions by 2025. The shift from location-based to market-based emissions accounting is also noted, emphasizing efforts to more accurately measure and manage these indirect emissions.
