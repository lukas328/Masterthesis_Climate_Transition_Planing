It is used by financial institutions such as Mizuho and BBVA to analyze transition risks and assess the implications of moving towards a low-carbon economy. The scenario assumes the implementation of strict policies and measures to reach net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050, with the primary goal of limiting global temperature rise and reducing climate-related risks. BBVA has set a specific target within this framework to achieve neutrality in its own emissions as well as in the emissions it finances by 2050, marking a significant milestone in its sustainability strategy. Overall, NET ZERO 2050 represents a critical benchmark for global efforts to combat climate change through ambitious policy action and corporate commitments.\",4\n114,BELOW 2°C,\"\"\"BELOW 2°C\"\" is a climate scenario representing efforts to limit global temperature rise to below 2°C. It is used for climate risk assessment and assumes that global temperature increase remains under this threshold, serving as a benchmark for evaluating potential impacts and guiding mitigation strategies.\",4\n115,DELAYED TRANSITION,\"\"\"Delayed Transition\"\" refers to a scenario in which the shift to a low-carbon economy is postponed, resulting in increased credit costs and heightened risk assessments. This scenario assumes a gradual increase in policy stringency, with climate action efforts being delayed, thereby impacting financial and economic stability related to climate change mitigation.\",4\n116,CURRENT POLICIES,\"\"\"Current policies\"\" refer to the existing climate and environmental policies that are in place without any additional climate action. This scenario assumes that only these existing policies are maintained, serving as a baseline for impact and climate risk analysis. Under current policies, if no further measures are taken, the continuation of these policies would lead to ongoing temperature increases and an escalation in climate-related damages.\",3\n242,SCENARIO,\"The entity \"\"SCENARIO\"\" refers to various modeled future states and pathways used to analyze and plan for climate change. These include different climate scenarios such as Net Zero 2050, Below 2°C, Delayed Transition, and Current Policies, which are employed to assess future risks and opportunities associated with climate change. A scenario can also be a defined pathway or model, like the Net Zero Scenario, used to set targets and guide decarbonization strategies. It represents a plausible, coherent, and internally consistent description of possible future climate change outcomes, serving to inform planning and strategy for climate mitigation and adaptation. Climate scenarios are utilized to model pathways for achieving net-zero emissions, with examples from organizations such as the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS). Additionally, the term encompasses modeled future states—such as rapid transition, pragmatic evolution, or slow transition—that are used to evaluate impacts and develop appropriate strategies for addressing climate change.\",4\n246,NGFS SCENARIOS,The Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) provides climate-related scenario analysis for financial stability and policy planning,4\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n67,SCENARIO NETWORK,MIZUHO,Mizuho uses the NGFS Scenario Network to analyze climate risks,63\n63,NET ZERO 2050,SCENARIO NETWORK,Net Zero 2050 is a scenario used within the NGFS framework for climate risk analysis,9\n64,BELOW 2°C,SCENARIO NETWORK,Below 2°C is a scenario used within the NGFS framework for climate risk analysis,9\n65,DELAYED TRANSITION,SCENARIO NETWORK,Delayed Transition is a scenario used within the NGFS framework for climate risk analysis,9\n66,CURRENT POLICIES,SCENARIO NETWORK,Current Policies scenario is used for baseline impact analysis,8\n201,NET ZERO 2050,SCENARIO,A scenario used to evaluate transition risks associated with achieving net-zero emissions by 2050,8\n205,NGFS SCENARIOS,BELOW 2°C,\"The NGFS provides the below 2°C scenario, which assumes strict climate policies and technological progress\",8\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
