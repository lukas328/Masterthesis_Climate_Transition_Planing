For instance, Citi included 2021 in its emissions review and inventory update, using it as a benchmark for assessing financed emissions, setting 2030 reduction targets, and reporting progress toward sustainability goals. Citi also observed improvements in data quality scores for financed emissions in the energy and power sectors during this year.\n\nAdditionally, 2021 was used as a comparative period for financial data, liabilities, bond issues, claims provisions, insurance assets and liabilities, pension scheme data, and derivative and deferred taxation figures across various entities such as Bupa, NatWest Group, and others.

It was also the year when the Group acquired Vitamedica and Civil Service Healthcare Society, and when the organization onboarded primary providers of climate data and models.\n\nIn terms of governance and reporting, 2021 saw the first external audit engagement by PwC, the most recent GRI report disclosure, and updated emissions estimates and scenario analyses.
