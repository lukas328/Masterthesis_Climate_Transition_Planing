As of March 2023, over 370 institutions worldwide are members of PCAF. The organization provides comprehensive formulas, standards, and guidelines for calculating financed emissions, which are widely adopted and referenced by financial institutions such as Mizuho. PCAF's standards are recognized for ensuring data quality and consistency in carbon accounting within the financial industry. Mizuho has been supported by PCAF in its efforts to measure and manage its carbon footprint related to financial activities, utilizing PCAF's methodologies and standards. Additionally, PCAF's work is endorsed by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), making it a recommended framework for financial institutions aiming to accurately assess and disclose their financed emissions.\",3\n13,CDP,\"CDP, formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project, is a non-profit organization that operates a global disclosure system for companies and cities to manage and report their environmental impacts, including climate change and water security.

The organization collaborates with various companies, such as Itaú Unibanco and Diageo, to enhance transparency and progress in environmental and climate-related efforts.
