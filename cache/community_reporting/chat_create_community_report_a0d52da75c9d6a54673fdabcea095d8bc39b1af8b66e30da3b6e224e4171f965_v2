They encompass investments targeted for emissions reduction, transition strategies, and the inclusion of climate solutions, with the aim of promoting decarbonization and achieving net-zero alignment by specific target years, such as 2030. For example, BBVA's investment portfolio includes European and Mexican assets, with a focus on sectors with high climate risk and financed emissions, and is aligned with decarbonization and sustainability objectives. Similarly, Allianz's holdings across various asset classes are targeted for emission reductions by 2030.
