These scenarios include NGFS reference scenarios, RCP pathways, and internal models employed by organizations like Citi to project future climate impacts based on assumptions about policies, technological developments, and socio-economic factors. They are designed to explore plausible future climate and economic outcomes, not to serve as precise forecasts. The scenarios encompass different plausible future pathways, including those related to decarbonization efforts, and are used to evaluate the potential effects of various policy and technological developments. Additionally, these scenarios are utilized in analyses such as PAA eligibility assessments to evaluate possible future situations, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding potential climate-related risks and impacts under diverse assumptions.\",4\n1310,IPCC,\"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is an international scientific body that provides comprehensive assessments and projections related to climate change.
