They are designed to help financial institutions identify, assess, and manage environmental and social risks associated with their project finance activities. The Equator Principles are adhered to by various financial institutions, including BBVA and Itaú Unibanco, which implement these standards to ensure responsible financing practices. BBVA, for example, applies the Equator Principles to projects affecting indigenous communities, while Itaú Unibanco focuses on managing climate change-related impacts based on International Finance Corporation (IFC) standards.
