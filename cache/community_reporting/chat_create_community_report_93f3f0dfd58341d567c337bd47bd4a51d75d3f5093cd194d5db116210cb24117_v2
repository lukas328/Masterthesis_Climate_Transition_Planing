It serves as a comprehensive global framework for greenhouse gas accounting and reporting, providing guidance on measuring, managing, and verifying emissions across various organizations and sectors. The GHG Protocol is widely adopted by numerous companies and organizations worldwide, including LSEG, Bupa, Vodafone UK, and BRF, to ensure consistent and accurate emissions accounting. It covers all scopes of emissions—Scope 1 (direct emissions), Scope 2 (indirect emissions from purchased electricity), and Scope 3 (other indirect emissions)—and offers methodologies for calculating physical and economic emission intensities. The protocol also includes specific programs, such as BRF's Brazilian emissions reporting initiative, and is used by organizations to develop their carbon reporting strategies, verify emissions data, and meet regulatory or voluntary reporting requirements.\",4\n189,BGUK,\"BGUK is the UK-based division of the Group, implementing decarbonization initiatives, energy optimization, and renewable energy projects in the UK\nBGUK is the UK operations division of the company, responsible for implementing decarbonization initiatives and energy management activities\",5\n48,UNITED KINGDOM,The United Kingdom is a geographical entity representing the location of Bupa's headquarters and serves as its primary regulatory environment.,11\n188,LONDON,\"London is the capital city of the United Kingdom, serving as a central hub for various activities and institutions.
