Citi's supply chain emissions include significant categories such as purchased goods and services, capital goods, and transportation, which are critical for overall greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting. LSEG manages its network of suppliers and partners by actively monitoring and reducing their emissions, with a target to set science-based emission reduction targets for 67% of its suppliers by 2026. Similarly, NatWest Group assesses and manages climate-related risks within its supplier network. Vestas engages its suppliers and contractors to contribute to scope 3 emissions reduction, waste reduction, circularity commitments, and overall environmental footprint minimization. Phoenix Group's supply chain involves key third-party suppliers whose emissions are being monitored and targeted for reduction, with a specific goal to decrease carbon intensity by 50% by 2030 through decarbonization efforts, data improvements, and increased engagement. Across these organizations, supply chain metrics are developed to measure impacts and progress in reducing environmental impacts, supporting decarbonization efforts, and achieving sustainability targets. The supply chain activities are overseen by dedicated teams, such as the ESG Supply Chain team, to ensure effective monitoring, management, and reduction of emissions, waste, and environmental impact throughout the network of suppliers and partners involved in their operations.\",5\n1731,REPRISK,RepRisk is a data provider that offers news and data used to support ESG research and risk monitoring.
