These risks include the material impacts of climate-related physical events on BBVA's operations and asset quality. BBVA considers physical risks arising from extreme weather events and environmental changes as part of its comprehensive risk assessment processes, including its Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP). The bank actively analyzes and incorporates these physical climate change impacts into its scenario planning to better understand and manage potential vulnerabilities.\",4\n111,TRANSITION RISK,\"Transition risk refers to the financial and operational risks associated with the shift towards a low-carbon economy. These risks encompass a range of factors including policy changes, technological advancements, and market dynamics that can impact industries, assets, and loan portfolios. BBVA assesses transition risk as part of its climate risk management strategy, utilizing tools such as the Transition Risk Indicator (TRi) and metrics like High Transition Risk and High Market Misalignment to evaluate potential financial impacts. Overall, transition risk involves the potential for financial losses resulting from regulatory shifts, technological developments, and evolving market conditions driven by the global transition to a more sustainable, low-carbon economy.\",5\n460,CLIMATE CHANGE RISK,Climate change risk encompasses physical risks (like extreme meteorological events) and transition risks (such as policy and technological changes) that may impact financial portfolios and operational stability,4\n127,RISK MANAGEMENT,\"The entity \"\"RISK MANAGEMENT\"\" encompasses a comprehensive set of frameworks and processes implemented by various financial and industrial organizations to identify, assess, and mitigate climate-related and other operational risks. BBVA has established a framework for managing climate-related risks, including setting decarbonization targets for sectors such as oil and gas, power, steel, cement, autos, and coal. Barclays incorporates climate-related risks into its overall risk management framework, employing processes to identify, assess, and mitigate these risks alongside other types of risks. Mizuho has developed a detailed risk management framework that involves verifying client compliance, engaging with clients annually, and responding to violations to mitigate environmental and social risks in its financing activities. This framework also includes assessing environmental and social risks in client engagements, particularly in transition risk sectors, and is part of Mizuho's broader strategy to identify, quantify, and manage climate-related regulatory and transition risks. Mizuho's processes are designed to identify, assess, and mitigate both financial and environmental risks across its operations and credit portfolios, ensuring comprehensive risk oversight. Similarly, Johnson Matthey integrates risk management into its governance and strategic planning by identifying, assessing, and mitigating strategic, operational, and compliance risks, including those related to non-compliance, fraud, and operational hazards. Overall, these organizations employ structured frameworks and policies to monitor, evaluate, and address climate-related and other risks, ensuring proactive risk mitigation within their respective operational and financial activities.\",4\n481,MEASUREMENT AND INTEGRATION OF TRANSITION RISK,\"A process described in the report where BBVA assesses risks related to the transition to a low-carbon economy, including methodologies and data quality scores\nA process described in the report for assessing and managing transition risks associated with climate change, including methodologies and data quality scores\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n222,MIZUHO FINANCIAL GROUP,PHYSICAL RISK,Mizuho assesses physical risks to its assets and operations due to climate change,63\n2050,TRANSITION RISK,TRANSITION PLANNING,Organizations develop plans to mitigate transition risks associated with moving to a low-carbon economy,11\n440,CLIMATE CHANGE RISK,TRANSITION RISK,\"Transition risk is a component of climate change risk, involving economic and policy shifts affecting industries and portfolios\",9\n452,CLIMATE CHANGE RISK,RISK MANAGEMENT,Climate change risks are being incorporated into risk management processes and policies,8\n462,MEASUREMENT AND INTEGRATION OF TRANSITION RISK,TRANSITION RISK,\"The process involves assessing risks related to climate transition, using methodologies like PCAF\",6\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
