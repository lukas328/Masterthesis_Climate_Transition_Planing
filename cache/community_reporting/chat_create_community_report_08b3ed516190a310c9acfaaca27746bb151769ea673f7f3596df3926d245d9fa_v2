In 2021, numerous organizations undertook substantial efforts related to emissions reduction, process optimization, and enhancing climate resilience. For instance, Citi included 2021 in its emissions review and inventory update, using it as a benchmark for assessing financed emissions, setting 2030 reduction targets, and reporting progress toward sustainability goals. Citi also observed improvements in data quality scores for financed emissions in the energy and power sectors during this year.\n\nAdditionally, 2021 was used as a comparative period for financial data, liabilities, bond issues, claims provisions, insurance assets and liabilities, pension scheme data, and derivative and deferred taxation figures across various entities such as Bupa, NatWest Group, and others. It served as a reference point for remuneration changes, financial reporting, and demographic statistics, as well as for the implementation of accounting standards like IFRS guidance on Demand Deposits with Restrictions on Use.\n\nIn the realm of sustainability and ESG initiatives, 2021 marked the establishment of the Sustainable Markets Initiative and the achievement of progress in supplier commitments, with 17% of suppliers by emissions having science-based targets in place. It was also the year when Bupa completed a materiality assessment to identify key ESG issues, and NATWEST GROUP conducted scenario analyses to evaluate climate risk impacts on principal risks. NatWest Group reported its emissions data and progress during this year, including achieving the SKA Silver accreditation for sustainable hubs and establishing baseline data for future updates.\n\nFurthermore, 2021 was the year when organizations like Phoenix Group reduced emissions by approximately 15% from 2019 levels, began calculating the carbon footprint of their investment portfolios, and increased emissions measurement coverage. It was also the year when the Group acquired Vitamedica and Civil Service Healthcare Society, and when the organization onboarded primary providers of climate data and models.\n\nIn terms of governance and reporting, 2021 saw the first external audit engagement by PwC, the most recent GRI report disclosure, and updated emissions estimates and scenario analyses. It was also the year when Prudential established its Board Responsibility & Sustainability Working Group, committed to achieving net zero by 2050, and when NatWest Group first achieved the SKA Silver accreditation.\n\nOverall, 2021 served as a pivotal year for data collection, reporting, strategic planning, and progress in sustainability, emissions reduction, and financial stability across multiple organizations\",17\n659,ACTUARY,\"An individual employed by the Group to perform the valuation of the pension scheme as of 31 December 2022, using IAS 19 standards\",2\n47,2022,\"The entity \"\"2022\"\" is associated with an event, indicating that it was a significant occurrence or series of occurrences during that year.
