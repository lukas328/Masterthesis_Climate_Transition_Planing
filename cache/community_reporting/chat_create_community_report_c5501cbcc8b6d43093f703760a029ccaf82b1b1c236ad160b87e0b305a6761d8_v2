It is recognized as a major health crisis and the biggest health threat facing humanity, according to the World Health Organization. This phenomenon influences a wide range of sectors and organizations, impacting financial and operational risks, weather patterns, health, and economic systems worldwide. \n\nOrganizations such as Citi address climate change through policies, data initiatives, and stakeholder engagement to mitigate its effects. Prudential aims to combat climate change by promoting sectoral decarbonization, engaging in policy advocacy, and pursuing responsible investment strategies. Bupa considers climate change a significant risk affecting its property and insurance operations, incorporating scenario analysis and risk management processes to assess and respond to these challenges. Similarly, the Phoenix Group integrates environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations into its investment decisions and advocates for supportive policies to facilitate decarbonization efforts.\n\nVestas recognizes climate change as a dual threat alongside energy scarcity, which motivates its sustainability initiatives. The global environmental change driven by climate change influences policy, regulation, and financial sector responses, prompting organizations like ORBIA to incorporate climate considerations into their sustainability and risk management strategies.
