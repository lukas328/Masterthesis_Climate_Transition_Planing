Various organizations are actively working to increase their use of renewable electricity to support their sustainability and emissions reduction goals. Citi has committed to using 100% renewable electricity across its global operations by 2025, with their efforts aimed at reducing operational emissions and achieving net-zero carbon emissions. Similarly, NATWEST GROUP has increased its renewable electricity consumption to 98% as part of its strategy to lower operational emissions. The London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) has implemented initiatives to source 100% renewable electricity through green tariffs, on-site generation, and Energy Attribute Certificates, contributing to its broader sustainability objectives and the reduction of scope 2 emissions. Additionally, organizations are engaging in initiatives such as corporate Power Purchase Agreements (cPPAs) to further decarbonize the UK grid and meet electricity demand with renewable sources. Overall, these efforts reflect a concerted move toward increasing renewable electricity consumption to support climate goals and transition to a low-carbon economy.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1745691317, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_eede8f0d45", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 213, "prompt_tokens": 321, "total_tokens": 534, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
