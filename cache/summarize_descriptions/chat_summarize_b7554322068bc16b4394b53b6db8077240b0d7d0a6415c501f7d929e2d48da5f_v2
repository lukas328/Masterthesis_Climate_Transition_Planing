These loans are arranged by various financial institutions, including Mizuho, BBVA, and Barclays. Mizuho's sustainability-linked loans tie the loan conditions directly to the borrower's sustainability performance targets. BBVA offers sustainability-linked loans that incorporate key performance indicators (KPIs) related to environmental impacts, such as water usage, particularly for sectors with high dependence on water resources, thereby promoting sustainable practices and positive environmental outcomes. Barclays also facilitates such financial products, emphasizing their role in encouraging companies to meet sustainability objectives.
