Scope 3 covers other indirect emissions, such as those associated with the supply chain, financed activities, and other indirect sources. These categories are utilized in various methodologies to assess and report greenhouse gas emissions, including those related to organizations like NatWest Group, which accounts for emissions from activities it finances.
