These sources are promoted and utilized as part of broader efforts to transition away from fossil fuels like coal and to support sustainable development and decarbonization. Various organizations and companies, such as Diageo, Mizuho, Johnson Matthey, Itaú, and Barclays, actively increase their use of renewable energy to reduce their carbon footprints, lower energy demand, and decrease greenhouse gas emissions, particularly Scope 2 emissions. For example, Diageo enhances its use of wind, solar, and other renewables to lower its carbon footprint; Mizuho aims to shift towards renewable energy sources to reduce emission intensity in power generation projects; Johnson Matthey procures or generates renewable electricity on-site to support its sustainability goals; Itaú plans for 80% of its branches to operate on renewable energy by 2025; and Barclays seeks to procure and increase usage of renewable energy sources to meet its targets. Overall, renewable energy plays a crucial role in the transition to less carbon-intensive activities across various sectors and organizations.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1745329629, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_eede8f0d45", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 238, "prompt_tokens": 482, "total_tokens": 720, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
