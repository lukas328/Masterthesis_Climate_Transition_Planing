The division focuses on catalyst development and manufacturing for industries such as refining, chemicals, and fuels, including efforts to support the decarbonisation of chemical and fuel value chains. It produces catalysts and provides related services, including licensing and engineering, and is actively involved in large-scale projects aimed at producing low-carbon hydrogen and sustainable fuels. Catalyst Technologies has a significant goodwill balance, valued at £113 million related to its cash-generating units, and in 2023, the division's goodwill was valued at £268 million. The division's activities include developing catalytic solutions for both traditional fuels and sustainable energy sources, such as decarbonisation initiatives. It is impacted by external and internal market conditions, which have led to reduced sales and operating profit in adverse scenarios. Overall, Catalyst Technologies plays a vital role within Johnson Matthey's portfolio, supporting industrial innovation and sustainability through advanced catalytic technologies.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1745329733, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_8fd43718b3", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 207, "prompt_tokens": 439, "total_tokens": 646, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
