These suppliers provide goods and services such as raw materials, packaging, and other operational support. They are actively engaged in environmental, social, and climate practices, with many participating in training sessions, workshops, and initiatives aimed at promoting sustainable practices and reducing environmental impacts. Suppliers are also involved in environmental management and decarbonization efforts, with some being encouraged to adopt more sustainable practices. Johnson Matthey's supply chain partners, in particular, have their climate risks managed and integrated into business continuity plans. Additionally, key suppliers are assessed for human rights risks, with higher-risk suppliers undergoing enhanced due diligence and mitigation measures to ensure responsible sourcing and social compliance. Overall, these suppliers are targeted for engagement, training on emissions disclosure, and efforts to promote sustainable and responsible practices across their operations.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1745329629, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_eede8f0d45", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 190, "prompt_tokens": 297, "total_tokens": 487, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
