It emphasizes principles of equity, sustainable development, and human rights. The agreement sets global targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and guides national climate commitments, policies, and strategies worldwide. Financial institutions and corporations, including entities like Barclays, GFANZ members, Itaú Unibanco, BBVA, Mizuho, Dai-ichi Life, Robeco, LGIM, SEB, and Diageo, align their climate strategies, decarbonization efforts, and net-zero commitments with the objectives and targets outlined in the Paris Agreement. These organizations incorporate the treaty's guidelines into their climate risk assessments, portfolio management, sectoral pathways, and client engagement policies, supporting global efforts to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 and promoting global decarbonization initiatives. The Paris Agreement serves as a foundational framework influencing both national policies and private sector actions aimed at mitigating climate change and fostering sustainable development worldwide.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1745329629, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_eede8f0d45", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 233, "prompt_tokens": 917, "total_tokens": 1150, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
