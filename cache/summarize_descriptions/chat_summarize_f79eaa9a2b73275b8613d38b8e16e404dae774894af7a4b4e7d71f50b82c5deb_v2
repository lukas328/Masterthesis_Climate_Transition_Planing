BBVA has set 2030 as the deadline for achieving intermediate decarbonization targets across various sectors, including power generation, oil and gas, autos, steel, and cement, specifically within its portfolios in Spain and Mexico. Mizuho aims to be carbon neutral for Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, reflecting its commitment to operational carbon neutrality. Similarly, JLL has established 2030 as the year by which it intends to attain net-zero carbon emissions from its operations. Additionally, by 2030, there is an expectation of significant deployment of renewable energy technologies and improvements in energy efficiency, underscoring a broader industry and corporate shift towards sustainable practices and climate goals.\", \"The year 2030 serves as a pivotal target year for multiple organizations and initiatives in their efforts to combat climate change and achieve sustainability goals. Specifically, Phoenix Group aims to reduce the carbon intensity of all assets under its control by at least 50%, covering approximately £250 billion in assets under administration (AUA), and to further decrease its temperature score to 2.2°C, expanding coverage to all assets it controls and influences. The group has set 2030 as an intermediate milestone for emissions reduction and pathway alignment within its Net Zero Transition Plan.\\n\\nSimilarly, Citi has designated 2030 as a key target year to eliminate its remaining exposure to thermal coal mining companies and to achieve climate alignment across its steel portfolio. It also aims to meet its financed emissions reduction goals and overall climate strategy by this year. NatWest Group plans to reach significant reductions in emissions and attain net zero across its financed emissions and operations by 2030. Additionally, the bank targets a 70% portfolio alignment to net-zero and a 50% reduction in carbon intensity.\\n\\nOther sectors and organizations have set 2030 as a milestone for specific emissions reduction targets: Allianz aims for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions and other climate-related objectives by this year.
