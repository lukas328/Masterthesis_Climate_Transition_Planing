It serves as a global framework guiding countries' climate targets and actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change. The agreement emphasizes the importance of a just transition to a low-carbon economy and recognizes the differentiated responsibilities of developed and emerging economies. It influences national commitments and the climate strategies of various organizations, including financial institutions like NatWest Group, Prudential plc, Citi, Phoenix Group, and Ninety One, which align their climate ambitions and decarbonization efforts with its objectives. The Paris Agreement also guides the transition plans of supported companies, informs climate policies, and underpins initiatives such as renewable energy policies supported by entities like Vestas. Additionally, it is used as a benchmark to measure countries' progress in climate action, exemplified by indices like the Ninety One Net-zero Sovereign Index. Overall, the Paris Agreement is a central international treaty that promotes global efforts to limit climate change and foster low-carbon development worldwide.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1745691310, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_8fd43718b3", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 233, "prompt_tokens": 820, "total_tokens": 1053, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
