It enables companies, cities, states, and regions to measure, manage, and disclose their environmental impacts, including greenhouse gas emissions, climate strategies, water usage, and forest-related data. CDP provides standardized reporting frameworks and benchmarks, such as the 2022 Climate Change Survey, which assesses company performance and transparency; for example, NatWest Group scored a B. The platform is widely used by organizations like Prudential, Citi, and Ninety One to gather climate data, assess exposure to climate-related risks, and improve data transparency and quality. Additionally, CDP certifies renewable energy certificates and supports environmental reporting initiatives. Established in 2010, the organization has engaged with numerous companies, with around 8% of those engaged in 2023 committing to disclose their environmental data through CDP. Overall, CDP plays a crucial role in facilitating environmental reporting and disclosure, contributing vital data for climate risk assessment and sustainability strategies worldwide.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1745691332, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_8fd43718b3", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 211, "prompt_tokens": 612, "total_tokens": 823, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
