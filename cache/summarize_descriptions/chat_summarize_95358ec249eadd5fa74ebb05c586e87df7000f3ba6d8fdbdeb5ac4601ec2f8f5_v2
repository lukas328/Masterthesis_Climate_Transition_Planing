Specifically, for Aviva, Scope 2 emissions are targeted for reduction as part of their sustainability plan. Johnson Matthey's Scope 2 emissions originate from the generation of purchased electricity, steam, and heating used by the company. Diageo's Scope 2 emissions include indirect emissions from purchased energy such as electricity and heating, which the company aims to decrease by increasing the use of renewable energy sources. Similarly, Barclays considers Scope 2 emissions as indirect emissions from purchased electricity and aims to reduce these emissions in terms of emission intensity. Overall, Scope 2 encompasses the indirect emissions associated with the energy purchased and consumed by these organizations, with each company actively working towards reducing their Scope 2 emissions through various strategies, including increasing renewable energy use.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1745329629, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_eede8f0d45", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 179, "prompt_tokens": 257, "total_tokens": 436, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
