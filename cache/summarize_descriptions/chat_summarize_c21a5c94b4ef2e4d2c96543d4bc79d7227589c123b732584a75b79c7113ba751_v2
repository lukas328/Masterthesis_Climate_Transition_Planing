It is tasked with setting and approving Bupa’s purpose, values, strategy, and sustainability initiatives, including climate-related strategies and transition plans. The Board ensures that Bupa’s culture aligns with its purpose and values, and it oversees the development and execution of governance activities such as succession planning, evaluation, and sustainability strategy approval. It approves risk appetite statements, risk management policies, and monitors overall risk, including climate change and sustainability risks. The Board delegates certain responsibilities to committees—such as Nomination, Governance, Remuneration, Risk, Sustainability, and Audit—and receives reports from these committees to inform strategic decision-making. Comprising a majority of independent Non-Executive Directors, the Board provides high-level oversight of management, strategic direction, and corporate governance, including gender balance initiatives. It also oversees the effectiveness of governance practices and evaluates its own performance. Additionally, the Board of Bupa is involved in strategic oversight related to climate change, monitoring progress against climate targets, and approving climate transition plans. Similar governance responsibilities are observed in other entities like NatWest Group and Prudential plc, where the Boards oversee strategic aims, climate-related risks, sustainability commitments, and monitor progress through various committees.
