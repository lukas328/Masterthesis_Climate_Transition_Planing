This transition is a central theme in various organizations' strategies and initiatives. For instance, NATWEST GROUP, established in 2022 as part of its strategic focus area, supports decarbonization by financing large-scale energy infrastructure, supporting growth businesses, and adopting innovative technologies such as hydrogen, carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS), and clean transportation. Similarly, Citi incorporates energy transition into its climate strategy and the CET group, emphasizing the move from high-carbon energy sources to cleaner energy solutions. Vestas actively advocates for policies supporting this shift and engages in efforts to promote renewable energy adoption worldwide. Overall, energy transition is recognized as a crucial component of climate finance initiatives and sustainable development efforts across various sectors and organizations.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1745691354, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_8fd43718b3", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 169, "prompt_tokens": 283, "total_tokens": 452, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
