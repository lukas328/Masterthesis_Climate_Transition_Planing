These emissions, primarily comprising gases like CO2, contribute significantly to climate change. Financial institutions and corporations, including entities like Barclays and CRF, actively measure, report, and aim to reduce GHG emissions across their operations and portfolios in line with net-zero transition goals. CRF has committed to reducing its portfolioâ€™s GHG emissions to net zero by 2040, while Johnson Matthey has set targets aligned with the SBTi Net Zero Standard to reduce emissions intensity. Emissions are categorized into Scope 1 (direct emissions), Scope 2 (indirect emissions from purchased energy), and Scope 3 (other indirect emissions, including those from supply chains and financed assets), which are central to climate reporting and reduction strategies. Sector-specific GHG data are used to evaluate transition risks and inform climate strategies. Overall, the goal is to measure, report, and reduce greenhouse gases associated with energy activities, physical assets, and financed investments, with a focus on tracking progress through emissions data and reduction targets.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1745329660, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_eede8f0d45", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 244, "prompt_tokens": 525, "total_tokens": 769, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
