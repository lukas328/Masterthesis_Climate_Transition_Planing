For Citi, climate risk is a key focus area within its risk management framework, with dedicated teams and evolving governance structures established since 2021 to monitor, assess, and integrate climate-related factors into their risk processes. This includes understanding both physical risks—such as damage from extreme weather events—and transition risks associated with the shift to a low-carbon economy. Regulators and financial institutions actively monitor and regulate these risks to ensure financial stability. Similarly, Orbia identifies and manages climate risks through its governance and strategic planning processes, recognizing the potential impacts of climate change on its financial statements. These impacts are assessed through management inquiries, internal reporting, and external publications, emphasizing the importance of integrating climate considerations into overall risk management and strategic decision-making.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1745691216, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_eede8f0d45", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 169, "prompt_tokens": 259, "total_tokens": 428, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
