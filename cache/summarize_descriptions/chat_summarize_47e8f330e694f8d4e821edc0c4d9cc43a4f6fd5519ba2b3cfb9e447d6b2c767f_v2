It offers various strategic scenarios, including the Net Zero 2050 (NZE2050) and Net Zero Emissions (NZE) scenarios, which serve as benchmarks for emissions reduction targets and energy transition planning. These scenarios outline critical measures such as phasing out unabated coal power plants globally by 2040, halting the approval of new oil and gas fields after 2021, and supporting a rapid shift away from fossil fuels to achieve net zero emissions. The IEA's pathways are utilized by financial institutions like Barclays and BBVA to set and guide their climate and emission reduction targets. Additionally, the IEA provides the Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS) and supplies literature that supplements scenarios from other organizations like the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) for sector-specific analyses, including the automobile industry. Overall, the IEA plays a vital role in supporting global efforts toward decarbonization and sustainable energy transitions through its projections, scenario development, and policy guidance.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1745329660, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_eede8f0d45", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 232, "prompt_tokens": 432, "total_tokens": 664, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
