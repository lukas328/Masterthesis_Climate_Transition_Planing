Specifically, Phoenix Group aims to reduce the carbon intensity of all assets under its control by at least 50%, covering approximately £250 billion in assets under administration (AUA), and to further decrease its temperature score to 2.2°C, expanding coverage to all assets it controls and influences. The group has set 2030 as an intermediate milestone for emissions reduction and pathway alignment within its Net Zero Transition Plan.\n\nSimilarly, Citi has designated 2030 as a key target year to eliminate its remaining exposure to thermal coal mining companies and to achieve climate alignment across its steel portfolio. It also aims to meet its financed emissions reduction goals and overall climate strategy by this year. NatWest Group plans to reach significant reductions in emissions and attain net zero across its financed emissions and operations by 2030. Additionally, the bank targets a 70% portfolio alignment to net-zero and a 50% reduction in carbon intensity.\n\nOther sectors and organizations have set 2030 as a milestone for specific emissions reduction targets: Allianz aims for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions and other climate-related objectives by this year. In the transportation and energy sectors, 2030 is viewed as the year by which electric vehicles are expected to become the dominant new vehicle type, and electricity generation is projected to be predominantly renewable. Furthermore, supply chain efforts include a goal to reduce supply chain carbon intensity by 50% from a 2019 baseline.\n\nOverall, 2030 is recognized as a critical deadline for achieving substantial progress in emissions reductions, decarbonization milestones, and broader climate and energy transition objectives across financial institutions, insurance companies, and energy sectors.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1745691331, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_eede8f0d45", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 354, "prompt_tokens": 487, "total_tokens": 841, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
