As of May 2022, PCAF has over 260 members managing more than USD 73 trillion in assets. PCAF provides comprehensive methodologies for calculating financed emissions based on attribution principles, emission factors, and regional data, covering various sectors such as Oil & Gas and Mining. The organization promotes transparency in climate-related financial reporting and offers scoring systems from 1 to 5 to evaluate the quality of emissions data used in sustainability disclosures. Several major financial institutions, including BBVA, Barclays, Mizuho, and Itaú Unibanco, have adopted PCAF's methodologies for their carbon accounting and emissions assessments. PCAF's work includes developing standards for measuring and disclosing the carbon footprint of financial portfolios, with initiatives such as co-chairing working groups on capital markets activities. Overall, PCAF plays a crucial role in advancing consistent, transparent, and reliable climate-related financial reporting within the global financial industry.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1745329661, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_eede8f0d45", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 230, "prompt_tokens": 711, "total_tokens": 941, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
