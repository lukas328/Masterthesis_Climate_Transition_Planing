This includes emissions from activities such as supply chain operations, business travel, purchased goods and services, raw materials, packaging, logistics, and other related indirect sources. Various companies, including Mizuho, Aviva, Barclays, Johnson Matthey, and Diageo, are actively monitoring and working to reduce their Scope 3 emissions. Mizuho is gradually setting sector-specific mid-term targets for these emissions; Aviva aims to reduce emissions from its supply chain and value chain by 50% from 2020 levels by 2030; Barclays targets reductions across its supply chain and business travel; Johnson Matthey reports on and seeks to decrease all other indirect emissions in its value chain; and Diageo tracks and aims to minimize emissions from raw materials, packaging, logistics, and other parts of its value chain. Overall, Scope 3 encompasses all other indirect emissions associated with a company's operations, and these organizations are committed to comprehensive emission reduction strategies within this category.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1745329629, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_eede8f0d45", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 217, "prompt_tokens": 385, "total_tokens": 602, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
