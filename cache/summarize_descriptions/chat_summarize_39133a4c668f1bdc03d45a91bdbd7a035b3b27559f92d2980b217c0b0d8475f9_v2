It involves defining roles, responsibilities, and leadership frameworks to oversee and support the implementation of sustainability initiatives. In practice, governance includes organizational frameworks, oversight mechanisms, and regular review processes designed to guide and monitor climate transition efforts. \n\nFor financial institutions such as BBVA, governance models integrate sustainability into their corporate structures, including the roles of corporate bodies and transversal integration into executive decision-making. BBVA's governance framework incorporates policies, effectiveness reviews, and mechanisms like meetings and oversight committees to ensure proper guidance and monitoring of climate governance and transition activities. Similarly, SEB employs governance and policy frameworks to steer its climate and transition strategies, emphasizing oversight and strategic direction.\n\nOther organizations, including Johnson Matthey and Itaú, implement governance practices that involve oversight, strategy setting, and risk management by their Boards and committees. These practices include regular assessments of board effectiveness, skills, diversity, and succession planning, ensuring that governance remains robust and aligned with transition goals. The governance structures also extend to stakeholder engagement, executive remuneration, and disclosures related to climate strategies.\n\nOverall, these organizations establish comprehensive governance frameworks that oversee, review, and update their net-zero transition plans and related policies, ensuring accountability, strategic alignment, and effective management of climate-related risks and opportunities.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1745329670, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_eede8f0d45", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 282, "prompt_tokens": 506, "total_tokens": 788, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
