The SBTi sets these targets to ensure that corporate emission reduction efforts are consistent with the goals of limiting global temperature rise. Its initiatives include approving companies' near-term emission reduction targets, such as those of the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG), and validating corporate climate commitments, exemplified by Vestas' net-zero trajectory aligned with the 1.5°C scenario. Overall, the SBTi plays a crucial role in guiding and certifying corporate climate action to meet global climate targets.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1745691398, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_eede8f0d45", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 148, "prompt_tokens": 230, "total_tokens": 378, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
