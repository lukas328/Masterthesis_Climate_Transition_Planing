It offers detailed information on global energy demand, including trends in coal consumption, and develops scenario models such as the Net Zero Scenario and the Net Zero by 2050 roadmap to guide international efforts toward decarbonization. The IEA advocates for a rapid transition away from fossil fuels to achieve net zero emissions and supports this goal through analysis of energy sources, national carbon intensity factors, and climate scenarios. Its guidance informs energy policies and strategies for decarbonization, including sector-specific pathways toward achieving net zero emissions by 2050. The organization’s research and scenario models are utilized by various stakeholders, such as financial institutions like NZBA, to set decarbonization targets and develop strategies aligned with global climate objectives.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1745329651, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_eede8f0d45", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 180, "prompt_tokens": 471, "total_tokens": 651, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
