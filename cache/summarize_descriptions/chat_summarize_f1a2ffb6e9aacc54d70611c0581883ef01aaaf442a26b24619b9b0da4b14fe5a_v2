It involves balancing emitted greenhouse gases with removals or offsets, representing the ultimate goal of climate transition plans for organizations and countries. Achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 is a central focus of international climate policy and financial sector commitments, guiding policy development and investment strategies. Various entities have set specific interim and sector-specific targets to reach this goal; for example, LGIM has committed to managing 70% of its investments in line with net-zero objectives by 2030, while Itaú has incorporated net-zero into its climate strategy. Additionally, JLL has committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2040. Overall, net-zero signifies a state where greenhouse gas emissions are effectively balanced by removals or offsets, marking a critical milestone in the global effort to mitigate climate change.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1745329723, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_eede8f0d45", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 184, "prompt_tokens": 382, "total_tokens": 566, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
