The IEA offers detailed climate scenarios, including the 1.5°C-aligned scenario, which serves as a baseline for setting corporate and financial sector climate policies. Additionally, the IEA produces estimates and reports on the global energy transition, highlighting the expected decline in fossil fuel use by 2050. Its guidance and strategic roadmaps, such as the \"Net Zero by 2050\" report, significantly influence the climate strategies of organizations like Barclays. Furthermore, the IEA's emission trajectories and net-zero scenarios assist BBVA in assessing the alignment of its loan portfolio with global climate goals, particularly in sectors such as autos, power, steel, and cement, thereby supporting the transition to a more sustainable energy future.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1745329678, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_eede8f0d45", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 188, "prompt_tokens": 288, "total_tokens": 476, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
