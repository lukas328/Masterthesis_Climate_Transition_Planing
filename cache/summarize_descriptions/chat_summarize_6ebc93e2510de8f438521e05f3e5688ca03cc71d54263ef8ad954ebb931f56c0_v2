The country has seen strategic growth through acquisitions, including Med-Polonia Sp. z.o.o. Additionally, Poland has made efforts to increase its renewable energy consumption, with 12 sites switching to renewable electricity contracts, raising renewable energy use from 42% in 2021 to approximately 50%. The healthcare infrastructure in Poland is also subject to financial valuation practices, with hospitals being valued based on discounted cash flow. Furthermore, innovative health initiatives have been introduced, such as Bupa's digital back pain prevention program for customers.
