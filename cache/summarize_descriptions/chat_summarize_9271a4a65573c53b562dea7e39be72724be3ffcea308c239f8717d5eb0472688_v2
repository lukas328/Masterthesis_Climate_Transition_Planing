It provides comprehensive guidance, frameworks, and standards for setting corporate net-zero commitments that are aligned with global climate goals, including the Paris Agreement and the goal to limit global warming to 1.5°C. The SBTi assesses and approves corporate targets, such as Johnson Matthey's 2040 net zero goal, ensuring they meet rigorous science-based criteria. It covers all emission scopes—Scope 1, 2, and 3—and offers metrics and guidance for sectors including aviation. The organization also collaborates with companies like JLL to develop climate standards and certify targets, thereby facilitating consistent and credible climate action across industries. Overall, the SBTi plays a crucial role in guiding, standardizing, and endorsing corporate efforts to achieve net-zero emissions through science-based strategies.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1745329723, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_eede8f0d45", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 190, "prompt_tokens": 574, "total_tokens": 764, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
