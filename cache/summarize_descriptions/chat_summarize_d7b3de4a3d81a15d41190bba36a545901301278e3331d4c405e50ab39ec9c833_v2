Physical risks include extreme weather events such as flooding, which can adversely affect a bank's operations and assets. Transition risks involve regulatory changes, technological advancements, and shifts in policy related to climate change that may influence revenue, profitability, and asset exposure. Financial institutions, including banks like Itaú Unibanco, assess and manage these risks through strategic initiatives and development of transition plans. Organizations such as Aviva and Robeco also aim to address climate-related risks by implementing comprehensive transition strategies. Overall, climate risk involves potential adverse impacts stemming from climate change, and effective management of these risks is crucial for enhancing resilience and ensuring sustainable financial stability.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1745330118, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_eede8f0d45", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 144, "prompt_tokens": 311, "total_tokens": 455, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
