It is applied in various contexts, such as assessing sectoral targets in industries like real estate and estimating emissions avoided through electricity generation. Specifically, emissions intensity can refer to the average amount of CO2 equivalent (CO2e) emissions produced per kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity generated. Additionally, emissions intensity values are tracked over multiple years, such as for 2020, 2021, and 2022, to indicate the amount of emissions per unit of production during those periods. This comprehensive measure helps evaluate and compare the environmental impact of different activities and sectors over time.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1745691420, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_eede8f0d45", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 138, "prompt_tokens": 203, "total_tokens": 341, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
