Initially adopted by Mizuho Bank in 2003, making it the first Asian financial institution to do so, these principles serve as an international framework for responsible project financing. They are designed to help financial institutions identify, assess, and manage environmental and social risks associated with their project finance activities. The Equator Principles are adhered to by various financial institutions, including BBVA and Itaú Unibanco, which implement these standards to ensure responsible financing practices. BBVA, for example, applies the Equator Principles to projects affecting indigenous communities, while Itaú Unibanco focuses on managing climate change-related impacts based on International Finance Corporation (IFC) standards. Overall, the Equator Principles promote sustainable development by encouraging clients in sensitive sectors, such as energy, to adhere to responsible environmental and social practices.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1745329661, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_8fd43718b3", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 191, "prompt_tokens": 258, "total_tokens": 449, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
