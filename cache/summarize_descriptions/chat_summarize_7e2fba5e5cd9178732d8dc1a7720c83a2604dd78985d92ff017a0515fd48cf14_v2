Specifically, the IEA's Net Zero Emissions (NZE) scenario is used to guide NatWest Group's downstream emissions modeling, helping the bank assess and manage its carbon footprint. Additionally, the IEA's various scenarios, including sectoral pathways, are utilized to inform NatWest Group’s sectoral decarbonization strategies and emissions assessments. The IEA's Beyond 2°C Scenario is also employed by NatWest Group to model future emissions reductions and to set appropriate targets for achieving significant decarbonization. Overall, the IEA's scenario analyses play a vital role in shaping NatWest Group's approach to sustainability and climate risk management.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1745691757, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_8fd43718b3", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 154, "prompt_tokens": 201, "total_tokens": 355, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
