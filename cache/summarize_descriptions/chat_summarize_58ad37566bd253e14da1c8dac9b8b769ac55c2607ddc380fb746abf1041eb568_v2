It produces comprehensive reports that inform global climate policies and targets, serving as a critical resource for policymakers worldwide. The IPCC develops and provides climate scenarios, such as RCP 8.5, RCP 2.6, and the 1.5°C pathway, which are used for scenario analysis, risk assessments, and evaluating physical risks associated with climate change. Additionally, the IPCC creates climate models and frameworks, including the Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs), to support understanding of future climate impacts. Its assessments and scenario development play a vital role in guiding science-based target setting for sectors and organizations, such as the NZBA, and in informing global efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1745329643, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_8fd43718b3", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 175, "prompt_tokens": 297, "total_tokens": 472, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
