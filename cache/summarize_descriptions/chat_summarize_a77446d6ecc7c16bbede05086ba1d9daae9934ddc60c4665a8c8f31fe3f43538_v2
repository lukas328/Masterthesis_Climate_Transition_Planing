The IPCC provides comprehensive scientific assessments on the causes, impacts, and potential mitigation and adaptation strategies for climate change. It emphasizes the importance of limiting global warming to 1.5°C and highlights the urgent need for a rapid transition away from fossil fuels. The IPCC develops and updates methodologies for greenhouse gas inventories and produces climate scenarios, such as RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5, which are used to evaluate physical risks and inform policy decisions. Its reports support the development of science-based targets and objectives in net-zero plans, and its findings are frequently cited in policy and corporate strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Overall, the IPCC plays a crucial role in informing global climate action by providing scientifically grounded assessments that guide mitigation efforts, sectoral pathways, and energy transition strategies worldwide.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1745329661, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_eede8f0d45", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 195, "prompt_tokens": 537, "total_tokens": 732, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
