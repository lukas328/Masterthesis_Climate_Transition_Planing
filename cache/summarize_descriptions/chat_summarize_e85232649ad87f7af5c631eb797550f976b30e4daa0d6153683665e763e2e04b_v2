It is used as the previous reporting year for comparison of climate and sustainable funding data, as well as for financial and personnel data, including employee demographics, hirings, departures, and parental leave. In Bupa's financial reports, 2021 is cited as the previous year for comparative financial figures, such as zero (£nil) and £150 million drawdowns. The year 2021 is also associated with specific financial transactions and gains, including interest income and investment gains. Additionally, NatWest Group reports its emissions estimates and sector data for 2021, which also serves as a baseline for decarbonization metrics. The organization's assets under administration (AUA) at the end of 2021 are recorded as a baseline for decarbonization efforts. Furthermore, in 2021, the company recognized £8 million of amortization and a £10 million impairment loss on bed licenses. In the agricultural sector, 2021 marks the year when BRF began implementing rings in the swine genetic chain and started phasing out mutilation procedures.
