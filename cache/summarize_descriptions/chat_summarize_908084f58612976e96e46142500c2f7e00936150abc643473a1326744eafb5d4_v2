It develops frameworks and standards, including the Net-Zero Standard, to ensure that corporate climate actions are consistent with pathways to limit global warming to 1.5°C. The SBTi assesses and approves companies' emission reduction targets, providing guidance to organizations such as Aviva and Diageo, helping them establish credible targets that support their climate commitments. Additionally, the SBTi collaborates with various sectors, including the financial industry, to facilitate the transition to net-zero emissions, exemplified by its partnership with JLL to certify JLL's commitment to achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040. Overall, the SBTi plays a crucial role in guiding and certifying corporate climate strategies to ensure alignment with global climate science and the goal of limiting global warming.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1745329629, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_eede8f0d45", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 194, "prompt_tokens": 306, "total_tokens": 500, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
