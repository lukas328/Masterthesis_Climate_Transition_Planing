These include various climate change models, such as the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), which assess physical risks and impacts on assets and supply chains under scenarios from best estimate to extreme conditions. Additionally, different future pathways—namely Orderly transition, Abrupt transition, Hot house world, Too little, too late—are employed by Itaú Unibanco to model potential climate impacts and inform strategic planning. These pathways represent diverse transition scenarios, including rapid, pragmatic, and slow transitions, and are used to evaluate potential climate impacts comprehensively. Specific scenarios like the IEA Net-Zero pathway are also utilized by Itaú to guide decarbonization targets and strategic decision-making. Overall, these climate scenarios serve as essential tools for planning, forecasting, and stress testing, enabling organizations to prepare for a range of possible future climate conditions.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1745329810, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_eede8f0d45", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 199, "prompt_tokens": 307, "total_tokens": 506, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
