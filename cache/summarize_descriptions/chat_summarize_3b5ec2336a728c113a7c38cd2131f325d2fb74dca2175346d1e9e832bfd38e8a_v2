For Bupa, these risks include those associated with climate change that may influence its business lines and geographic regions, and are overseen by various governance committees, including the Risk Committee and its sub-committees. These risks may arise from physical climate changes and transition policies, which could affect Bupa’s operations and assets. Similarly, for Orbia, climate-related risks involve physical climate changes and transition policies that could impact its operations and assets, with these risks being integrated into its enterprise risk management framework since 2020.
