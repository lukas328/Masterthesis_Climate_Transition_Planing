These derivatives are employed to manage interest rate exposure effectively, with their valuation based on discounting future cash flows. Johnson Matthey uses interest rate swaps, including cross-currency swaps, to align their hedging strategies with their bond maturities and overall financial risk management objectives. In 2023, the group held interest rate swaps valued at approximately £20 million, with non-current assets related to these derivatives valued at £20 million and associated liabilities at around (£15) million. The company maintains these derivatives with several banks to reduce counterparty risk and to ensure a diversified and robust hedging approach. The valuation of these interest rate swaps has seen changes between 2021 and 2023, reflecting fluctuations in market conditions and interest rates. Overall, Johnson Matthey's use of interest rate swaps forms a key part of their financial risk management strategy to mitigate the impact of interest rate fluctuations on their financial position.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1745329961, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_eede8f0d45", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 200, "prompt_tokens": 417, "total_tokens": 617, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
