Johnson Matthey's systematic approach involves integrating climate risk considerations into its enterprise risk management processes, with formal reviews conducted twice a year to monitor and evaluate these risks. Similarly, BBVA incorporates climate change into its risk planning by identifying, measuring, and managing climate-related risks within its overall risk management framework. Itaú utilizes specific processes and methodologies to identify, assess, and address both physical and transition climate risks. Overall, these organizations employ structured strategies to proactively manage climate-related financial and operational risks, ensuring resilience and alignment with their climate strategies.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1745329670, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_eede8f0d45", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 151, "prompt_tokens": 331, "total_tokens": 482, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
