These emissions are associated with grid electricity consumption and reflect the indirect impact of energy purchased by these organizations. Several entities have set targets to reduce their Scope 2 emissions; for example, Phoenix Group aims to achieve a 50% reduction in indirect emissions from purchased electricity, heat, or steam by 2030 and a 35% reduction in indirect energy emissions by 2030, with a specific goal to reduce these emissions by 2025. The shift from location-based to market-based emissions accounting is also noted, emphasizing efforts to more accurately measure and manage these indirect emissions. Overall, Scope 2 encompasses the indirect emissions from purchased energy sources that these organizations are actively working to reduce through various sustainability initiatives.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1745691144, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_eede8f0d45", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 192, "prompt_tokens": 457, "total_tokens": 649, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
