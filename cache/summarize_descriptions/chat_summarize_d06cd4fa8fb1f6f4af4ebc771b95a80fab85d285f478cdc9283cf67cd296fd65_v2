It is characterized by significant greenhouse gas emissions, particularly CO2 and methane, which are included in various emissions reporting frameworks such as Barclays' scope of emissions measurement. The industry contributes substantially to industrial emissions and is affected by environmental regulations and market shifts related to the low-carbon transition. \n\nAs a sector targeted for transition support, the steel industry faces increased costs associated with decarbonization efforts, including investments in cleaner technologies and efforts to reduce emission intensity against baseline levels established in 2021. These efforts are part of broader climate targets and reduction strategies aimed at lowering greenhouse gas emissions. \n\nThe industry is also subject to physical climate risks and transition risks, with evaluations conducted by financial institutions such as BBVA and Mizuho. BBVA's transition scorecard assesses the steel sector's low-carbon profile and decarbonization objectives, highlighting its high transition risk due to the need for significant changes in production processes and energy consumption. Mizuho's policies for engagement and risk management emphasize the importance of supporting the sector through the low-carbon transition, recognizing its role in manufacturing and its vulnerability to policy and market changes.\n\nOverall, the steel industry is a critical focus for climate-related financial and environmental strategies, with ongoing efforts to reduce emissions, manage transition risks, and adapt to evolving regulatory and market conditions driven by climate change mitigation policies.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1745329643, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_8fd43718b3", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 291, "prompt_tokens": 396, "total_tokens": 687, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
