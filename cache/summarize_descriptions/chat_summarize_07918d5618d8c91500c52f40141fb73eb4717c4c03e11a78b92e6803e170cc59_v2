It offers various strategic scenarios, including the Net Zero 2050 (NZE2050) and Net Zero Emissions (NZE) scenarios, which serve as benchmarks for emissions reduction targets and energy transition planning. These scenarios outline critical measures such as phasing out unabated coal power plants globally by 2040, halting the approval of new oil and gas fields after 2021, and supporting a rapid shift away from fossil fuels to achieve net zero emissions. The IEA's pathways are utilized by financial institutions like Barclays and BBVA to set and guide their climate and emission reduction targets.
