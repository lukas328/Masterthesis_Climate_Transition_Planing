It develops and publishes various climate and energy scenarios, such as the Net Zero Emissions (NZE), Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS), Beyond 2°C World (B2DS), and transition scenarios, which are used by organizations like Citi to benchmark decarbonization pathways and calibrate decarbonization targets. The IEA's scenarios model future emissions reductions in sectors including oil and gas, and they are instrumental in guiding energy and climate policies worldwide. Additionally, the IEA supplies data on global electricity emissions intensity, which companies like Vestas utilize to calculate emissions avoided through wind energy. Overall, the IEA plays a crucial role in providing energy data, scenario models, and emission factors essential for understanding and achieving global climate and energy transition goals.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1745691146, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_8fd43718b3", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 187, "prompt_tokens": 381, "total_tokens": 568, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
