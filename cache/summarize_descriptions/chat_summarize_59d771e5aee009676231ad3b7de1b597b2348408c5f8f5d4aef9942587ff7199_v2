Firstly, EPC supports the launch of shadow operational limits related to transition and physical flood risk data, which are used to monitor the performance of mortgage portfolios, thereby aiding risk management and decision-making processes. Secondly, EPC stands for Energy Performance Certificate, a standardized rating system used to assess the energy efficiency of properties. This assessment influences lending and risk management decisions within the bank's mortgage portfolio and provides estimates of emissions for residential mortgages. Lastly, EPC also pertains to Engineering, Procurement, and Construction projects in the wind energy sector, involving the design, procurement, and construction of wind farms, particularly in emerging markets. These EPC projects are crucial for developing wind energy infrastructure and contribute to sustainable energy initiatives.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1745691319, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_eede8f0d45", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 155, "prompt_tokens": 293, "total_tokens": 448, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
