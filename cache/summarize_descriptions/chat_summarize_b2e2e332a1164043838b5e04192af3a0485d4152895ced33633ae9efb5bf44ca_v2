These efforts include implementing plans to reduce overall energy consumption, such as relocating to more energy-efficient buildings and adopting technologies designed to lower energy use. Organizations like Phoenix Group have undertaken measures to enhance energy efficiency within their operations, including initiatives to improve residential energy performance through mortgage incentives and retrofit programs. Additionally, efforts focus on reducing energy consumption in buildings and systems to decrease emissions, with specific measures such as improving warehouse energy use through LED lighting and waste reduction projects, exemplified by Wincanton. The assessment of energy efficiency also involves rating buildings from A (best) to G (worst), which is used to evaluate residential mortgage portfolios and support climate-related ambitions. Overall, these combined actions reflect a comprehensive approach to improving energy use, reducing operational emissions, and supporting sustainability goals.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1745691309, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_eede8f0d45", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 183, "prompt_tokens": 302, "total_tokens": 485, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
