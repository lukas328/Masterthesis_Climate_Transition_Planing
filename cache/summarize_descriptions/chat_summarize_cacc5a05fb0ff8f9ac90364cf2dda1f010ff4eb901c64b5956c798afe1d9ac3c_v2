It provides comprehensive reports and scenarios that inform global climate policies, targets, and risk assessments. The IPCC's assessments are utilized by various organizations, including financial institutions like Citi, to conduct climate risk and scenario analyses. Additionally, the IPCC supplies global warming potential (GWP) values used to calculate total CO2 equivalent (CO2e) emissions, notably from its Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). The IPCC warns that if current emission trends continue, global temperatures could rise by more than 1.5°C in the 2030s, highlighting the urgency of addressing climate change.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1745691531, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_eede8f0d45", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 144, "prompt_tokens": 297, "total_tokens": 441, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
