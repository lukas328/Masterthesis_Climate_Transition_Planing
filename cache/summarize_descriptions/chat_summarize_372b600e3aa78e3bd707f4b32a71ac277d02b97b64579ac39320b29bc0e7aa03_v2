TCFD provides comprehensive guidance on climate risk reporting, including metrics, targets, and disclosures related to emissions, climate risks, and opportunities. Many organizations, such as Citi and Prudential, align their climate reporting with TCFD's standards, utilizing its frameworks to improve data coverage and quality. TCFD's guidance is referenced in corporate climate strategies, including Citi's approach to climate change and net zero commitments, and it guides annual disclosures on emissions, transition plans, and climate-related risks. The organization also publishes reports that include approaches to climate change and strategies for achieving net zero, thereby supporting organizations in setting science-based targets and enhancing transparency in their climate-related financial disclosures.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1745691331, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_eede8f0d45", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 185, "prompt_tokens": 728, "total_tokens": 913, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
