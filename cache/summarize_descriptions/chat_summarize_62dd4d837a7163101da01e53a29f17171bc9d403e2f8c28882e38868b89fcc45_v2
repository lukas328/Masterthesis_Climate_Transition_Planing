These emissions are partially estimated in various reports and are a key focus of climate strategies for multiple organizations. For example, TD Bank has set interim targets to reduce emissions across its value chain, including specific goals for key sectors and the electric power sector by FY2030. Similarly, Diageo aims to reduce its Scope 3 emissions from its entire value chain by 50% by 2030. BBVA also emphasizes the importance of helping its clients reduce Scope 3 emissions within their value chains. Overall, Scope 3 emissions represent a significant portion of an organization’s total greenhouse gas footprint and are central to efforts to meet climate targets and reduce overall carbon impact.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1745329629, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_eede8f0d45", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 174, "prompt_tokens": 310, "total_tokens": 484, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
