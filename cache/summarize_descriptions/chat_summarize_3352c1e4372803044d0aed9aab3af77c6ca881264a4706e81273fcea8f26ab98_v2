It provides guidance, standards, and methodologies—such as Sectoral Decarbonization Approach and Temperature Rating Methodology—to help companies develop credible pathways for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. SBTi also validates corporate climate targets to ensure they meet rigorous climate science criteria, including sector-specific emissions intensities and decarbonization pathways. Many organizations, including Phoenix Group, NatWest Group, Orbia, and BRF, have committed to SBTi's standards and have had their targets validated by the organization. For example, Phoenix Group has committed to reducing Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 47% by 2030 and aims to achieve net-zero emissions, with SBTi providing guidance and validation for these goals. Similarly, NatWest Group has aligned its decarbonization plans with SBTi guidance and has had its climate targets, including achieving net zero by 2050, validated by the organization. Overall, SBTi plays a crucial role in helping companies worldwide set credible, science-based climate targets and pathways to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions in line with global climate science.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1745691189, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_eede8f0d45", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 256, "prompt_tokens": 1020, "total_tokens": 1276, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
