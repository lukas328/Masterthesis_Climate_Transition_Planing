It is actively involved in efforts to increase the adoption of electric vehicles and reduce emissions, particularly within the motor insurance sector through collaborations with companies like Allianz. The country hosts numerous renewable energy projects and financing deals, including solar and wind portfolios, reflecting its strong commitment to renewable energy development. In the financial sector, BBVA has substantial operations in Spain, where it promotes solar self-consumption, sustainable mobility, and the standardized collection of energy efficiency data for mortgages. BBVA also manages sustainable investment funds through its asset management division and is focused on achieving net-zero emissions in its banking operations and asset management by 2050. Spain is identified as a key region for BBVA's sustainability initiatives and reporting, with a notable concentration of high or very high transition risk exposure, especially within the automotive sector.\n\nIn addition to its environmental efforts, Spain is a significant location for healthcare services provided by Bupa. Bupa operates clinics and hospitals across the country, offering a range of health services. The company emphasizes transparency and equality by reporting gender pay gap data across multiple healthcare sectors. Bupa has implemented digital health solutions such as Blua and is engaged in sustainability initiatives, including piloting sustainable dental uniforms and running programs like eco-Disruptive to promote environmental sustainability. The Bupa Sanitas Foundation in Spain organizes inclusive sports events, supports health initiatives, and hosts the Healthy Cities program aimed at urban health and environmental regeneration.
