Specifically, for Aviva, Scope 2 emissions are targeted for reduction as part of their sustainability plan. Johnson Matthey's Scope 2 emissions originate from the generation of purchased electricity, steam, and heating used by the company. Diageo's Scope 2 emissions include indirect emissions from purchased energy such as electricity and heating, which the company aims to decrease by increasing the use of renewable energy sources. Similarly, Barclays considers Scope 2 emissions as indirect emissions from purchased electricity and aims to reduce these emissions in terms of emission intensity. Overall, Scope 2 encompasses the indirect emissions associated with the energy purchased and consumed by these organizations, with each company actively working towards reducing their Scope 2 emissions through various strategies, including increasing renewable energy use.\"]\n#######\nOutput:\n", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 500, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
