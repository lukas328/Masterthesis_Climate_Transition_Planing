Specifically, it is used as the baseline year for assessing reductions in carbon intensity and greenhouse gas emissions within various climate transition plans. Several organizations, including BRF, Phoenix Group, and Prudential, utilize 2019 as the reference point for their emission reduction targets in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, as well as for their overall carbon footprint measurements. Prudential also uses 2019 as the baseline for its investment decarbonization targets and data coverage improvements. \n\nAdditionally, 2019 is the baseline year for emissions comparison and data analysis within their systems, providing a consistent reference point for evaluating progress. NatWest Group employs 2019 as the baseline year for its emissions reduction targets, and the organization uses this year to measure emissions reductions and progress toward its 2025 targets. The portfolio's initial temperature score of 2.8°C was established based on 2019 data, serving as a reference for climate risk assessment.\n\nFurthermore, 2019 marks the start of an expanded review of emissions data covering the years 2019 through 2021. It is also the baseline year for Phoenix Group's emissions measurement prior to setting reduction targets, and for GHG emissions per employee reduction targets. Prudential published its first TCFD-aligned climate disclosure and set operational climate targets for 2030 in 2019. \n\nBeyond organizational metrics, 2019 is the year associated with the GRI Tax standard and the launch of the Transition Pathway Initiative, as well as the founding of the Thinking Ahead Institute. It represents the year of baseline emissions data and initial estimates, and notably, in 2019, Phoenix Group's portfolio had 25% exposure to high transition risk sectors, with 15% of companies having approved Science-Based Targets (SBTs).", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1745691317, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_eede8f0d45", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 386, "prompt_tokens": 459, "total_tokens": 845, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
