Physical risks refer to weather events and long-term environmental impacts that can damage assets and disrupt operations, while transition risks involve policy changes, market shifts, and technological advancements aimed at addressing climate change, which can also threaten financial stability. These risks are associated with climate change impacts on financial assets, sectors, and markets, and are actively assessed and managed by organizations such as Bupa, Citi, and NatWest Group. Specifically, these risks can threaten the financial stability of these organizations and societal well-being, affecting their property assets, supply chains, and overall operations. Overall, climate-related risks pose significant challenges to financial stability and require ongoing risk management efforts across various sectors and institutions.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1745691204, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_eede8f0d45", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 169, "prompt_tokens": 309, "total_tokens": 478, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
