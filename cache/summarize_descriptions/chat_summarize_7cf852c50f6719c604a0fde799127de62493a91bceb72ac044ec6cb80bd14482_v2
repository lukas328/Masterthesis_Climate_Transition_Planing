Mizuho supports the Paris Agreement and aligns its climate strategies accordingly, integrating its principles into environmental initiatives. Similarly, Barclays and BBVA also support the Paris Agreement by aligning their financing activities and portfolios with its goals. Barclays specifically uses the PACTA methodology for decarbonization and sets climate targets and scenario choices based on the agreement's objectives.
