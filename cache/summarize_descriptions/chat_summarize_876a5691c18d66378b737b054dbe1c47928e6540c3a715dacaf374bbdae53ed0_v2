Phoenix Group has set an interim goal to reduce the carbon intensity of all assets under its control and influence by 25% by 2025, covering approximately £160 billion in assets under administration (AUA). This target is part of its broader climate strategy to decarbonize investment portfolios and operational emissions. Similarly, Allianz considers 2025 a key milestone for its emissions reduction targets and vendor commitments, indicating progress toward its climate objectives. \n\nCiti aims to have reduced its credit exposure to thermal coal mining companies by 50% by 2025 and to have developed climate-aligned steel portfolio metrics, reflecting its commitment to aligning its portfolio with climate goals. NatWest Group targets sourcing 100% renewable electricity and reducing its operational emissions by 50% from 2019 levels by 2025, demonstrating its focus on operational decarbonization. Additionally, NatWest plans for 25% of its highest-emitting suppliers to have Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)-based targets aligned with its net zero roadmap by this year.\n\nFurthermore, efforts to reduce the climate impact of assets include a target to lower the temperature score from 2.8°C to 2.6°C, covering assets such as listed equities and credit. Prudential has set a goal to establish a 2030 decarbonization target aligned with NZAOA requirements, with 2025 serving as a preparatory milestone for this longer-term objective. Overall, 2025 is recognized as a pivotal year for these organizations to advance their climate commitments, reduce emissions, and align their portfolios with net zero and climate resilience goals.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1745691276, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_8fd43718b3", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 352, "prompt_tokens": 456, "total_tokens": 808, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
