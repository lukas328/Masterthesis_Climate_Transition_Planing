Mizuho aims to be carbon neutral for Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, reflecting its commitment to operational carbon neutrality. Similarly, JLL has established 2030 as the year by which it intends to attain net-zero carbon emissions from its operations. Additionally, by 2030, there is an expectation of significant deployment of renewable energy technologies and improvements in energy efficiency, underscoring a broader industry and corporate shift towards sustainable practices and climate goals.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1745329644, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_eede8f0d45", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 170, "prompt_tokens": 257, "total_tokens": 427, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
