Organizations like Phoenix Group have implemented measures to improve residential energy performance through mortgage incentives and retrofit programs, while companies like Wincanton focus on reducing energy use in warehouses through initiatives such as LED lighting upgrades and waste reduction projects. Additionally, energy efficiency efforts include relocating to more energy-efficient buildings and adopting advanced technologies designed to lower overall energy consumption.
