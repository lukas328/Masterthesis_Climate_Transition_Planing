These emissions include those resulting from the activities financed by financial institutions, encompassing both physical and revenue-based emissions metrics. Financed emissions are inherently complex to allocate and calculate accurately due to the nature of financial activities. Specifically, Phoenix Group's financed emissions pertain to the emissions linked to its investment portfolio, which the company aims to reduce through decarbonization efforts and active engagement. Similarly, NatWest Group's financed emissions are the emissions associated with its financed activities, which it intends to lower as part of its broader climate strategy.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1745691319, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_eede8f0d45", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 132, "prompt_tokens": 256, "total_tokens": 388, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
