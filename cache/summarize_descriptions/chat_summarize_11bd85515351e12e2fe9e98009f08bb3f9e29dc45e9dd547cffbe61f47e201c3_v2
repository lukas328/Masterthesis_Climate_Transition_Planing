It is used by financial institutions such as Mizuho and BBVA to analyze transition risks and assess the implications of moving towards a low-carbon economy. The scenario assumes the implementation of strict policies and measures to reach net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050, with the primary goal of limiting global temperature rise and reducing climate-related risks. BBVA has set a specific target within this framework to achieve neutrality in its own emissions as well as in the emissions it finances by 2050, marking a significant milestone in its sustainability strategy. Overall, NET ZERO 2050 represents a critical benchmark for global efforts to combat climate change through ambitious policy action and corporate commitments.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1745329637, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_8fd43718b3", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 161, "prompt_tokens": 265, "total_tokens": 426, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
