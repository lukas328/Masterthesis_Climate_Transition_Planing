Financial institutions play a crucial role in influencing and supporting clients and portfolio companies through engagement strategies, providing feedback, and leveraging tools to achieve emissions reductions. They are responsible for integrating climate considerations into their operations, including ongoing staff training and skills assessment, to embed climate strategies effectively. These organizations provide essential banking, investment, and insurance services, and are committed to financing climate solutions, managing the phasedown of high-emission assets, and supporting sectors such as coal, oil, gas, and deforestation. By facilitating capital allocation and offering financial products, financial institutions support economic activities aligned with climate targets, including the funding of phasedown projects and climate-related disclosures, thereby actively contributing to the global effort to achieve a low-carbon, net-zero economy.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1745330151, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_8fd43718b3", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 229, "prompt_tokens": 551, "total_tokens": 780, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
