It serves as a comprehensive global framework for greenhouse gas accounting and reporting, providing guidance on measuring, managing, and verifying emissions across various organizations and sectors. The GHG Protocol is widely adopted by numerous companies and organizations worldwide, including LSEG, Bupa, Vodafone UK, and BRF, to ensure consistent and accurate emissions accounting. It covers all scopes of emissions—Scope 1 (direct emissions), Scope 2 (indirect emissions from purchased electricity), and Scope 3 (other indirect emissions)—and offers methodologies for calculating physical and economic emission intensities. The protocol also includes specific programs, such as BRF's Brazilian emissions reporting initiative, and is used by organizations to develop their carbon reporting strategies, verify emissions data, and meet regulatory or voluntary reporting requirements.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1745691144, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_eede8f0d45", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 194, "prompt_tokens": 323, "total_tokens": 517, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
