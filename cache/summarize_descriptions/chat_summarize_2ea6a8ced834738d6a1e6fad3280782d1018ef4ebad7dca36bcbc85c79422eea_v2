In the first half of 2022, New Zealand was impacted by COVID-19 closures and workforce constraints, which affected occupancy rates and staffing levels in Bupa's aged care and health services. The country served as the location for property valuations conducted by Bupa, including revaluations of its properties in 2022. Additionally, Bupa carried out employee pay compliance reviews in New Zealand and established provisions for employee entitlement underpayments.
