Various entities have committed to this goal with specific targets and initiatives. Barclays has set a goal to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, supported by its green financing and sustainability initiatives. BBVA Asset Management has also committed to reaching net zero emission portfolios by 2050. Diageo aims to achieve carbon neutrality across its operations by 2030 through measures such as renewable energy use, energy efficiency, and carbon offsetting. Johnson Matthey has established a target to reach zero operational emissions by 2040, emphasizing innovation in hydrogen, catalysis, and sustainable technologies to support decarbonization efforts. The global transition to net zero emissions is a key driver for Johnson Matthey's innovation, product development, and strategic partnerships, reflecting its focus on supporting a sustainable future through decarbonization technologies and sustainable fuels.
