Bupa's plan emphasizes integrating sustainability into its core business, focusing on health benefits, environmental impact, and establishing measurable KPIs to track progress. Similarly, LSEG's sustainability strategy, refreshed following its acquisition of Refinitiv, concentrates on accelerating the transition to net zero, enabling green economic growth, and fostering inclusive economic opportunities.
