It is the baseline year for assets under management in decarbonization targets and for cement and steel emission intensity reduction targets within Barclays' climate strategy. Additionally, 2021 marks the start year of the social initiatives supported by BBVA. In terms of financial reporting, 2021 is the year in which HSBC published its annual report, organized large-scale sustainability-linked loans, and launched climate-related products. For Barclays, 2021 was a notable year in its sustainability efforts, as the bank powered 94% of its operations with renewable electricity and achieved carbon neutrality for Scope 1, 2, and 3 business travel emissions.
