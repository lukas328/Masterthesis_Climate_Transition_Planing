BRF has a dedicated Risk Management function within its committees to oversee strategic risks and ensure compliance, supported by its Risk Management System (RMP) aligned with ISO 31000 standards for identifying, assessing, and mitigating workplace risks. Similarly, Phoenix Group has established a framework that incorporates climate-related risks into its overall risk assessment and decision-making processes, focusing on identifying, assessing, and managing these risks within its operations and investments. NatWest Group employs extensive processes and frameworks to identify, assess, monitor, and mitigate climate-related risks—covering physical, transition, and market risks—using scenario analysis, stress testing, and resilience assessments. These processes are integrated into its broader risk management strategies, which include internal climate risk reporting, enhanced frameworks, and analytic capabilities for climate scenario analysis. Citi's Risk Management department is responsible for overseeing and implementing climate risk policies, assessments, and strategies aimed at managing financial and reputational risks associated with climate change. Overall, \"RISK MANAGEMENT\" as a concept within these organizations involves a structured approach to risk identification, evaluation, and mitigation, with particular emphasis on climate-related risks, ensuring resilience and compliance across their respective operations.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1745691269, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_8fd43718b3", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 281, "prompt_tokens": 483, "total_tokens": 764, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
