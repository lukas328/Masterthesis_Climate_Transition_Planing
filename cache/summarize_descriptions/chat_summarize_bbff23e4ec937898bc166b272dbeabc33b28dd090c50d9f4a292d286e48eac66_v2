The organization provides comprehensive formulas, standards, and guidelines for calculating financed emissions, which are widely adopted and referenced by financial institutions such as Mizuho. PCAF's standards are recognized for ensuring data quality and consistency in carbon accounting within the financial industry. Mizuho has been supported by PCAF in its efforts to measure and manage its carbon footprint related to financial activities, utilizing PCAF's methodologies and standards. Additionally, PCAF's work is endorsed by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), making it a recommended framework for financial institutions aiming to accurately assess and disclose their financed emissions.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1745329637, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_8fd43718b3", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 189, "prompt_tokens": 361, "total_tokens": 550, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
