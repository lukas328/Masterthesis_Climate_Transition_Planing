It encompasses a comprehensive set of frameworks and processes implemented by financial and industrial organizations to identify, assess, and mitigate a wide range of risks, including climate-related, operational, environmental, social, regulatory, and compliance risks. For example, BBVA has established a framework for managing climate-related risks by setting decarbonization targets across sectors such as oil and gas, power, steel, cement, autos, and coal. Barclays incorporates climate-related risks into its overall risk management framework, employing processes to identify, assess, and mitigate these risks alongside other types of risks. Mizuho has developed a detailed risk management framework that involves verifying client compliance, engaging with clients annually, and responding to violations to mitigate environmental and social risks in its financing activities. This framework also includes assessing environmental and social risks in client engagements, particularly in transition risk sectors, as part of Mizuho's broader strategy to identify, quantify, and manage climate-related regulatory and transition risks. Mizuho's processes are designed to identify, assess, and mitigate both financial and environmental risks across its operations and credit portfolios, ensuring comprehensive risk oversight. Similarly, Johnson Matthey integrates risk management into its governance and strategic planning by identifying, assessing, and mitigating strategic, operational, and compliance risks, including those related to non-compliance, fraud, and operational hazards.
