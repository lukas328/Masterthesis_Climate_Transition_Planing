In mid-2021, a Sustainability Committee was formed at Bupa, comprising four Non-Executive Directors (NEDs) and the Group CEO, with the primary responsibility of overseeing Bupa’s sustainability activities, including strategy development, implementation, and monitoring of ESG performance. Similarly, within BRF, the Sustainability Committee functions as a senior management body responsible for advising the Board of Directors on animal welfare and broader sustainability issues, integrating sustainability initiatives with the company's overall business strategy, particularly focusing on the EESG agenda. This committee is tasked with disseminating ESG practices throughout BRF, reporting to the Board of Directors, and reviewing policies related to stewardship, sustainability, and ESG activities to ensure effective implementation and oversight. \n\nIn other organizations, such as Ninety One, the Sustainability Committee reviews outcomes from governance group meetings and guides sustainability initiatives, while at LSEG (London Stock Exchange Group), a committee chaired by the Chief Corporate Affairs and Marketing Officer is responsible for the strategic oversight and delivery of the company’s sustainability strategy.
