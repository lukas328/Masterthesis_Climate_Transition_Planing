The NatWest Group uses scenario analysis to assess both physical and transition risks associated with climate change, helping to inform their risk management and strategic planning. Bupa applies scenario analysis to evaluate the potential impacts of climate change under different scenarios, such as 'Late Action' and 'No Additional Action,' to assess their resilience and guide strategic decision-making. ORBIA utilizes scenario analysis to evaluate potential future climate impacts and resilience, incorporating variables such as carbon taxes and technological changes to better understand possible future conditions. The SEC is seeking clarification on disclosure requirements related to the process of scenario analysis, emphasizing its importance in transparent climate risk reporting. Overall, scenario analysis is recognized as a vital tool across these entities for understanding and preparing for the diverse risks and opportunities posed by climate change.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1745691204, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_eede8f0d45", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 175, "prompt_tokens": 280, "total_tokens": 455, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
