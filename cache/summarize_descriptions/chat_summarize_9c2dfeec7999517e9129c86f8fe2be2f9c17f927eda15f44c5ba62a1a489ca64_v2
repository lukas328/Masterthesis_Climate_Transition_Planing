This process involves assessing physical and transition risks associated with different climate futures, including scenarios such as a 2°C or lower global temperature rise. NatWest Group uses scenario analysis to examine how different climate policies, economic conditions, and physical climate impacts could affect its business, risk profile, portfolios, and financial stability. The analysis informs risk management, strategic planning, and climate risk reporting by evaluating exposure to climate-related risks and opportunities across market, pension, and conduct risks. It also assesses the resilience of the organization's transition plans against diverse climate and economic scenarios, ensuring that the bank's strategies are robust under varying future conditions. Overall, scenario analysis serves as a critical tool for NatWest Group to understand, manage, and communicate climate-related risks and opportunities, thereby supporting informed decision-making and strategic resilience in the face of climate change.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1745691317, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_eede8f0d45", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 189, "prompt_tokens": 512, "total_tokens": 701, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
