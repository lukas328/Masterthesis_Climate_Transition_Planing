Itaú Unibanco has identified power generation as a key sector targeted for decarbonization, with specific goals announced in 2023 to reduce emission intensity by 63% by 2030 and achieve Net Zero emissions by 2040 as part of its broader climate strategy. Mizuho supports the transition within this sector by promoting cleaner energy sources and implementing policies aimed at reducing reliance on fossil fuels, including coal, oil, and gas-fired power plants. Similarly, BBVA has set intermediate decarbonization targets for 2030, including phasing out coal power plants in developed countries by 2030 and globally by 2040. Overall, the power generation sector is recognized as a high transition risk area, and these financial institutions are actively managing this risk through targeted policies and ambitious emission reduction goals to facilitate the sector's shift toward low-carbon energy sources.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1745329661, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_eede8f0d45", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 214, "prompt_tokens": 354, "total_tokens": 568, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
