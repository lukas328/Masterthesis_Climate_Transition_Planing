It has historically been a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change due to its high carbon content. The coal sector is associated with significant environmental concerns, particularly its contribution to global warming, and is a focus of efforts to reduce reliance on fossil fuels. In response to climate change policies, the use of coal is declining under various climate scenarios, with a notable phasedown of coal-related activities. Financial institutions, such as BBVA, have taken steps to reduce their exposure to coal, aiming to phase out coal clients by 2030 in developed countries and by 2040 globally. The sector faces high transition and physical risks stemming from climate policies and physical climate impacts. Overall, coal remains a critical yet increasingly scrutinized resource within the natural resource sector involved in coal mining and energy production, with ongoing efforts to mitigate its environmental impact and transition towards cleaner energy sources.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1745329638, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_eede8f0d45", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 193, "prompt_tokens": 307, "total_tokens": 500, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
