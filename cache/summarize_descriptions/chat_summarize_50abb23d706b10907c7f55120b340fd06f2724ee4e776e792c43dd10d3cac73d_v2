The ongoing conflict has exacerbated challenges within the global energy markets, complicating efforts toward the transition to net-zero emissions and highlighting substantial geopolitical risks. These macroeconomic headwinds have affected various industries, including Johnson Matthey, which experienced a cessation of new sales activity and the closure of offices in Russia in 2022. Additionally, some cash and cash equivalents held by Johnson Matthey in Russia are restricted, reflecting the economic and political uncertainties associated with the country.
