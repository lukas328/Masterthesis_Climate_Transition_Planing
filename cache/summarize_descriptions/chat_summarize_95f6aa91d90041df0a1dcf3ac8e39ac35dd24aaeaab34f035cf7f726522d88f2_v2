It served as the baseline year for setting emissions reduction targets across various sectors, including Energy, which emitted 78.5 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent (MtCO2e); Power, with emissions of 320 kilograms of CO2 per megawatt-hour (kgCO2/MWh); Cement, which emitted 0.620 MtCO2e per million tonnes (Mt) of cement produced; and Steel, with emissions of 1.926 MtCO2e per million tonnes (Mt) of steel produced. Additionally, 2020 marked the year when Mizuho established its Environmental Policy aimed at addressing climate change and promoting environmental sustainability. It was also a notable year for Barclays, which made significant progress in green financing and sustainability investments, reflecting a broader commitment within the financial sector to support environmentally sustainable initiatives.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1745329645, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_eede8f0d45", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 183, "prompt_tokens": 216, "total_tokens": 399, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
