Specifically, it includes assessments performed to determine how variations in growth rates and discount rates affect the headroom of Cash Generating Units (CGUs). Additionally, it encompasses analyses showing how modifications in assumptions such as discount rates and inflation influence pension obligations and assets. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis also assesses the vulnerability of a bank's loan portfolio and related industries to climate risks by considering factors such as credit quality and maturity terms. Overall, sensitivity analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of how shifts in economic, financial, and environmental variables can impact an entity's financial position and risk profile.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1745329994, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_eede8f0d45", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 133, "prompt_tokens": 212, "total_tokens": 345, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
