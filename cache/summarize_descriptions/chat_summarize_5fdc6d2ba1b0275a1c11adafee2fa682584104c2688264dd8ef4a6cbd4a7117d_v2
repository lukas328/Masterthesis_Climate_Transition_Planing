The IEA develops various energy pathways, including the Net Zero Emissions (NZE) scenario, the Beyond 2 Degrees Scenario (B2DS), and the Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS). These pathways serve as critical frameworks for modeling climate and emissions reduction targets, informing policy decisions, and assessing transition risks. For example, the B2DS pathway is used as a basis for emissions reduction strategies, while the IEA's scenario data, such as the 1.5째C and below 2째C pathways, are utilized by organizations like Prudential to evaluate sectoral decarbonization efforts. Overall, the IEA plays a vital role in shaping global energy transition strategies and supporting efforts to meet climate goals.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1745691334, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_eede8f0d45", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 181, "prompt_tokens": 290, "total_tokens": 471, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
