These emissions include those from supply chain operations, procurement, business travel, product lifecycle, and investment portfolios. For example, Citi reports Scope 3 emissions as part of its climate disclosures, covering financed emissions from clients. Similarly, Phoenix Group aims to further reduce emissions related to supply chain and business travel. LSEG's 2021 data highlights emissions from purchased goods and services, business travel, and other indirect sources. Bupa's Scope 3 emissions, which account for approximately 98% of its total emissions, mainly originate from procurement and supply chain activities, and are targeted for reduction. NATWEST includes Scope 3 emissions from the use of paper and water within its value chain. Additionally, Scope 3 emissions include those from investment property portfolios managed by asset management partners. Overall, companies like Prudential are actively assessing and aiming to reduce Scope 3 emissions across their supply chains and investment portfolios as part of their decarbonization strategies.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1745691190, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_eede8f0d45", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 214, "prompt_tokens": 423, "total_tokens": 637, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
