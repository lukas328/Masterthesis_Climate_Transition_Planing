It is a central focus of both JLL and BBVA's sustainability strategies. JLL aims to achieve decarbonization as part of its commitment to reaching net-zero emissions by 2040, involving efforts to lower carbon footprints across its operations and supply chains. Similarly, BBVA emphasizes decarbonization as a primary goal within its broader sustainability initiatives, implementing measures such as green mortgages and renewable energy projects. BBVA's approach to decarbonization involves sectoral plans and investments in new technologies and energy efficiency measures to reduce emissions across industries, aligning with its climate strategy and commitment to sustainable development.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1745329677, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_eede8f0d45", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 157, "prompt_tokens": 290, "total_tokens": 447, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
