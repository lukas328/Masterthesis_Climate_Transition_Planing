This approach involves assessing the possible impacts of physical and transition climate risks on a company's portfolio and broader economy. For example, NatWest Group utilizes scenario analysis to gauge the potential effects of climate risks on its operations and economic environment. Similarly, Phoenix incorporates scenario analysis as a key component of its climate strategy to identify and prepare for future climate-related challenges and opportunities. Overall, approximately 48% of companies conduct strong scenario analyses to inform their climate risk management and strategic planning.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1745691363, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_8fd43718b3", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 116, "prompt_tokens": 207, "total_tokens": 323, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
