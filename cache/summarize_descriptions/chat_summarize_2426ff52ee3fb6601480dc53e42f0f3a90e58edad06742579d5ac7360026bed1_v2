It has adopted comprehensive climate laws, including a target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. The EU is actively working towards decarbonization, with specific initiatives to phase out coal-fired power generation and thermal coal power financing by 2030, including plans by financial institutions such as Barclays to cease funding for thermal coal projects within this timeframe. Additionally, the EU influences environmental standards through regulations like the EU Taxonomy regulation and climate delegated acts, which guide sustainable economic activities. To support its green policies and industrial growth, the EU has published strategic frameworks such as the Green Deal Industrial Plan, the Net Zero Act, and the Critical Raw Materials Act, all aimed at fostering a sustainable and resilient economy.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1745329723, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_eede8f0d45", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 183, "prompt_tokens": 378, "total_tokens": 561, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
