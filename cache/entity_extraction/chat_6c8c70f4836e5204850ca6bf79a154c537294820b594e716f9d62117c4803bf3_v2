The engagement of our clients may \ntake place in different manners, including by means of the \nperformance of financial operations or offer of investment \nbanking services whose targets for the progress and \naccomplishment of the transition must be monitored. If the \nclient does not reach the limits defined by 2030 or reduces \ntheir exposure to zero that year, the consequence will be the \nnon-performance of new operations due to non-compliance \nwith our phase-out policy. \n36 \nItaú Unibanco Holding S.A.climate report 2022\nOur approach to the decarbonization of \nagribusiness\nAgribusiness is a key sector for reaching the greenhouse \ngas emission reduction targets in the Brazilian context. \nIt is the second largest sector in our portfolio in exposure \nand it is likely to grow in the coming years. Due to its \nrelevance also in financed emissions, agribusiness was \none of the sectors earmarked as a priority for an in-depth \nstudy and for the definition and implementation of our \ndecarbonization strategy.\nWith the support of the consulting firm BCG, in August \n2022 we started our journey towards the structuring of the \ndata necessary for the construction and refinement of the \nbaseline of agribusiness’s emissions, as well as the definition \nof the science-based decarbonization scenario that is \nappropriate for the reality of Brazilian farming.\nIn this journey, some progress has already been made. \nChanges in the form of classification of our clients and \nattribution of specific emission factors by culture were \nmethodological improvements that have already provided us \nwith a clearer assessment of the financed emissions in the \nsector. However, for the definition of a responsible target \nand a proper decarbonization strategy, we believe that some \nadvances are still necessary, such as:\n • he access to data that we do not have yet or that we have \non a non-structured basis with respect to the practices \nadopted in the production systems of our clients, which \nwould allow us to calculate carbon removals; \n • the identification of the climate scenario that is \nmost adherent to the characteristics of the Brazilian \nproduction systems; and \n • the knowledge of emissions arising from the change \nin land use. The calculation methodologies recognized \nby science are still recent and there are few practical \napplications to be used as a benchmark for our exercise.\nRegardless of the definition and publication of our target \nfor agribusiness, we see great opportunities in the provision \nof solutions developed in partnership with our clients and \nthat help them in the transition to a low-carbon emission \nfarming activity. Promoting this transition is the central \npiece of our strategy to grow in the sector. We believe \nthat the reduction of GHG emissions linked to agribusiness \ndoes not interfere with the expansion of its activities. On \nthe contrary, the subsegments that account for most part \nof the emissions from agribusiness – livestock activity and \nmanaged soil – benefit particularly from an expressive \nincrease of production and resilience when Low-Carbon \nAgriculture (LCA) practices are adopted. Practices such as \nthe recovery of degraded pastures or the conversion of \nthese areas to crops not only reduce carbon emissions but \nalso significantly contribute to reduce the pressure for the \nopening of new areas. Also aware that the change in land \nuse is the activity that accounts for almost half of Brazilian \nemissions, we believe that compliance with environmental \nlegislation together with the fostering of practices that \nreduce emissions from the activities at the same time as they \nincrease the production capacity of areas that have already \nbeen consolidated is an intelligent strategy that contributes \nto the sustainable development of agribusiness. \nAs a partner of clients in the transition to a low-carbon \neconomy, we work on this strategy by offering them a \nstructure dedicated to the development of “green” credit \nlines for financing decarbonization initiatives in the \nagribusiness and other ESG initiatives. In partnership with \nthe Institute of Forest and Agricultural Management and \nCertification (Imaflora), we defined five priority topics for the \ncreation of these lines – low-carbon agriculture, biodiversity, \nanimal welfare, water resources and energy.  In addition \nto the creation of products that take into consideration \nsustainability aspects in their structure, Itaú BBA’s ESG \nstrategy for agribusiness also includes support for programs \nthat foster the adoption of good production practices that \ncontribute to the sustainable development of the sector.  \nOver the course of 2023, we will continue on our journey \nto classify data for refining the baseline and defining the \ndecarbonization target and we will maintain the strategy \nthat has been already adopted of growth in agribusiness, \nseeking to offer products aimed at the adoption of good \nlow-carbon emission practices in agricultural and livestock \nactivities and support programs that provide scale for the \nadoption of these practices by rural producers. \n37 \nItaú Unibanco Holding S.A.climate report 2022\nAlliances for the promotion of low-carbon emission practices in agriculture\nPart of our strategy to generate a positive impact and effectively contribute to the sustainable development of agribusiness is to establish partnerships and support programs that can \nprovide scale for the adoption\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
