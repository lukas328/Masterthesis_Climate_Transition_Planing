A key part \nof this is providing financing \nstructures for businesses that are developing \nsustainable energy.\nOne such business is electric vehicle fleet and battery \nstorage specialist . Established in 2017,  \ncurrently works with the majority of major bus \noperators in the UK, as well as local authority-owned \nbus companies, to electrify their fleets and minimise \nthe lifetime costs of their electric vehicles (EV) and \ncharging infrastructure. The company also provides \nbattery storage solutions to grid operators, \naccelerating the uptake of renewables.\nBy 2025,  aims to have a fleet of at least \n3,000 EV buses and 1GW of battery storage. \nTo support this ambition, the company has \nestablished a funding platform with an initial volume \nof £241 million, which will enable it to service and \nfinance up to 430 new e-buses in the UK and Republic \nof Ireland.\nHaving worked with NatWest Group on an innovative \nfinancing facility in 2021,  turned to our team \nagain to advise on a multi-source debt structure to \nhelp accelerate the expansion of the EV fleet sector.\nOur One Bank team, comprising colleagues from \nPrivate Placements, Specialist Asset Financing, Risk \nSolutions, ESG Advisory and Climate & ESG Capital \nMarkets, collectively delivered a bespoke funding \npackage. This incorporated green loans and private \nplacements that adhered to the Loan Market \nAssociation’s Green Loan Principles attracting \ninstitutional investors and bank lenders.\nWe believe this financing will have a real-world impact \nfor accelerating the UK’s drive to electrify its public \nroad transport system.\nCombined with ’s technical expertise, the \nfinancing enables the company to offer end-to-end \nservices to the bus operators including the design, \ninstallation, financing and operation of electrical \ncharging infrastructure and buses in the depot.\nWe believe this financing will \nhave a real-world impact for \naccelerating the UK’s drive \nto electrify its public road \ntransport system.\nThis is a clear example of our purpose in action: \nbuilding relationships with businesses such as , \nchampioning its potential and empowering it to deliver \non its sustainability ambitions. \nFunding the\ndrive to\nclean transport\nWatch the \nstory online\nThe QR code above directs to a case study video on our 2022 \nAnnual Report webpage.

To develop the initial iteration of our Climate transition plan, we have focused on sectors that provide energy used by other systems.  \nNatWest Group lending to these sectors was £5.8 billion as at 31 December 2022 (£5.7 billion as at 31 December 2021).\nSystem context:\nIn preparing the initial iteration of our Climate transition plan, we have analysed the oil and gas and electricity \ngeneration sectors. Absolute estimated emissions for these sectors was 1.6 MtCO2e as at 31 December 2021, with \nphysical emissions intensities of 2.4 tCO2e/TJ for oil and gas and 116.7 kgCO2e/MWh for electricity generation.\nThe UK CCC 2022 Progress Report estimates that emissions associated with the extraction, refining and \ndistribution of fuel supply was 8% of the UK’s emissions in 2020, with 98% of these emissions associated with the oil \nand gas industry, and 2% from coal mines. The report also estimates that emissions from electricity supply \naccounted for 11% of UK emissions in 2021.\nKey products and services to support decarbonisation:\nOil and gas\n • Credible transition plan assessment: During 2021, we concluded credible transition plan (CTP) assessments \nfor oil and gas majors and in-scope coal customers. This supported our stated ambition to stop lending and \nunderwriting to companies with more than 15% of activities related to thermal and lignite coal, unless they had \na CTP in line with the 2015 Paris Agreement in place by the end of 2021. Refer to the following page and \nsection 5.1 for the latest position. As a result of actions in this sector, lending to the oil and gas sector \nrepresents 0.7% of total lending exposure at 31 December 2022.\n • Green and transition finance: We will continue to support the transition to renewable energy and other \ntechnologies to reduce emissions in this sector as part of our climate and sustainable funding and financing.\n • Internal policies: We have continued to strengthen our ESE policies within the power generation and oil and \ngas sectors including the recent announcement to not provide reserve based lending specifically for the purpose \nof financing oil and gas exploration, extraction and production for new customers from February 2023. Refer to \npage 41 for further details on ESE policies for the power generation and oil and gas sectors \n • Specialist team to focus on energy transition:\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
