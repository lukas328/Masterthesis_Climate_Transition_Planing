A refined Responsible Supply Chain Statement which \noutlines the minimum standards that we expect from \nour suppliers across a range of ESG and Responsible \nBusiness Conduct metrics. \nIn 2022, we further refined the requirements needed \nto deliver our sustainability commitments – a robust \nprogramme of ESG focus, enhancement and \nchange. This ensures that our supply chain is aware \nof our updated expectations to allow us to work \ntogether successfully. \nThe changes within the statement include: \n▪ Required commitment from the supplier to \nsupport Bupa’s sustainability ambitions \n▪ An increased focus on all ESG topics \n▪ Encouraging annual carbon emissions reporting \nand production of a Carbon Reduction Plan \nfrom the supply chain \n▪ A focus on innovation and collaboration \nwith suppliers. \nGender pay gap \nThe gender pay gap is used across various regions \nto identify where organisations have a disparity in \nthe average pay of male and female employees. Bupa \noperates in four countries that require gender pay gap \nreporting: Australia, Chile, Spain and the UK. While the \nregulations vary slightly by location, the overall \napproach is broadly the same. \nWith most of our workforce in each location being \nmade up of women, aggregate pay gaps can be \nmisleading, masking the reality of pay levels at \ndifferent levels and in different roles. This year we \nhave reviewed the multi-year trends in the gender \npay gap for each location, however, for many reasons, \ndirect comparisons between locations are not possible \ndue to societal structures; business models, union \narrangements, and reporting methodologies. More \ngranular analyses has been conducted locally, \nproviding a more useful assessment for addressing \nareas of opportunity and defining key actions. \nIn general, our provision businesses continue to \nsee higher female representation, therefore seeing \na significant imbalance with the proportion of male \nemployees in our lower pay quartiles, thus impacting \nour Gender Pay Gap. However, we have seen an \nencouraging reduction in the gap across our health \nservices and provision businesses globally (including \nadmin and customer service). \nIn our insurance and corporate roles, our overall gender \nbalance has remained consistent to previous years with \nfewer females in the higher pay quartiles and few males \nBupa Annual Report 2022 32 \n           \n         \n         \n      \n        \n        \n         \n         \n          \n         \n        \n            \n    \n       \n     \n       \n       \n         \n        \n       \n       \n         \n       \n       \n        \n         \n      \n          \n        \n       \n         \n \n         \n        \n        \n       \n          \n       \n         \n     \n          \n         \n         \n          \n       \n        \n      \n      \n      \n         \n        \n         \n   \n        \n        \n         \n          \n  \n         \n         \n          \n          \n        \n        \n         \n         \n        \n         \n      \n      \n       \n       \n       \n      \n        \n     \n         \n        \n         \n         \n         \n        \n          \n        \n       \n       \n       \n       \n        \n        \n       \n      \n       \n       \n         \n         \n        \n       \n         \n          \n      \n         \n        \n       \n        \n          \n        \n \n          \n       \n         \n        \n         \n        \n       \n     \n          \n   \n   \nStrategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements \nSustainability and ESG continued \nin the lower. This gender imbalance at all levels of our \norganisation is a key factor in our gender pay gap. \nAcross all markets reporting, the aggregate pay gap has \nchanged little over the last three years. \n▪ APAC: There are three reporting entities in Australia: \nHealth Insurance (HI), Health Services (HS); and Bupa \nVillages and Aged Care (BVAC). Of the three reports, \nHS and BVAC have reduced the gap. HS have \nreduced by 2.5% to 41.7% but are well above industry \ncomparison of 4.4%. BVAC have reduced by 0.3% to \n2% but remain below industry comparison of 3.3%. \nHI have an increase of 2% to 21.1% but remain below \nindustry comparison of 21.7%. \n▪ ELA: In Chile, we report three categories: \nadministration and customer service, management \nand clinical. In administration and customer service, \nand management, the overall gap has declined.1 \nWomen in our provision business make up over 60% \nof our total workforce in Chile (and approximately \n80% of the provision business) making gender \nrepresentation a significant factor in the overall \nresults for this category of employee. In Spain, we \nreport across four businesses: insurance, dental, care \nhomes, and hospitals. Across all four businesses \nreporting, the aggregate pay gap has changed little \nover the last three years, with only the hospitals \nbusiness showing change. Compensation in Spain, \nfor most of our people, is covered by collective \nagreement and is therefore gender neutral by design. \nDifferentiation in pay is largely created through \nlength of service as well as the achievement of \nadditional qualifications. \n▪ BGUK: With 12 entities required to report their gender \npay gap, Bupa has aggregated the smaller entities \n(including those not required to report) into two \nbroad groups (Provision and Insurance). The current \nmedian pay gap in our provision business is 10.4% and \nour insurance and corporate category median gap \nhas increased since 2018 from 16.3% to 19.5%, both \nagainst a national average of 14.9%. \nWe are taking a range of steps to improve gender \ndiversity across Bupa and to reduce our gender pay \ngap. Some of our initiatives will deliver benefit in \nthe short to medium term, whereas others will require \nlong-term effort to drive improvement. Some actions \ntaken include the launch of reverse mentoring and \nsponsorship programmes, setting diversity targets to \ndrive local leadership accountability, and implementing \ngender balanced recruitment panels and candidate \nshortlisting for all senior roles.
