Geography for band issuance is linked to the region of the issuer; \nfor loans it is linked to the region of operation of the borrowing customer.\n(1) For the year ended 31 December 2022, the NatWest Group CSFFI criteria published \nin October 2021 has been used to determine the assets, activities and companies \nthat are eligible to be counted. For the year ended 31 December 2021, the CSFFI \ncriteria published in February 2021 was applied. The CSFFI criteria includes lending \nto personal customers for properties with EPC A and B ratings, and these were \nincluded within climate and sustainable funding and financing reporting from 1 July \n2021. NatWest Groupâs own Green, Social and Sustainability (GSS) bond issuances \nare not included in the table above. The revised CSFFI criteria published in \nDecember 2022 will be used from 1 January 2023. Full details of the CSFFI criteria \ncan be found at natwestgroup.com\n(2) Lending amounts represent total commitment and include any undrawn portion of \ncommitted credit limits.\n(3) Refer to section 5.2 for data availability and limitations related to EPC data.\n(4) Underwriting of specific use of proceeds debt capital market issuance for project \nexpenditures, as well as green loan commitments when customers meet the CSFFI \ncriteria. Amounts represent the NatWest Group share of the notional (total \nunderwriting amount lead managed or placed by NatWest Group), based on the \nnumber of underwriters within a specific deal. During the year ended 31 December \n2022 52 green bonds and private placements totalling a notional amount of \nÂ£41.6 billion (53 deals, Â£38.7 billion during full year 2021) account for c.20% of the \ntotal lead managed or placed transactions by NatWest Group during the period \n(c.16% for full year 2021). The CSFFI criteria allows for the inclusion of eligible \nsustainability bonds, which began to be included from 1 January 2022 (20 deals, \nclimate and sustainable funding and financing contribution Â£2.2 billion in the year \nended 31 December 2022).\n(5) Sustainability-Linked Loans, Bonds and private placements made to customers, in \nline with Loan Market Association (LMA) Sustainability Linked Loan principles and \nInternational Capital Market Association (ICMA) Sustainability-Linked Bond principles \nwhere deal targets include green performance indicators, aligned to CSFFI criteria.\n(6) In addition to transactions that directly meet CSFFI criteria based on use of proceeds \nfor green purposes, the CSFFI criteria also include certain general purpose loans and \nwider financing (including bonds and private placements) to a customer who can \nevidence (to NatWest Groupâs satisfaction through review of the customersâ profit \nand loss statement or balance sheet): 50% or more of revenues from the categories \nand sectors outlined in the criteria, or for fund clients 75% of assets under \nmanagement invested in assets that meet the CSFFI criteria, or for real estate and \nutilities companies 75% of their assets in categories or sectors outlined by the CSFFI \ncriteria. In the year ended 31 December 2022, the Â£1.2 billion included above \ncomprised loans of Â£1.1 billion and bonds and private placements of Â£0.1 billion.\n(7) Of the Â£17.5 billion of climate and sustainable funding and financing provided in the \nyear ended 31 December 2021, Â£8.1 billion was provided in the second half of the \nyear and therefore contributes towards the Â£100 billion target.\n(*) Within the scope of EY assurance.
