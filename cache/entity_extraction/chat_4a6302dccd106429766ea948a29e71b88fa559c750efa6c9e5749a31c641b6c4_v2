Grievance \nMechanism (GM) in which an individual or group can raise concerns, \ncomplaints, and doubts transparently and safely � In sharing \ngrievances as they arise, we can strengthen our relationship with \naffected communities and proactively engage with grievances �\nThe GM can take the form of various communication channels  \nwhich may vary depending on local customs and characteristics �  \nThe primary channel is face-to-face communication, but we also  \nuse suggestion boxes, e-mail, a toll-free telephone hotline, and \nregular meetings with affected communities �\nRoles and responsibilities for handling grievances are clearly  \ndefined between us and our customer before the project commenc -\nes� Depending on the project scope, we may be responsible for \nmanaging concerns and grievances related to the operational \nimpacts that occur during project construction, including livelihood \nissues such as dust impact, community health & safety issues such \nas road accidents, concerns about cultural heritage or customs, \nmisalignment on the expected benefits of a project, security \npractices, land compensation, and other topics �\nWhen a grievance is received, we conduct a due diligence to  \ncollect facts about the case, determine whether the grievance  \nhas merit and clarify if Vestas or any of Vestas’ contractors are \ninvolved � Where merit is established, Vestas will seek to remedy \nadverse impacts �\nThe closing timeline of a grievance will depend on each case, \nhowever, regardless of whether a complaint is accepted or not,  \na response to the stakeholder must be promptly provided in an \nunderstandable and transparent way � Vestas ensures that records \nand evidence are kept in the Vestas Incident Management  \nSystem (IMS)� \n61\nVestas Sustainability Report 2022\nSocialIn brief General GovernanceEnvironment Sustainability data Appendix\nAffected communities\n←\nIn Aquiraz, Ceara, we supported \nworkshops on preserving  \nthe traditional arts and music  \nof ancient Brazilian cultures.\nInvesting in our social license\nBuilding a sound relationship with host communities is fundamental \nto obtain and maintain a Social License to Operate (SLO) in the wind \nfarm projects to which we contribute � Unlike legal licenses or \nconstruction permits, it is not possible to apply for a social license � \nAn SLO is awarded when a project has the ongoing approval and \nacceptance of the host community and other stakeholders �\nOur global approach to the SLO helps us create financeable projects \nthrough the inclusion of social risks in our wind farm management � \nBy working continuously with our stakeholders, such as customers \nand affected communities, we aim to understand the local context \nand build trust and acceptance in our projects� We also ensure that our \nown evaluation of potential impacts, and our approach to addressing \nthese impacts, is closely aligned with our customers’ efforts �\n62\nVestas Sustainability Report 2022\nSocialIn brief General GovernanceEnvironment Sustainability data Appendix\nAffected communities\n20212020\n6,093\n14,770\n7, 97 7 7, 5 7 2\n2019

will continue to improve disclosure \naround our quantitative and qualitative human rights performance � \nTo this end, we report on the following KPIs:\n65%\n1.  The share of in-scope projects having undergone the SDD process\nWe constantly work to ensure that all projects within scope undergo \nthe Social Due Diligence (SDD) process to reach our target of 100 \npercent by 2025� This also means initiating SDD on projects that do \nnot reach firm order intake in the reporting year � \n2.  The number of community beneficiaries reached\nOur intention is to give back to the people living in the communities \nclose to our operations � Our community engagement initiatives can \nrange from providing access to jobs and stimulating local procure -\nment, to training, educational activities, and public infrastructure \nfunding � By reporting on this KPI, we evaluate the reach of the \ninitiatives in our SDD’s social management plans � \nIn 2022, we continued several of our community engagement \ninitiatives, reaching 7 ,572 direct beneficiaries �\nWith the number of beneficiaries reached in 2022, we have reached \nour 2025 target of 35,000 accumulated beneficiaries earlier than \nanticipated � Going forward, we will continue our efforts to positively \nimpact local communities and adjust our future goals accordingly �\n3. The number of community grievances received. \nWe have an Operational Grievance Mechanism (OGM) that provides \na transparent and fair way for those potentially impacted by a \nproject to raise any concerns they might have � It is an integral part of \nour approach to obtain and maintain our SLO, thereby reducing the \nrisks we face �\nIn 2022, we received 13 community grievances � To ensure we \nreceive and handle community grievances appropriatley, it is \nimportant we have a functioning operational grievance mechanism \nin place� We are pleased to see that our grievance mechanism is \nused, and will continue to revise and improve it to ensure local \ncommunities can alert us to issues as soon as they arise as outlined \nin our Human Rights Policy �\nThe number of community \nbeneficiaries reached\nThe percentage of qualifying \nprojects having undergone the \nSDD process in 2022\n7, 5 7 2\ndirect beneficiaries\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
