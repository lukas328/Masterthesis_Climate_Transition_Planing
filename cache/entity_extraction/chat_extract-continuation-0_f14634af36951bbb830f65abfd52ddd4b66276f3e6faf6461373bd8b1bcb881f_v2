Any measures \nput in place may improve or reduce the \nattractiveness and affordability of private \nhealth insurance. \n▪ All our markets have defined \nkey activities to make sure \nwe can continue to monitor \nand assess the strategic \nimplications on our businesses \nof any future changes in policy \nor regulation, and advocate \nfor appropriate change in \nthese areas. \nSocial licence The risk that \nto operate reputational damage \ncould impact our \nsocial licence to \noperate and \ntherefore our ability \nto achieve our \nstrategic objectives. \n▪ Like many global companies, we face an \nincreased risk of stakeholder activism and \ngreater scrutiny of our record as a socially \nresponsible company on topics such as the \nenvironment and climate change and other \nissues which can be interpreted as having \na ‘ethical’ dimension, e.g. executive and/or \nlow pay, Inclusion and Diversity, treatment \nof suppliers, governance, responsible \ninvestment.
