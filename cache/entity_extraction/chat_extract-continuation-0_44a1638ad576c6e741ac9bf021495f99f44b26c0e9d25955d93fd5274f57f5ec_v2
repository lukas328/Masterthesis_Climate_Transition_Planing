and\n• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements \nof the Companies Act 2006.\nWe have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual Report and Accounts \n(the “Annual Report”), which comprise: the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position \nand Parent Company Statement of Financial Position as at 31 March 2023; the Consolidated \nIncome Statement and Consolidated Statement of Total Comprehensive Income, the \nConsolidated Statement of Cash Flows, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity \nand Parent Company Statement of Changes in Equity for the year then ended; and the notes \nto the financial statements, which include a description of the significant accounting policies.\nOur opinion is consistent with our reporting to the Audit Committee.\nBasis for opinion\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) \n(“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described \nin the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. \nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide \na basis for our opinion.\nIndependence\nWe remained independent of the group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are \nrelevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical \nStandard, as applicable to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical \nresponsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\nTo the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non‑audit services prohibited by the \nFRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided.\nOther than those disclosed in note 4, we have provided no non‑audit services to the company \nor its controlled undertakings in the period under audit.\nOur audit approach\nOverview\nAudit scope\n• We conducted a full scope audit or specified procedures at 32 business units which together \naccount for 83% of group revenue and 71% of group underlying profit before tax from \ncontinuing operations.\n• We maintained regular contact with our component teams and evaluated the outcome \nof their audit work.\nKey audit matters\n• Refinery metal accounting (group and parent)\n• Carrying value of goodwill (group and parent)\n• Uncertain tax provisions (group and parent)\n• Claims, uncertainties and other provisions (group and parent)\nMateriality\n• Overall group materiality: £21.1 million (2022: £21.8 million) based on approximately \n5% of the three year average profit before tax from continuing operations, adjusted \nfor loss on disposal of businesses, gains and losses on significant legal proceedings, major \nimpairment and restructuring charges.\n• Overall company materiality: £60 million (2022: £60 million) based on 1% of total assets. \nHowever the materiality is capped at £20 million (2021: £20 million) for the purpose \nof the audit of the consolidated financial statements, this being the maximum allocation \nof group materiality to a component.\n• Performance materiality: £15.8 million (2022: £16.3 million) (group) and £15 million \n(2022: £15 million) (company).\nThe scope of our audit\nAs part of designing our audit, we determined materiality
