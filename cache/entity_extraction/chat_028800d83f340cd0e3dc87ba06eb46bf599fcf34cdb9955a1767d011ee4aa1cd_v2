Measurement of financed emissions based on PCAF \nIndirect GHG emissions from financing and investment (financed emissions) occupy the largest share of financial institutions ’ \nScope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. In our view, initiatives towards measuring, monitoring, and reducing these emissions are crucial.
