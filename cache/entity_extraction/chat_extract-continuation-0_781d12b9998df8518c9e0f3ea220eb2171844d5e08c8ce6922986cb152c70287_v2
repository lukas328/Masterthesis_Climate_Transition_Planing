In \nlate 2021, the Board approved a proposal to establish \nMarket Unit Advisory Oversight Committees (AOCs) \nto the CEOs of ELA and BGUK to provide advice \nand enhance oversight across those Market Units, \nparticularly in relation to provision businesses where \nthere are no non-executive directors serving on the \nboards of those subsidiaries, and given that the \ncorporate structure of both Market Units means that \nthere is no single holding company board that could \nprovide non-executive director oversight. In early 2022, \nthe Committee considered and approved proposals for \nthe non-executive membership of the ELA and BGUK \nAOCs. The remit of the AOCs will be refined over time \nand their effectiveness monitored by the Committee. \nAs Paul Evans and Matías Rodríguez Inciarte are a non-\nexecutive member and chair of the BGUK and ELA \nAOCs respectively, there is an open channel of \ncommunication between the AOCs and the Board. The \nCommittee determined that an AOC is not required for \nthe APAC Market Unit as its corporate structure gives \nthe boards of its holding companies good oversight \nof the majority of the Market Unit. \nThe results of the annual evaluations of the boards \nof our main regulated insurance subsidiaries are \nconsidered by the Committee. These evaluations \nhave reported that each subsidiary board continued \nto operate effectively. \nThe Committee also approved a number of \nappointments and re-appointments of non-executive \ndirectors to subsidiary boards during the year. \nRestoring trust in audit and corporate governance \nThe Committee received an update on the proposals \nfrom the UK Government and the FRC on restoring \ntrust in audit and corporate governance and Bupa’s \nproposed approach to the requirements. It was noted \nthat some of the proposals would be mandatory and \nothers could be adopted on a voluntary basis in view \nof Bupa’s corporate status. Given the nature of the \nproposals, the Audit Committee is leading on \nconsidering the proposals. Bupa will finalise its \napproach as more detail and certainty around the \nrequirements emerges.

In early \n2022, the Committee considered whether to appoint \nBoardroom Review, who conducted the previous review \nin 2019, or to undertake a formal process to identify an \nalternative provider. The Committee considered that \nthere was value to be gained from using the same \nprovider due to its prior knowledge of Bupa and ability \nto assess progress on the recommendations made \npreviously. Therefore, the Committee appointed \nBoardroom Review to facilitate the 2022 Board and \nCommittee evaluation process. In line with emerging \nbest practice in the field of board evaluation, the \nCommittee would not consider Boardroom Review for \nthe next externally facilitated evaluation of the Board. \nThe Committee delegated approval of the scope of the \nreview to a sub-committee comprising the Chairman, \nGroup CEO, Paul Evans (as SID-elect at that point) and \nthe Group Company Secretary. The agreed themes for \nthe review of the Board and Committees included: \n▪ Their engagement with and oversight of the new \nstrategy, purpose and performance \n▪ How well future risks and opportunities to the \nbusiness are assessed \n▪ Oversight of finance, audit, risk management, \ncontrols and operational resilience and effectiveness \nof the three lines \n▪ Engagement with stakeholders. \nIn relation to the Directors, Boardroom Review \nwas asked to consider the roles, relationships and \ncontributions of the Directors and the blend of \ndynamics, diversity of perspective and quality of debate \nand decision-making. Dr Tracy Long of Boardroom \nReview observed meetings of the Board and each \nCommittee in late 2022 and interviewed each Director, \nthe Group Company Secretary, the CRO and the Chief \nSustainability and People Officer. \nAn initial meeting to discuss the findings was held with \nRoger Davis prior to the report being shared with the \nfull Board for discussion in February 2023. The agreed \noutcomes for the Board are set out in the Leadership \nsection on page 56.
