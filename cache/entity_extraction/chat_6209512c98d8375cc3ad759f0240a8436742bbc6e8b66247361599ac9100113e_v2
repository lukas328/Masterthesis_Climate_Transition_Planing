This was an interactive session that focused on current \nand emerging climate-related topics, including climate-related \nissues within emerging markets, evolving regulatory and disclosure \nrequirements, increasing stakeholder expectations, and climate-\nrelated opportunities. As part of the preparation for this session, \nmaterials were made available to the Board from Chapter Zero, \nof which our Chair and Chair of the GRC are members. \nDuring the year, we also conducted a range of formal and informal \nclimate-related education and engagement sessions for employees \nacross our business. We sought to build awareness with employee \nactivities such as Climate Week, where we posted interviews with \nsenior team members working in climate-related roles. A number of \nour businesses have also rolled out climate and ESG training modules. \nWe are cognisant of the link between climate change and mental \nhealth, and believe it is important to empower our employees with \naccess to climate-related training, information and broader mental \nhealth support systems.\nWe aim to foster a culture where our employees live our values: to \nbe ambitious, curious, empathetic, courageous, and nimble. This is \ncritical for setting our organisation up for success, both for our own \njourney towards net zero, and the external transformation which the \nglobal economy is undergoing. More information on our culture can \nbe found in the Building social capital section of the 2022 ESG Report. \nRecognising the interconnectivity of climate change to other \nmacro-issues, Prudential seeks to link our response to climate change \nto other important social topics, which are important to many of our \ninternal and external stakeholders, as described in table 1. \nTable 1: Considering Prudential’s stakeholders \nStakeholder Considerations\nCustomers We seek to identify where climate change and the transition to a low carbon economy may impact access to health and \nfinancial security, and seek to address these impacts to support our customers.  \nCommunities We are conscious of what the potentially catastrophic impacts of climate change may mean for our communities in Asia \nand Africa. We are also aware that activities typically involved in transitioning towards a low carbon economy, such as \ndivestment from higher carbon-emitting assets, can come with unintended consequences, such as exacerbating existing \nsocio-economic imbalances.\nEmployees It is critical that our employees feel adequately supported, personally and professionally, during both the short- \nand long-term transition process. Empowering employees to become climate literate, promoting training and work \nopportunities, and fostering a culture of transparency and accountability is crucial during this process.\nInvestors As part of our fiduciary duty, we must balance the investment strategies and opportunities that meet the long-term needs \nof our investors, while considering the potential risks and opportunities that may be relevant for us. Further information on \nour climate-related risk and opportunity identification and management can be found within our TCFD disclosure in our \n2022 ESG Report.\nGovernments  \nand regulators\nWe regularly engage with regulators and monitor climate-related initiatives that could develop into new regulations \nor requirements in the markets where we operate. We seek to mainstream the voice of emerging markets within our \ndiscussions, and support the development of localised frameworks that assist decarbonisation initiatives within individual \njurisdictions. We engage actively with the stock exchanges in our markets to adopt consistent and internationally \ncompatible ESG disclosures.\nGovernance / continued\n  Incentives and remuneration      \nAn important element of aligning our business activities and \nvalue proposition with the transition towards net zero is through \nour remuneration and incentives, both short and long term. \nShort term: In recent years, the Group’s Executive Directors have \nhad a strategic priority, which is included in their Annual Incentive \nPlan, to drive the climate and responsible investment focus across \nthe organisation, both as an asset owner and an asset manager, \nthrough embedding the external ESG commitments made in \nMay 2021.\nLong term: In late 2021, the Remuneration Committee decided \nthat a measure aligned with our published commitment to \nreduce the carbon emissions of all shareholder and policyholder \nassets by 25 per cent by 2025 should be attached to Executive \nDirectors’ 2022 Prudential Long Term Incentive Plan (PLTIP) \nawards. Carbon reduction targets will also be attached to \nExecutive Directors’ 2023 PLTIP awards.\n20\nPrudential plc Climate Transition Plan prudentialplc.com\nMethodology\nFor a full outline of the scope, reporting boundary and assessment \nmethodology for climate-related metrics, in particular carbon \nemissions and WACI, see Prudential’s 2022 Basis of Reporting \ndocument.   \nAdditional assumptions\n> Our targets have been set based on our current Group structure \nand excludes assets of our joint ventures. Were this to materially \nchange, we would consider revising our targets in line with the \nNZAOA target setting protocol. \n> We use industry protocols and methodologies, such as the \nPartnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) and TCFD, \nfor target setting.
