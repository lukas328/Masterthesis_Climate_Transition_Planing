There are more than 4,500 people in the \ncommunity who will have easier, and more sustainable access \nto clean water when the project is completed. The terrain \nin the village makes it a difficult area to undertake such a \nproject. But we have confirmation of successful drilling in the \nvillage, yielding 1.5 litres of water per second. \nThis is our third solar-powered water infrastructure project in \nSouth Africa. A number of other areas have been identified \nfor similar support. The principle adopted is to prioritise \nareas where this type of intervention could catalyse more \neconomic activity. \n\nLinewu Mukutwana receiving news of passing Matric with \nMthandwa Sincuba, Bulungula College Principal, January 2024.\nSustainability and Stewardship Report\n77\nBulungula Incubator\nNinety One continued its support of the Bulungula Incubator, a non-profit \norganisation that aims to alleviate poverty in one of the poorest districts \nin South Africa, supporting more than 5,000 community members. The \nfounders have worked tirelessly with the community and local government \nofficials to provide basic infrastructure and resources to the community. \nThey now stand as a model for creating vibrant, sustainable rural livelihoods. \nThe legacy of apartheid still prevents many in the rural areas of the \nEastern Cape from accessing quality education. Since its establishment \nin 2019, Bulungula College has been a beacon of hope for many \nlearners in the area. The college achieved a 97% pass rate for its 2023 \nGrade 12 class. The vast majority of the learners are the first in their \nfamilies to finish high school.\nOne example of this journey is Linewu Mukutwana, the top-performing \nstudent in the class of 2023. When Bulungula Incubator first met her, \nshe was living with her family in a dilapidated mud hut. Against the odds, \nLinewu has emerged as a shining star, receiving five distinctions in her \nmatric results. She is now in the Changeblazers programme.\nSongo.info\nSongo.info is a community-based organisation that has humble \nbeginnings: from founder and former mountain biking world champion \nChristoph Sauser’s dream of providing a safe space for children to \nplay on bikes, the programme has evolved into a sports and academic \nsupport programme equipping the children of Kayamandi, a poverty-\nridden township near Stellenbosch in South Africa, with the skills to \nlead a successful life. Ninety One’s partnership with Songo started \nin 2015 and has enabled the educational programme to flourish. The \norganisation currently supports 100 beneficiaries. \nOur employees have become increasingly involved with the Songo \nteam and its beneficiaries, as can be seen in the pictures below.\nSustainability and Stewardship Report\n78\nEmployee-driven initiatives \nOver the financial year, we continued to support the efforts of staff and amplify \ntheir contributions to causes that are close to their hearts. Via our charity matching \nprogramme, we have provided support to more than 40 staff-selected charities \nglobally. We have noted that staff volunteerism at different offices continues to grow. \nWe are seeing this come through in volunteering to work with young people as well \nas through initiatives like winter blanket-making and working at soup kitchens. \nSchool shoe drive by staff for iKhaya le \nThemba in Imizamo Yethu, South Africa\nA Ninety One employee-led motivational day held \nat Sunridge High School, which included provision \nof study material and motivational speakers\nThe Bookery\nWe expanded our partnership with The Bookery, a literacy charity in \nSouth Africa that provides under-resourced schools with well-stocked \nlibraries, efficient library management systems and trained library \nassistants. We funded our third library project with The Bookery and \nmore than 1,228 learners and 39 educators at Diepdale Secondary \nSchool in Soweto will now have a well-stocked library for the first time. \nThis is the 95th library that The Bookery has launched.\nAppendix 1\nActing as a corporate citizen\nAppendix 2\nGlobal stewardship codes\nAppendix 3\nSignificant votes\nAppendix 4\nEngagement list\nAppendix 5\nAdvocacy initiatives\nAppendix 6\nPrinciples for Responsible Investing\n79\nSustainability and Stewardship Report\nAppendices\n80\nSustainability and Stewardship Report\nAppendix 1  \nActing as a corporate citizen\nNinety One has a number of policies to ensure we operate in a socially \nresponsible and compliant manner, reflecting our value of doing the \nright thing.\nOur approach to anti-bribery and anti-corruption \nWe have a zero-tolerance approach to bribery and corruption.

Regional \ncompliance teams are responsible for reviewing and updating internal policies \nto enable our business and employees to manage the legal and reputational \nrisks associated with bribery and corruption.
