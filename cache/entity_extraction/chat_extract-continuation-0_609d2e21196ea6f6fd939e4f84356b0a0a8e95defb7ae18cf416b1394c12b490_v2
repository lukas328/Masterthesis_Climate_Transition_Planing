In order to deliver \ntransition finance with rigor and accountability, \nGFANZ introduces ten components, arranged \nunder five themes, of credible net-zero \ntransition plans. Each component comprises a \nrecommendation, guidance, case studies, and \nexamples. The report also identifies possible areas \nfor further work that financial market participants \nshould consider as the sector advances its \ntransition planning efforts.\nGFANZ aims to accelerate adoption of current \nbest practices (recognizing that these will \ninevitably change) and promote consistency in the \ndevelopment and use of transition plans across \nthe financial sector. We have included illustrative \nexamples from individual institutions representing \nefforts to address one or more elements of the \nguidance for specific components. These are not \nintended to represent “best practice” nor represent \nthe entirety of guidance for a component. 38 Instead, \nthe examples are included because they may help \nfinancial institutions interpret individual elements of \nthe guidance for their own practices.\nGFANZ is grateful to our partners, the sector-\nspecific net-zero alliances, and to the wide range \nof organizations that have developed detailed \nguidance and other resources in the area of \ntransition planning and on which this report is based.\nCONTENTS  |  FINANCIAL INSTITUTION NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLANS — FUNDAMENTALS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND GUIDANCE\n5\nBOX 1.
