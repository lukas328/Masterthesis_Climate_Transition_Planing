Such obstacles include, for example, poor , inconsistent and delayed \ndata as well as less developed regulatory schemes for the monitoring and reporting of emissions. \nThis challenge is compounded by the lack of global regulatory and policy alignment on climate \nand other sustainability matters. Finally, developing countries often have more limited capacity \nto transition due to unequal and challenged access to climate finance. They also frequently lack \nthe investment capital necessary to fund adaptation and mitigation solutions, including renewable \nenergy and technology-driven clean energy alternatives.\nChallenges regarding the availability and quality of climate-related data are more evident as we set targets \nfor additional sectors, given the disparity of data quality and quantity across different sectors. Given our \nreliance on data that is based on estimated or unverified figures, precision is difficult, and this creates \nchallenges for many of our climate-related activities, from scenario analysis to tracking progress towards \nour financed emissions targets. However , as the availability and quality of data improves, we will review and \nupdate our Net Zero Plan and remain as transparent as possible with respect to this evolving landscape.\nCurrent geopolitical events have underscored the fact that the energy transition is unlikely to be smooth \nand linear . The Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 resulted in volatile energy markets and \nwidespread focus on energy security concerns and reliance on fossil fuels. At Citi, as our clients respond \nto the current energy market, we understand that our transition plans may need to adapt to accommodate \nenergy security and access to energy needs, while also facilitating the transition to clean energy. For \nexample, actions aimed at ensuring global energy supply could mean the financed emissions footprint in \nour portfolio may grow before it shrinks. Our net zero strategy prioritizes the focus we place on creating a \nresponsible transition, and addressing these needs is not mutually exclusive. \nTCFD REPORT 2022: CITI’S APPROACH TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND NET ZERO | 39\nWe continue to consider and integrate climate-related matters into our overarching risk management \nframework and processes and, to that end, collect and analyze relevant data to support this effort. Over \nthe past year , Citi has continued to develop tools to assess climate risk and engage our clients with respect \nto climate risk and transition plans. We have also continued building risk identification, management and \nscenario analysis capabilities.\n Climate Risk Management Framework   \nThis year , we concluded the development of our Climate Risk Management Framework (CRMF). The CRMF \nis designed to promote a globally consistent approach to managing climate risk across Citi. The CRMF \ndetails the governance, roles and responsibilities and principles to support the identification, measurement, \nmonitoring, controlling and reporting of climate risks. The CRMF is progressively being embedded into \nbusiness-as-usual risk management processes across the bank as well as relevant policies and standards. It \nis expected the CRMF will evolve over time to reflect new tools and processes as well as industry standards \nand best practices in climate risk management. \nRefining Risk Identification and Understanding Risk Exposure   \nCiti continues to enhance its focus on climate risk driven by the increasing significance of strategic, \nreputational and financial risk considerations, including embedding these considerations into Citi’s \noverarching risk management approach. \nCiti continues to view climate risk as a crosscutting risk under our Enterprise Risk Management Framework, \nwhich can manifest in each of the risk categories in our risk taxonomy. Citi will continue to review this risk \ndesignation as we develop our climate risk management approach. The table below indicates the impacts \nthat climate risk drivers can have on our key risk categories. \nCiti has developed an internal risk identification process in which it quarterly evaluates its top risks, which \nare defined as risks that have the potential to produce an impact large enough to threaten Citi’s ability to \nmaintain any of its core operations to serve its customers, Citi’s earnings, liquidity, capital, or operating \nmodel, or Citigroup’s or Citibank NA’s risk profile. Climate risk was recently designated as a top risk through \nthis process. In light of the variable nature of this process, however , we may not report on this internal \nclassification on a forward basis but will continue to enhance our disclosure on how we manage our risk \nand the areas that present the most significant climate risk in future TCFD reports.\n \nRisk Management \n \nPART 4\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CITI<|><organization<|>Citi is a global financial institution actively developing and implementing climate risk management strategies, including tools for assessing climate risk and engaging clients on transition plans.
