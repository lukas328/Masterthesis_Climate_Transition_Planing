We evaluate our clients’ identification \nand preservation of high conservation areas (including peatlands and high carbon stock forests) and \nimplementation of best practice fire prevention to avoid causes of deforestation.\nIn early 2023 Citi updated its ESRM Policy to incorporate additional sector-specific requirements for clients \nactive in soy and beef production in or sourcing from sensitive ecoregions of Latin America. Soy clients \nthat are identified as producing in or sourcing from the above ecoregions will be reviewed for membership \nand certification with the Roundtable on Responsible Soy (RTRS). Beef clients that are identified as \nproducing in or sourcing from the above ecoregions will be reviewed for clear policies and management \nplans that demonstrate commitments to 100% traceability of their supply chain in sensitive ecoregions, in \nalignment with the Accountability Framework — a toolkit based on international norms and industry best \npractice for companies to prevent deforestation driven by the production of agricultural commodities, \nincluding livestock, in their operations and supply chains.\nClimate-Related Data   \nOne of the many challenges Citi and other companies face in developing and implementing net zero \nplans concerns the availability and quality of data, both of which present major limitations. Although it \nis necessary for us to utilize imperfect information in the implementation of our Net Zero Plan, given \nthe urgency of climate change, we continue to advance our data improvement work with the intention of \nincorporating additional insights from such data and analyses as they become available. \nClimate Data Utility   \nOne aspect of our data improvement work is to build an internal, central data hub of climate-related \ndata. As part of our firmwide climate strategy, the central data hub will support various needs across our \nbusinesses, such as climate stress testing, PCAF calculations and credit risk processes. To aid our efforts, \nTCFD REPORT 2022: CITI’S APPROACH TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND NET ZERO | 33\nwe utilize software that connects to an external transition risk model and a data assimilation tool that \nincludes data from a range of leading vendors. \nAdditionally, Citi has developed a broader “ESG Insight Platform,” which is a database of over 6,000 \npublic companies’ ESG profiles, aggregated from third-party data providers, designed to make robust and \nconsistent data available across the firm. \nData Governance   \nCiti is implementing a number of data governance processes to support our retail and corporate \nbusinesses. These are being led by various working groups, including the Climate Data and Analytics \nWorking Group. This group brings together colleagues from across the firm who have business \nrequirements or responsibilities for climate data and analytics and serves as a forum to share ideas \nor collaborate on these issues. The CGDI team provides the Working Group with regular updates on \nthe developments of our climate data hub design, data sourcing for sectors in the context of financed \nemissions calculations, as well as transition risk and physical risk model vendor evaluations. The CGDI team \nalso owns the primary data governance of all inbound and ingested environmental data, and this is guided \nby the enterprise-wide data standards.\nClimate Policy and Regulatory Engagement   \nConstructive engagement with the public sector is one of our Net Zero Transition Principles, as we know \nthat achieving net zero will also require public policy and technology solutions. We continue to engage \nwith regulators and policymakers — locally, nationally and internationally — to further efforts regarding \nclimate policy and regulation. In 2022, Citi’s climate-related engagement priorities in the U.S. included \nthe SEC proposed climate disclosure rule, for which Citi submitted a comment letter to the SEC (see page \n36), the tax incentives for climate solutions included in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation \nReduction Act; proposed principles for the risk management of climate-related financial risks issued by \nthe Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) and by U.S. regulators, for which Citi submitted a \ncomment letter to the BCBS; and global harmonization of climate-related disclosure regulation. Citi is also \na member of trade and business associations that may lobby on different issues, including climate change, \nbut these associations do not necessarily not necessarily represent Citi’s positions on every issue. Below is \na summary of certain trade and business associations that Citi is a member of, and how Citi has engaged \nwith them on climate-related issues.\n34 | TCFD REPORT 2022: CITI’S APPROACH TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND NET ZERO\nCLIMATE-RELATED ENGAGEMENT WITH TRADE ASSOCIATIONS\nTrade  \nAssociation About Climate Change Position\nAreas of Influence  \nand Alignment \nBusiness \nRoundtable \n(BRT)\nA non-profit association, \nmembers of which are the \nCEOs of major U.S. companies \nworking to promote a thriving \neconomy in the U.S. and \nexpanding opportunity for \nall Americans through public \npolicy.\nPromotes policies to ensure \nsustainable, reliable and \naffordable energy while \naddressing climate change \nand maintaining a healthy \nenvironment.
