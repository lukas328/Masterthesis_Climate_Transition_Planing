The \nresults of our scenario analysis carried out to date \nsuggest that our strategy is resilient to the financial \nrisks from climate change. We continue to evolve and \nmature our climate scenario analysis along with our \ndisclosure approach and scan for developments and \nimprovements in scenario methodology and data. \nThe following section sets out some of the key \nhighlights from tests performed to date. \nClimate Biennial Exploratory Scenario (CBES) scenarios \n- Bupa has utilised two scenarios from the PRA’s CBES \n(although Bupa was not formally invited to participate) \nto help explore the possible impacts to the Group \nbalance sheet from climate change over a 30-year \nhorizon: ‘Late Action’: a ~2oC, disorderly transition \nscenario, achieving net zero by 2050 (comparable to \nthe Network for Greening the Finance System (NGFS) \nDisorderly scenario); and ‘No Additional Action’, a \n4.1oC scenario with high physical risk due to a lack of \ntransition (comparable to the NGFS Hot House World \nand the Representative Scenario Pathway (RCP) 8.5 \nscenarios). We have tailored some of the provided \nproperty valuation shock parameters to ensure \nrelevance for our specialist property portfolio (e.g. care \nhomes, retirement villages, and hospitals) based on the \nimpacts of increased physical risk (e.g. floods), across \nmultiple territories, using publicly available third-party \ndata sources where available, and additional internal \njudgements. The scenarios also include a shock for \nproperty adaptation costs and increased insurance \npremiums across the entire property portfolio, as well \nas an assessment of the impacts on our investment \nportfolio and the value of Bupa’s debt. \nOther scenarios - Our 2022 Stress and Scenario Testing \nprogramme helped us to better understand localised \nclimate change risks as well as a range of potential \nimpacts which could be driven by climate change \n(although not exclusively) over the following 12-month \nperiod. For example: Global scenarios; impacts of \nincreased inflation on insurance claims and expenses \nacross all businesses (possibly a potential outcome of \nan energy price shock and/or carbon pricing). Local (i.e. \nBusiness Unit) scenarios: impacts of strategic workforce \nrisks (including workforce shortages, increased attrition, \nand higher staff costs), supply chain disruption risk, and \nregulatory changes. \nIn 2023, new analysis will be piloted to help provide \ninsights into how climate change could affect the \nprevalence and severity of certain health conditions, \nand how this might impact the frequency and average \ncosts of health insurance claims (and therefore \nprofitability). The analysis could help us understand \nhow Bupa’s health insurance offering might need to \nadapt to meet changing customer needs and identify \nnew opportunities. \nBupa Annual Report 2022 48 \n  \n   \n \n   \n    \n   \n   \n     \n    \n   \n   \n          \n   \nStrategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements \nIn this section \nGovernance \n50 Chairman’s governance statement \n51 Leadership \n59 Board of Directors \n63 Bupa’s system of governance \n67 Audit Committee report \n73 Risk Committee report \n76 Nomination & Governance Committee report \n79 Board Sustainability Committee report \n82 Directors’ remuneration report \n97 Other statutory information \nBupa Annual Report 2022 49\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BUPA<|><organization<|>Bupa is a global healthcare group involved in health insurance, aged care, and health services, performing scenario analysis and risk management related to climate change impacts>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLIMATE-RELATED GUIDANCE WORKING GROUP<|><organization<|>The Climate-related Guidance Working Group has published the Care Home Heatwave Guide in 2022 to share best practices internationally for managing climate-related health risks>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CARE HOME HEATWAVE GUIDE<|><event<|>A guide published in 2022 by the Climate-related Guidance Working Group to provide guidance on managing heatwave risks in care homes>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BRITISH POUND (GBP)<|><geo<|>The GBP is the currency used in the UK, mentioned in context of pricing controls and economic impacts))\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NGFS<|><organization<|>Network for Greening the Financial System, an international network of central banks and supervisors working on climate risk assessment and scenario analysis>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRA<|><organization<|>Prudential Regulation Authority, a UK financial regulatory body involved in climate scenario analysis and stress testing))\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FLOODS<|><event<|>Physical climate risk event impacting property and infrastructure, considered in scenario analysis>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NET ZERO<|><event<|>A target scenario where global emissions are reduced to net zero by 2050, referenced in climate transition scenarios>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RCP 8.5<|><event<|>A high-emission scenario used in climate modeling, representing a \"Hot House\" world with high physical risks>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DISORDERLY TRANSITION<|><event<|>A climate transition scenario where net zero is achieved by 2050 in a disorderly manner, associated with ~2°C warming>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PHYSICAL RISK<|><event<|>Risks associated with physical climate impacts such as floods, heatwaves, and sea-level rise, affecting property and health services>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLIMATE CHANGE<|><event<|>Global environmental change impacting weather patterns, health, and economic systems, central to the scenario analyses and risk assessments>)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLIMATE-RELATED GUIDANCE WORKING GROUP<|>CARE HOME HEATWAVE GUIDE<|>The Working Group published the guide in 2022 to share best practices for heatwave management<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BUPA<|>CLIMATE-RELATED GUIDANCE WORKING GROUP<|>Bupa is involved in climate risk assessment and scenario analysis as part of its strategic response<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BUPA<|>PHYSICAL RISK<|>Bupa's scenario analysis includes physical risks like floods and heatwaves impacting its properties and health services<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BUPA<|>NET ZERO<|>Bupa is exploring scenarios like net zero by 2050 to assess climate transition risks<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BUPA<|>RCP 8.5<|>Bupa uses high-emission scenarios like RCP 8.5 in its climate impact assessments<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLIMATE CHANGE<|>PHYSICAL RISK<|>Climate change causes physical risks such as floods and heatwaves that impact Bupa's operations<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLIMATE CHANGE<|>EVENT<|>Climate change is the overarching event influencing physical risks, policy, and economic impacts discussed in the report<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
