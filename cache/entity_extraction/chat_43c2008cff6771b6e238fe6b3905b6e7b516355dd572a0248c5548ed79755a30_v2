Guides are \naccessible explaining how each incentive plan operates to ensure full understanding. \nClarity \n▪ There is clear alignment between the performance of the Company and the rewards. Proportionality \n▪ Incentive elements are closely aligned with our strategic goals, transparent and robustly assessed, \nwith the Committee having full discretion to adjust outcomes to ensure that they align with overall \nBupa performance. \n▪ The Group’s remuneration arrangements are intentionally simple in nature and well understood. \nExecutive Directors (and senior leadership) receive fixed pay (salary, benefits, pension), and \nparticipate in a short-term incentive (the MBS) and a long-term incentive (the SPP). \nSimplicity \n▪ The Committee reviews the appropriateness of targets annually, being mindful of alignment \nwith strategy and keeping them simple. \n▪ This structure provides clear line of sight for both executives and is well understood. \n▪ MBS and SPP are focused on rewarding performance against key measures of success \nfor the business. \n▪ Our reward structure ensures that risk events are reflected in remuneration outcomes. \nOpinion from Risk on events and behaviours are considered before awards are made. \nRisk \n▪ The Committee also considers that the Policy provides wide-ranging flexibility to adjust payments \nwhere outcomes are not considered to reflect underlying business performance and individual \ncontributions, or where behaviours are inconsistent with the risk appetite of the Group. \n▪ Deferral of MBS (over three years) and SPP (three-year performance period), subject to malus \nand clawback provisions mitigates against future risk. \nPredictability ▪ At the time of approving the Policy full information on the potential values of the MBS and SPP \nis provided, with strict maximum opportunities alongside minimum, on-target and maximum \nperformance scenarios. \nAlignment with \nculture \n▪ \n▪ \nWe are committed to effective stakeholder and colleague engagement. \nAs part of this, the Committee regularly reviews data and insights relating to pay and broader \nemployment conditions in the workforce and takes these into account when considering executive \nremuneration. \nOur executive remuneration at a glance \nThe chart above is representative of the implementation of the Directors’ Remuneration Policy and represents the \ntotal received in the year by each Executive.
