In accordance \nwith Section 409 of the Companies Act 2006, a full list of subsidiaries, associated undertakings and significant \nholdings in undertakings other than subsidiaries, the registered addresses and the effective percentage of equity \nowned, as at 31 December 2022, is disclosed after the Company financial statements. \nD. Post-employment benefits \nThe Company operates defined benefit schemes and a defined contribution pension scheme for the benefit \nof employees and Directors, in addition to an unfunded pension scheme and a post-retirement medical \nbenefit scheme. \nThe main defined benefit scheme is The Bupa Pension Scheme which has been closed to new entrants since \n1 October 2002 and closed to future accrual since 31 December 2020. Following the closure of this scheme to \nfuture accrual, existing members retain any ongoing salary link, with future benefits payable dependent upon \nmember salary at the date of leaving or retirement. Any current employees who were members of The Bupa \nPension Scheme were automatically enrolled into a defined contribution scheme, the My Bupa LifeSight Plan, \nfrom 1 January 2021. \nThe recognised surplus in relation to The Bupa Pension Scheme is limited to the present value of any future refunds \nfrom the scheme in the event of a wind up. There are no minimum funding requirements in place and the Trustees \ndo not have the unilateral power to trigger a wind up of the Scheme. Once all members have left the scheme, the \nCompany can wind up the scheme and is entitled to any remaining surplus. \nDuring the year, deficit reduction contributions of £1m were paid and further deficit reduction contributions of \n£1m per annum are due for 2023 and 2024, in respect of the smaller defined benefit scheme. \nThe Company is the sponsoring employer for The Bupa Pension Scheme, the unfunded pension scheme and post-\nretirement medical benefit scheme described in Note 7.1. The actuarial assumptions underlying the valuation of \nobligations are detailed in Note 7.2. \n(i) Assets and liabilities of schemes \nThe assets and liabilities in respect of the defined benefit funded pension scheme, unfunded pension scheme \nand post-retirement medical benefit scheme are as follows: \nPost-retirement medical \nPension schemes benefit scheme Total \n2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021 \nNote £m £m £m £m £m £m \nPresent value of funded obligations (ii) (1,109) (1,887) – – (1,109) (1,887) \nFair value of plan assets (iii) 1,512 2,425 – – 1,512 2,425 \nNet assets of funded schemes 403 538 – – 403 538 \nPresent value of unfunded obligations (ii) (39) (51) (4) (6) (43) (57) \nNet recognised assets/(liabilities) 364 487 (4) (6) 360 481 \nRepresented on the Statement of Financial Position: \nNet assets 404 541 \nNet liabilities (44) (60) \nNet recognised assets 360 481 \nBupa Annual Report 2022 202 \n      \n            \n \n \n  \n \n               \n               \n                  \n      \n            \n      \n            \n             \n               \n      \n           \n \n       \n     \n         \n      \n     \n     \n       \n            \n \n      \n     \n    \n     \n     \n    \n        \n                   \n                 \n \n                \n                    \n      \n          \n \n         \n     \n           \n          \n     \n   \nStrategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements \nFinancial Statements of the Company continued \n(ii) Present value of the schemes’ obligations \nThe movements in the present value of funded and unfunded schemes’ obligations are: \nPost-retirement medical \nPension schemes benefit scheme Total \n2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021 \n£m £m £m £m £m £m \nAt beginning of year 1,938 1,997 6 8 1,944 2,005 \nInterest on obligations 35 29 – – 35 29 \nGain arising from changes to financial assumptions (784) (10) (1) – (785) (10) \nLoss/(gain) arising from changes to experience \nassumptions 21 (22) – (2) 21 (24) \n(Gain)/loss arising from changes to demographic \nassumptions (2) 10 – – (2) 10 \nBenefits paid (60) (66) (1) – (61) (66) \nAt end of year 1,148 1,938 4 6 1,152 1,944 \n(iii) Fair value of funded schemes' assets: \nThe movements in the fair value of the funded schemes' assets are: \n2022 2021 \n£m £m \nAt beginning of year 2,425 2,487 \nInterest income 43 36 \nReturn on assets excluding interest income (897) (33) \nContributions by employer 1 – \nAdministration expenses (2) (2) \nBenefits paid (58) (63) \nAt end of year 1,512 2,425 \nThe market value of the assets of the funded schemes are as follows: \n2022 2021 \n£m £m \nPooled investment funds 616 1,174 \nCorporate bonds 511 803 \nLoans 189 164 \nCash/other assets 154 130 \nGovernment bonds 75 140 \nDerivatives (33) 14 \nTotal market value\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
