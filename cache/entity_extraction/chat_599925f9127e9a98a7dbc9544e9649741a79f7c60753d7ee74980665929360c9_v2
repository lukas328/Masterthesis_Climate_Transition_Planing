In accordance \nwith Section 409 of the Companies Act 2006, a full list of subsidiaries, associated undertakings and significant \nholdings in undertakings other than subsidiaries, the registered addresses and the effective percentage of equity \nowned, as at 31 December 2022, is disclosed after the Company financial statements. \nD. Post-employment benefits \nThe Company operates defined benefit schemes and a defined contribution pension scheme for the benefit \nof employees and Directors, in addition to an unfunded pension scheme and a post-retirement medical \nbenefit scheme. \nThe main defined benefit scheme is The Bupa Pension Scheme which has been closed to new entrants since \n1 October 2002 and closed to future accrual since 31 December 2020. Following the closure of this scheme to \nfuture accrual, existing members retain any ongoing salary link, with future benefits payable dependent upon \nmember salary at the date of leaving or retirement. Any current employees who were members of The Bupa \nPension Scheme were automatically enrolled into a defined contribution scheme, the My Bupa LifeSight Plan, \nfrom 1 January 2021. \nThe recognised surplus in relation to The Bupa Pension Scheme is limited to the present value of any future refunds \nfrom the scheme in the event of a wind up. There are no minimum funding requirements in place and the Trustees \ndo not have the unilateral power to trigger a wind up of the Scheme. Once all members have left the scheme, the \nCompany can wind up the scheme and is entitled to any remaining surplus. \nDuring the year, deficit reduction contributions of Â£1m were paid and further deficit reduction contributions of \nÂ£1m per annum are due for 2023 and 2024, in respect of the smaller defined benefit scheme. \nThe Company is the sponsoring employer for The Bupa Pension Scheme, the unfunded pension scheme and post-\nretirement medical benefit scheme described in Note 7.1.
