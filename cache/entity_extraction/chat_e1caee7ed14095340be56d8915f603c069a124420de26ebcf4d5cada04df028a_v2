training on waste management, \nand has a series of procedures for the control and \nmanagement of its waste, amongst which are stand-\nardized tools and procedures included in the Operational \nExcellence System (OES), in the ‘More Excellence’ program, \nand in the company’s own regulatory documents, which \ncover the industrial, administrative, logistics and farming \noperations.\nThe Solid Waste Management Plans and the Health \nServices Plans of each unit outline the processes which \nensure that the packaging, separation, collection, \nscreening, storage, transportation and disposal of the \nwaste generated are always in compliance with the \nlegislation and good practices established in the internal \nprograms and regulations. \nIn 2022, BRF improved its management of waste data, \nestablished new indicators and targets (related to the \ngeneration, cost efficiency and disposal of waste), and is \nin the process of implementing a computerized waste \nmanagement system to streamline the processes and \nenable online monitoring of the information which will \nthus provide support in defining the Company's strategic \nactions. These include reducing waste disposed of in \nlandfills and aggregating value to byproducts that could \nserve as inputs in other internal or outsourced processes.\nThis management meant that, in 2022, as well as the sale \nof byproducts, more than 78% of BRF’s waste was diverted \nfrom final disposal and directed to composting and other \nrecovery operations in licensed companies. This allowed \nthese materials to be reintroduced into the production \nchain, adding new value to those materials already \nremoved from nature.\nThe third party waste transportation and disposal \n1,310.74\n474,551.77 \n475,862.51 Total generated waste\nHazardous waste\nNon-hazardous\nWaste by category1 – 2022 (t) GRI 306-3\n¹ BRF does not nominally publish information on its waste or types of waste, since this is strategic information \nthat could provide details on its operations\nservice providers undergo a rigorous documentation \nand technical ratification process, including an annual \nin-person audit, and constant monitoring of the \ndocuments relevant to this activity, thereby reducing the \nrisks inherent to the process and ensuring the correct \ndisposal of the waste in accordance with the Company's \ndirectives and commitments.\n \nWaste GRI 306-4\nWaste diverted from \ndisposal (t)  \nGRI 306-4 \nWaste directed to disposal (t)  \nGRI 306-5 \nHazardous waste 239.12 1,071.62\nNon-hazardous  371,755.25   102,796.52  \nTotal wasteTotal waste 371,994.37 371,994.37 103,868.14 103,868.14 \n110\nValue Generation5\nOur way of \ndoing business\nOur strategy\nCulture and \nEngagement\nIndicators  \nand annex\n3\n4\n6\n2\nPresentation1\n2022 Integrated  \nReport\ncompliance with the constraints of the environmental \nlicensing processes. In relation to 2021, there was an \nincrease of 6,835,146 tons and, of this total, around \n2,684,189 related to the generation of manure in the \nproduction of breeding sows, which was not accounted in \n2021.\nWe generally treat pig manure in anaerobic pools, \nfollowed by fertigation on farmlands, in line with a ferti-\nlization plan guided by an expert technician. The poultry \nbedding, meanwhile, is temporarily stored allowing it \nto ferment, with a view to eliminating pathogens and \nmineralization. The material is then used as an organic \nbiofertilizer in farming processes. We recommend and \nencourage our producers to use the manure as an \norganic fertilizer , as part of an agronomic project, taking \ninto consideration the characteristics of the waste, soil \nand crop being grown.\nWe are committed to making 100% of our packaging \nrecyclable, reusable and biodegradable by 2025. Through \nour R&D department, we optimize and study alternatives \nthat pose no risk to the consumer’s health and safety \nin order to minimize the unnecessary generation of \nmaterial for post-consumption disposal. Another area in \nwhich we have moved forward in recent years has been \nthe reduction of grammage and the adoption of alter-\nnative materials designed to preserve the stability of the \nproducts.\nAnimal litter and manure generated   SASB FB-MP-\n160A.1\nIn 2022, the amount of animal litter and manure\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
