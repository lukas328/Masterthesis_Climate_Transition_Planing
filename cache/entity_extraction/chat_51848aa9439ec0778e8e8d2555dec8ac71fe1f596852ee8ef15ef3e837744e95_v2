The resolution of tax positions taken by the \ngroup can take a considerable period of time to conclude and, in some cases, it is difficult to \npredict the outcome. Group current income tax liabilities at 31st March 2023 of £106 million \n(2022: £97 million) include tax provisions of £97 million (2022: £103 million) and the \nestimation of the range of possible outcomes is an increase in those liabilities by £66 million \n(2022: £83 million) to a decrease of £55 million (2022: £93 million).  The estimates made \nreflect where the group faces routine tax audits or is in ongoing disputes with tax authorities; \nhas identified potential tax exposures relating to transfer pricing; or is contesting the tax \ndeductibility of certain business costs. \nDeferred tax assets \nDeferred tax assets are recognised to the extent it is probable that future taxable profits will be \navailable, against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilised, based on \nmanagement’s assumptions relating to future taxable profits. \nDetermination of future taxable profits requires application of judgement and estimates, \nincluding: market share, expected changes to selling prices, product profitability, precious \nmetal prices and other direct input costs, based on management’s expectations of future \nchanges in the markets using external sources of information where appropriate. The \nestimates take account of the inherent uncertainties, constraining the expected level of profit \nas appropriate. Changes in these estimates will affect future profits and therefore the \nrecoverability of the deferred tax assets. \nRefining process and stocktakes \nThe group’s and parent company’s refining businesses process significant quantities of \nprecious metal and there are uncertainties regarding the actual amount of metal in the \nrefining system at any one time. The group’s refining businesses process over four million \nounces of platinum group metals per annum with a market value of around £6 billion. The \nmajority of metal processed is owned by customers and the group and parent company must \nreturn pre-agreed quantities of refined metal based on assays of starting materials and other \ncontractual arrangements, such as the timing of the return of metal. The group and parent \ncompany calculate the profits or losses of their refining operations based on estimates, \nincluding the extent to which process losses are expected during refining. The risk of \nprocess losses or stock take gains depends on the nature of the starting material being \nrefined, the specific refining processes applied, the efficiency of those processes and the \ncontractual arrangements.  \nStocktakes are performed to determine the volume and value of metal within the refining \nsystem compared with the calculated estimates, with the variance being a profit or a loss. \nStocktakes are, therefore, a key control in the assessment of the accuracy of the profit or loss \nof refining operations. Whilst refining is a complex, large-scale industrial process, the group \nand parent company have appropriate processes and controls over the movement of material \nin their refineries. \nNotes on the Accounts continued for the year ended 31st March 2023 \n157 \n1 Accounting policies continued \nSources of estimation uncertainty continued \nClimate change \nThe impact of climate change presented in the group’s Strategic Report (see pages 45 to 52) \nand the stated net zero targets have been considered in preparing the group accounts.  \nThe following considerations were made: \nImpact on the going concern period and viability of the group over the next three years. \nThe latest forecasts reflect the continuous investment in sustainable technologies including \ncommercialisation of our products used in green hydrogen production and higher \nperformance fuel cell components for a range of automotive, non-automotive and \nstationary applications. \nThe potential impact of climate change on a number of areas within the financial statements \nhas been considered, including: \n• The forecasts of cash flows used in impairment assessments for the carrying value of non-\ncurrent assets including goodwill (see note 5). \n• Recoverability of deferred tax assets. \n• The expected lives of fixed assets and their exposure to the physical risk posed by \nclimate change. \nThe expected lives of property, plant and equipment tends to be short to medium term, as \nsuch the physical risk posed by climate change in the long term is low. \nAssets held for sale \nOur estimate for the fair value less costs to sell of the Battery Materials business (£15 million) \nis based on third party valuations and our agreement with EV Metals Group plc. \nJudgements made in applying accounting policies \nMetal \nThe group and parent company use precious metal owned by customers in their production \nprocesses. It has been determined that this metal is not controlled by the group or parent \ncompany and, therefore, it is not recognised on the balance sheet.  \nThe group and parent company manage precious metal inventories by entering into physically \nsettled forward sales and purchases of metal positions in line with a well-established hedging \npolicy. The own use exemption has been adopted for these transactions and, therefore, the \ngroup and parent company do not fair value such physically settled contracts. \nThe group undertakes linked contracts to sell or buy precious metal and commits to \nrepurchase or sell the metal in the future to manage inventory levels. Accordingly, cash flows \nin respect of sale and repurchase agreements are shown as cash flows from operating \nactivities in the cash flow statement rather than cash flows from financing activities. \nProvisions and contingent liabilities \nThe group is involved in various disputes and claims which arise from time to time in the \ncourse of its business including, for example, in relation to commercial matters, product \nquality or liability, employee matters and tax audits. The group is also involved from time to \ntime in the course\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
