As a first step towards achieving our targets, we will proceed with gradually shifting our power contrac ts in \nJapan to renewable energy, giving priority to our large- scale contract properties. Furthermore, regardi ng properties that a group \ncompany occupies as a tenant, we will aim to shift power contracts to those that are in effect using renewable energy options by \napproaching the topic with the owner. At the same time, we will consider the introduct ion of corporate p ower purchase \nagreements.13 \n \nWe will also continue to consider methods that can directly reduce Scope 1 emissions, such as the adoption of electric vehicles. \n \nWhile a number of our offices outside of Japan are already making use of renewable energy, we will press forward with the shift \nto renewable energy using available methods in accordance with the local conditions at each individual office. \n \nTable 3: Progress towards achieving our Scope 1 and 2 targets and our policy going forward  \nProgress Policy going forward \nSwitch to renewable energy \n• Considering how to make use of renewable energy  \nin order to revise targets. \n• Adopting renewable energy at some offices in Japan. \n• Switching to renewable energy at some offices  \nin Europe. \nIn Japan \nHandling Scope 2 emissions (Switch to renewable \nenergy) \n• Gradually shift our power contracts in Japan to \nrenewable energy. \n• In cases where Mizuho is a tenant and has not entered \ndirectly into a power contract, approach owners about \nshifting power contracts to renewable energy. \n• Consider / implement corporate power purchase \nagreements. \nHandling Scope 1 emissions (Switch to electric vehicles \n(EVs)) \n• Consider adoption of EVs. \nOutside of Japan \n• Promote shift to renewable energy using available \nmethods in accordance with the circumstances at each \ndepartment, branch, and office. \n \n                                         \n12 Mizuho Financial Group, Mizuho
