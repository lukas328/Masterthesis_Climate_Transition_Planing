reducing the impact of our facilities and our operations. \nAs part of our Net Zero Plan, we have committed to achieving net zero operational emissions by 2030. \nAs part of this commitment, we are prioritizing the reduction of emissions from our operations as much \nas possible, although we acknowledge that some emissions offsetting will likely be necessary for hard-to-\nabate operational emissions. Carbon capture and sequestration technology still remains largely limited and \ncostly. There is also a need to scale the deployment of existing energy efficient and renewable technologies \nto support the protection of the environment beyond our value chain. In support of this need, Citi will begin \nto purchase voluntary third-party verified carbon credits consisting of a portfolio of nature-based, energy \nefficiency, and methane destruction credits in an amount equivalent to our Scope 1 direct GHG emissions. \nWe plan to rebalance the carbon credit portfolio mix to only use removal credits as we near our 2030 \noperational target. \nWe have been tracking, reporting and reducing emissions for over two decades. In 2020, we introduced the \nfourth generation of operational footprint goals for 2021 to 2025. These goals, which form the foundation \nof our net-zero operations commitment, seek to reduce not just our emissions but also our energy, water \nand waste consumption and impacts across our operations. Progress on our first year of reporting toward \nthese new goals is provided below. Please note that, as a result of having fewer people using Citi buildings \ndue to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, our progress for 2021 indicates that we exceeded some of our \ngoals during the year . That trend could briefly reverse in the coming years as our employees continue to \nreturn to the office, before progressing again toward meeting our goals. \nTCFD REPORT 2022: CITI’S APPROACH TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND NET ZERO | 61\n 2025 OPERATIONAL FOOTPRINT GOALS  \n(MEASURED AGAINST 2010 BASELINE)\n \n* 91% sourced within the same market boundary as use; 9% sourced from regionally aligned markets. \n** 2021 total includes 14 Excellence in Design for Greater Efficiencies (EDGE) projects in Latin America.  \n \nProgress  \nthrough 2021Category Goal\n45%\nreduction in location-based  \nGHG emissions 49.8%GHG EMISSIONS\n40% reduction in energy consumption 37.9%\n100% maintain renewable electricity sourcing 100%*ENERGY\n30% reduction in total water consumption 38.8%\n25%\nof water consumed to come from \nreclaimed/reused sources 7.0%\nWATER\n50% reduction in total waste 55.8%\n50% of waste diverted from landfill 22.8%\nWASTE\n40%\nof floor area to be LEED,  \nWELL or equivalent certified 34.7%**SUSTAINABLE \nBUILDINGS\n62 | TCFD REPORT 2022: CITI’S APPROACH TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND NET ZERO\nFor more information on our work to meet these goals, please see the “Sustainable Operations” section of \nour 2021 Environmental, Social and Governance Report.
