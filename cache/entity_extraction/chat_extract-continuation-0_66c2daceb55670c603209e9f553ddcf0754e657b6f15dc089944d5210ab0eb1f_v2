This has put significant pressure on the risk environment and \ncompanies’ financial reporting processes. Accordingly, we have continued to focus on \nfinancial reporting and related internal control risks as well as ensuring the company \nmaintains a strong performance on ethics, compliance and audit quality.  \nThe focus of assurance activities during the year has been post Covid-19 controls’ culture \nacross the group’s locations and key strategic and emerging risks. In this context, \na comprehensive improvement programme across JM’s financial and operational controls, \nincluding raising awareness and simplifying requirements, has been established and is \nsponsored by the Group’s Chief Financial Officer. Within Group Assurance and Risk (GAR) \na new form of site extended audit covers several core processes based on an assessment of \nrisk, to provide assurance on the control environment and framework at site level. These \ntypically cover design and effectiveness of operating controls, including Internal Controls \nfor Financial Reporting (ICFR), metal controls, procurement, ethics and compliance, business \ncontinuity planning, security, and technology controls. It has been important to validate these \ncontrols following the return to site post Covid-19 pandemic and to respond to new risks \noccurring at unprecedented speeds and various pressures on our entities. These audits also \nprovide insight on the culture found at the site.\nFlexibility of our assurance plans has proven helpful during the year, especially in the context \nof emerging risks in the fast-moving external environment. The GAR team has been providing \nlive assurance as part of various business-led task forces, such as JM’s energy resilience in response \nto the conflict in the Ukraine. Specific focus has been dedicated to our sustainability agenda, \nan area of increasing importance from an assurance perspective. Our internal audit activity has \nbeen focused on driving improvements in quality of the data and management reviews.\nAudit Committee report\n“ The Committee’s work \nprovides a focus to ensure \nrobust controls support \nthe execution of our \ngroup strategy”\nMembership\nThe Audit Committee comprises all independent non-executive directors. Doug Webb, \nour Committee Chair, is a chartered accountant who brings a wealth of recent and \nrelevant financial experience, including acting as Chief Financial Officer at the London \nStock Exchange Group, QinetiQ and Meggitt.\n  Members’ attendance at committee meetings during the year is on page 75.\nOther regular attendees at committee meetings\n• Chair of the Board\n• Chief Executive Officer\n• Chief Financial Officer\n• General Counsel and Company Secretary\n• Group Assurance and Risk Director\n• Director of Group Finance\n• PwC Audit Partner\n  The Committee’s Terms of Reference set out its full responsibilities.  \nmatthey.com/governance-framework\nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 202394\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION\nDuring the year, we looked at the anticipated impact and readiness of our internal controls \nfinancial reporting framework and fraud risk management programme. We examined these \nfactors in relation to the recommendations of the Department for Business, Energy and \nIndustrial Strategy (BEIS) white paper on restoring trust in audit and corporate governance. \nThe position paper issued by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) in July 2022 proposed that \nthe revised UK Corporate Governance Code will apply on or after 1st January 2024. For us this \nwill apply to the financial year ending 31st March 2025. With ongoing work to strengthen our \ninternal control environment and address additional reporting requirements, we concluded \nthat existing procedures, our in-progress work on controls and other areas of change, would \nmeet evolving corporate governance requirements. We await additional clarification on some \nrequirements, and these are subject to ongoing monitoring by group and business \nmanagement.\nTo address the anticipated changes, the outcome of our review on the key changes and \nimpact for JM is as follows:\n• Statement on internal controls – substantial work has been carried out over recent years \nto improve JM’s overall control environment and provide sufficient evidence that controls \nare operating effectively, using JMProtect, our integrated governance, risk and compliance \nplatform\n• Resilience Statement – updated requirements are expected to be substantially covered \nby work already performed to support the existing disclosures in the  Viability Statement \non page 70\n• Dividends and capital maintenance – existing disclosures will be reviewed once guidance \nis available from the FRC\n• Audit and Assurance Policy (AAP) – the Committee approved an internal policy drafted by \nthe GAR team, with cross-functional support. Committee reviews began at the end of 2022 \nand take account of guidance from the FRC\n• Fraud Statement – an assessment of fraud risks, current detection, and prevention \nmechanisms, reporting and documentation of associated controls was completed in 2022. \nFraud training for JM’s extended finance community began in 2022. A regular governance \nmechanism was established via monthly Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) \ncommittee meetings. A fraud risk policy will be incorporated into the AAP, and fully \nintegrated into JMProtect.\nThe Committee also reviewed the key changes and impact for JM of the new requirements \nfor auditors and the regulator. We will assess this area in more detail once the FRC issues \nmore guidance.\nIn 2022, the group refreshed its sustainability goals and 2030 targets. ESG data in annual \nreports is coming under increasing scrutiny as the investor community relies on it to evaluate \nthe value proposition of listed companies. We are conscious of the need for transparency, \naccuracy and the avoidance of overstating our performance in these measures.
