Some jurisdictions such as the US, \nEU and Japan reach net zero for all GHGs. The scenario assumes medium (as opposed to \nlow) use of CDR technology.\nIPR Forecast Policy \nResponse (FPS)\nOffers a high conviction forecast of likely policy developments and is designed to reflect \n‘real world’ climate policies. The Paris ‘ratchet’ mechanism and increasing societal \npressure converge between 2023 and 2025, and force governments to take meaningful \nclimate action. Temperature rise is limited to 1.8°C by 2100. IPR scenarios fully integrate \nland-use modelling.\nRequired Policy \nResponse (‘RPS’)\nMore stringent climate scenario than FPS and includes additional policies required to \nlimit temperature rise to 1.5°C. RPS carbon prices are similar to FPS levels. Additional \ndecarbonisation is driven by performance standards (bans) and direct subsidies. RPS \nentails deeper decarbonisation from emerging low-carbon technologies than FPS, \nincluding greater levels of carbon capture and storage.\nPhoenix \nGroup\nCovid-bounce Bespoke scenario that allows for a change from the recent emissions trajectory following \nre-opening of world economy post-Covid and the response to the energy crisis.\n2\n27\nPhoenix Group Holdings plc Net Zero Transition Plan\nInvest Engage Lead\nEmbedding net zero \nin our business\nBecoming a \nnet zero business Measuring our progress\nExecutive \nsummary\n Plan the journey continued \nScenario analysis and modelling continued\nOur emissions pathway projection \ntool indicates that our projected \nfinanced emissions vary considerably \nacross different economy-wide \ndecarbonisation scenarios\nThe action required to hit our targets will vary \nwidely in different climate scenarios\nWe modelled the potential effects on our financed \nemissions of the nine economy-wide \ndecarbonisation scenarios described on the \nprevious page. As shown in figure 15, these \nscenarios span a considerable range of \nexpectations. At one end, our bespoke ‘Covid \nbounce’ scenario assumes a slight increase in \nemissions in the near term before reductions and \nthe NGFS ‘Current Policies’ scenario assumes \nminimal incremental economy-wide progress \non emissions reductions beyond current policies. \nBoth scenarios see only modest reductions in our \nfinanced emissions to 2030, which would make \nmeeting our targets difficult.\nAt the other end of the range, the NGFS ‘Net Zero \n2050’ and ‘Divergent Net Zero’ scenarios and the \nIPR’s ‘Required Policy Response’s scenarios all \nshow ambitious and rapid economy-wide emissions \nreductions driven by a significant ratcheting of \nambition. These scenarios translate into significant \nreductions in our financed emissions, which  \nwould aid us in achieving our targets.\nThe range of plausible potential economy-wide \nemissions reduction scenarios and their widely \nvarying impacts on our financed emissions \nhighlight the high levels of unavoidable  \nuncertainty we are operating in. Our approach  \nto implementing our Net Zero Transition Plan \nneeds to reflect this uncertainty, and we will \ncontinue to use and refine our emissions pathway \nprojection tool to inform future planning.\nOur modelling is based on a wide range of \nassumptions and limitations, including assuming a \nstatic balance sheet that does not reflect strategic \nasset allocation throughout the period to 2050. \nTherefore, actual outcomes may vary considerably \nfrom those modelled to date.\nIn addition, our interim targets are intensity rather \nthan absolute-based and therefore are impacted \nby variation in asset prices.\nFigure 15: Financed emissions projections under different \ndecarbonisation pathway scenarios prior to our management actions\nThe modelled scenarios demonstrate a wide range of uncertainty on future decarbonisation \ntrajectories that will impact our achievement of our net zero goals.
