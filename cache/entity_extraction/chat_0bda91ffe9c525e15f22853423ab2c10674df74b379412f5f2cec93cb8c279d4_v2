GFANZ is \nproviding recommendations and guidance in this \nframework for financial institutions to assess their \nexisting business activities with a lens of climate \nand emissions reduction as a significant driver. \nActivities include all aspects of the financial sector, \nincluding redirecting capital, providing net zero-\naligned financial products and services, working \nwith real-economy firms as they develop and \nimplement ambitious and credible strategies and \nactivities for the transition, and engaging with \npolicymakers to create an enabling environment for \nthese changes.\nClimate solutions:  Technologies, services, \ntools, or social and behavioral changes that \ndirectly contribute to the elimination, removal, \nor reduction of real-economy GHG emissions \nor that directly support the expansion of these \nsolutions. These solutions include scaling up \nzero-carbon alternatives to high-emitting \nactivities — a prerequisite to phasing out high-\nemitting assets — as well as nature-based \nsolutions and carbon removal technologies. 40\nActions taken by financial institutions to \ndecarbonize their portfolios and businesses \nmay not drive real-world decarbonization; for \nexample, reducing financed emissions by selling \nthe high-emitting assets in a portfolio 41 or ending \nexisting business with high-emitting firms does \nnot necessarily decrease global GHG emissions, \nas buyers or new providers of capital may not be \ncommitted to net-zero goals.42 Financial institutions \nshould consider the potential for real-economy \nemissions reduction in their activities, recognizing \nthat the greatest emissions reduction may be \nachieved by directing financing and related services \nto — rather than divesting from — firms and assets \nthat need to transition. In other words, financial \ninstitutions should focus not only on reducing \ntheir financed emissions , but also on financing \nemissions reduction . GFANZ believes that such an \napproach to transition finance is essential to driving \nthe real-economy transition.\nGFANZ has identified four key financing strategies \nthat define transition finance. These strategies \n(shown on the next page) are inclusive of financing, \ninvestment, insurance, and related products and \nservices that are critical to delivering real-economy \nemissions reduction in support of an orderly, net-\nzero transition of the global economy:  \nCONTENTS  |  FINANCIAL INSTITUTION NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLANS — FUNDAMENTALS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND GUIDANCE\n9\n1. Climate solutions: Financing or enabling entities \nand activities that develop and scale climate \nsolutions. This strategy encourages the expansion \nof low-emitting technologies and services, including \nnature-based solutions, to replace high-emitting \ntechnologies or services, remove greenhouse gases \nfrom the atmosphere, or otherwise accelerate the \nnet-zero transition in a just manner. An example may \nbe a company that produces green hydrogen or a \nproject on regenerative agriculture.\n2. Aligned: Financing or enabling entities that are \nalready aligned to a 1.5 degrees C pathway. This \nstrategy supports climate leaders and signals that \nthe financial sector is seeking transition alignment \nbehavior from the real-economy companies with \nwhich it does business.43 An example may be a \ncompany with an SBTi-validated target and whose \nprogress reports demonstrate achievement against \nthe target or a company whose climate transition \nplan and performance is assessed by the World \nBenchmarking Alliance.\n3. Aligning: Financing or enabling entities \ncommitted to transitioning in line with 1.5 degrees \nC-aligned pathways. This strategy supports both \nhigh-emitting and low-emitting firms that have \nrobust net-zero transition plans,44 set targets \naligned to sectoral pathways,45 and implement \nchanges in their business to deliver on their net-\nzero targets. An example may be a manufacturer \nwho is implementing energy efficiency and \nclean energy projects to reduce its Scope 1 \nand 2 emissions or a retailer engaging with its \nsupply chain to invest in Scope 3 emissions \nreduction projects.\n43 Financial institutions could use emissions disclosures, portfolio alignment metrics, and transition plans for assessing alignment, \nas well as third-party verification programs where available. Financial institutions should be transparent about the methodologies \nand data they are using to determine alignment while industry standards are still maturing. Note that while the pool of already-\naligned companies is currently small, it is expected to grow as the transition progresses.\n44 GFANZ. Expectations for Real-economy Transition Plans , 2022.\n45 GFANZ. Guidance on Use of Sectoral Pathways for Financial Institutions , 2022.\n46 Please see The Managed Phaseout of High-emitting Assets , 2022, by GFANZ for a discussion on the need for an identification \nframework for eligible assets.\n47 IPCC’s AR6 cites the “combined global discounted value of the unburned fossil fuels and stranded fossil fuel infrastructure has \nbeen projected to be around 1-4 trillion dollars from 2015 to 2050 to limit global warming to approximately 2 degree C, and it will \nbe higher if global warming is limited to approximately 1.5 degrees C.” p. 36 –37.\n4. Managed phaseout: Financing or enabling the \naccelerated managed phaseout (e.g., via early \nretirement) of high-emitting physical assets. 46 \nThis strategy facilitates significant emissions \nreduction by the identification and planned early \nretirement of assets while managing critical issues \nof service continuity and\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
