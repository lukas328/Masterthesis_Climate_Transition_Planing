The \ndirection of the portfolio takes into consideration the \ndiversification of risks and the efficient use of the \nbalance, in line with our decarbonization objectives \nand targets, which are monitored with diligence \nand transparency.\nNBZA recommends that, 18 months after the adherence to \nthe commitment, the banks should disclose their first sector \nemission reduction targets. We chose to begin this journey \nwith the Power Generation and Thermal Coal industries. \nSince 2022 credit operations for Oil & Gas in the Arctic and in \ntar sands are prohibited*.\nAs recommended by NZBA, we will have the challenge \nof defining and publishing intermediary targets for the \nother priority industries in the coming months, as well as \nthe respective transition plans. The major goal is to reach \nNet Zero by 2050 with a trajectory that is in line with the \nParis Agreement.\nDefinition of the \nbaseline of the sector \ndecarbonization \ntargets \nWe will align our \nstrategy with the:\n •  Reduction of 63% in the \nintensity of emissions \nfrom the power \ngeneration portfolio \nby 2030, reaching \nNet Zero by 2040.\n •    Phase-out of the \nThermal Coal \nsector by 2030.\nBy promoting the transition of our business, we create opportunities and reduce \nthe impact of climate change on our portfolio and society.\nWe incorporate climate change as a central element of the \nbusiness strategy, always focused on supporting the climate \ntransition of our clients. We established our first sector \nemission reduction targets, with structured timeframes, \nwhile monitoring and listening to clients and companies \nfrom the priority industries. The plan will be reviewed \nperiodically to incorporate the evolution of the knowledge of \nclimate change, always in line with science. \nOur climate transition plan is based on the essential tripod \nof support for innovation, direction of the loan portfolio \nand engagement of clients, observing the technological and \neconomic momentum of each sector and geographic region. \nThe definition of any target necessarily goes through the \nknowledge of the baseline of the GHG emissions. Since 2021, \nwe have been reporting our financed emissions and the \nresults of which are presented in the Metrics and Targets \nsection of this report.\n*Applicable to Infrastructue Finance and Project Finance - no new projects or expansion of existing projects for unconventional Oil & Gas in the Arctic and in Tar Sands. \n30 \nItaú Unibanco Holding S.A.climate report 2022\nDefinition of the baseline of our financed emissions\nIn the process of defining the baseline and our sector emission reduction targets, we carry out a coordinated effort with the participation of experts from the different structures of the \norganization with the support of the consulting firm BCG. \nApplication of the PCAF methodology\nThe Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials \n(PCAF) applies the attribution principle used by the \nGHG Protocol in which the financed emissions are \ncalculated based on the attribution factor - ratio of the \nfinanced or invested amount and the economic value \nof the financed company or activity. In our calculation \nprocess, we always seek the best data available, as \nrecommended by the methodology.\nIn the process of defining the baseline of emissions, a \nnumber of methodological decisions are made, which \ncan impact the results determined. Accordingly, it is \nrecommended that, when assessing the data disclosed, \nthe methodological differences applied by different \norganizations when preparing the calculation must \nalso be observed.\nBaseline\nFinanced Emissions Calculation \nPriority sectors indicated by NZBA.\nSector decarbonization targets\nFirst publication: power and coal.\nSector decarbonization plans\nOpportunities, challenges, technologies, \nproducts and services to support clients in \nclimate transition.\nCoverage\nIn the current year, we are considering the loan and \nmarketable security portfolios of our Wholesale \nbank. For all sectors, we assessed the emissions \nassociated with each client’s own operation and \nconsumption of energy (scopes 1 and 2) and, for \nthe sectors in which the indirect emissions (scope 3) \nare material and available, they were also accounted \nfor. This process will be continuously improved as \nthe quality and availability of information increase. \nFor the Power Generation sector the scope 1 of \nclients’ emissions was considered for the purpose \nof establishing the sector target, following the \nmarket practices.\nUse of scenarios and definition of targets\nAs recommended by NBZA, we use scientific \nscenarios that are in line with the Paris Agreement, \nwhich take into consideration a limit for the increase \nof temperature at 1.5oC with Net Zero by 2050, with \nno overshooting or limited overshooting.\nFor the power generation sector, we established a \nreduction target based on the intensity of emissions \n– greenhouse gas emissions per kWh, since the \ndecarbonization efforts imply the electrification of \nenergy consumption and the expansion of the offer \nof renewable energy. Meanwhile, for the thermal \ncoal sector, we chose to adopt a target for phasing \nout the sector. \nco²\n31 \nItaú Unibanco Holding S.A.climate report 2022\nDecarbonization of the Power Generation \nportfolio\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
