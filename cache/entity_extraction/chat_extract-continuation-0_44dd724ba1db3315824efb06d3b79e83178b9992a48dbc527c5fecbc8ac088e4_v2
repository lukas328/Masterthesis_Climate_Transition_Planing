For the purposes of \ncomplying with our annual, periodic and interim disclosure obligations in the United Kingdom and the United \nStates we apply a materiality standard based on the applicable rules and regulations governing public reporting \nin the United Kingdom and the United States. However, in our climate-related disclosures, we have adapted our \napproach to materiality based on both the subject matter and purpose of the disclosures. In particular, when we \nbelieve that doing so may allow us to better address climate-related matters of interest to our key stakeholders, \nour approach to these disclosures may sometimes have regard to broader understandings of materiality based on \ncertain external frameworks and reporting guidelines that take into consideration a wider range of factors relevant \nto climate-related disclosures, including the views of our key stakeholders and our ambition to be a leading bank \nin the UK helping to address the climate challenge. To accommodate this approach to materiality, we may \noccasionally have regard to new frameworks and standards when we believe that doing so may allow us to better \nunderstand and address climate-related matters. \nThis report uses longer time frames to assess potential impacts than those time frames customarily used in \ncertain of our other disclosures, including our annual, periodic and interim financial reports filed with the London \nStock Exchange (‘LSE’) in the United\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NATWEST GROUP PLC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>NATWEST GROUP PLC is a major UK-based banking and financial services organization committed to responsible banking, climate action, and supporting enterprise and learning initiatives.
