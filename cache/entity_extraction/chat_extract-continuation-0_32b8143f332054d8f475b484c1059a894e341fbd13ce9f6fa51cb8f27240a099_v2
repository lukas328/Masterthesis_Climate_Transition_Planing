This partnership \nis evidence of clear progress towards JM’s published milestone in Hydrogen Technologies and \nwill significantly contribute towards JM’s 2030 target for 50 million tonnes of GHG emissions \navoided per year.\nIn the context of a challenging market environment, and the progress made against our \nlong-term strategy, the committee considered the level of payout from our incentive plans \nas appropriate.\n2022/23 incentive plan outcomes\nThe Committee always seeks to ensure that there is a clear link between pay and \nperformance. Additionally, we will continue to focus on setting stretching performance \ntargets and consider the performance of the wider business and individual accomplishment \nover the period, including how the performance was delivered. In that context, we believe \nthat the payments outlined in this report fairly reflect the performance achieved.\nAnnual Incentive Plan (AIP)\nThe maximum bonus opportunity for 2022/23 remained unchanged at 180% of salary \nfor the Chief Executive Officer and 150% of salary for the Chief Financial Officer. The bonus \nwas based on underlying PBT (50%), working capital (20%) and strategic and transformation \nobjectives (30%).\nBased on a robust underlying financial performance, the outcome of our AIP results in a \nbonus of 75% of maximum is payable to both Liam Condon and Stephen Oxley. The \ncommittee is comfortable that the outcome of the bonus is appropriate and so no discretion \nhas been applied. One half of the bonus payable will be deferred in shares for a period of \nthree-years. More details on the performance against the annual targets and strategic \nobjectives are set out on page 121.\nPerformance Share Plan (PSP)\nNeither Liam Condon or Stephen Oxley have any Performance Share Plan (PSP) awards that \nwere eligible to vest in respect of the three-year performance period ending 31st March 2023.\nThe PSP award granted on 1st August 2020 was based on challenging earnings per share and \ntotal shareholder return performance targets for the three-year period ending 31st March \n2023. The outcome of this award was a performance below the threshold targets. As a result, \nthere is no vesting for either executive directors or any other participants in the PSP. The \ncommittee was comfortable that the formulaic outcome is appropriate and so no discretion \nhas been applied.\nOverall, the committee is satisfied that the Remuneration Policy operated as intended \nduring the year.\nDirectors’ Remuneration Policy\nThe 2023 AGM marks the three-year anniversary of our current Remuneration Policy. \nAs a result, we will be seeking shareholder approval for an updated Remuneration Policy \nat our forthcoming AGM.\nDuring the year a full review process was undertaken that considered the pay model, the \nhistoric relationship between performance and reward, the alignment between performance \nmetrics and strategy, and alignment with institutional investors’ best practice. All of this was \nconsidered in light of our reinvigorated strategy.\nHaving had regard to these factors, with the current Remuneration Policy operating \neffectively against each of the review criteria, the committee concluded that subject to some \nminor refinements to the approach to target setting and the choice of performance metrics, \nthe current Remuneration Policy would be largely retained. A summary of the minor changes \nto the policy are set out on page 107.\nApplying the Remuneration Policy in 2023/24\nBase salary\nWith high inflation impacting the cost of living, the company set aside a higher pay budget \nfor its annual pay awards in July 2022 with a greater portion of the budget set aside for \nnon-management roles. In addition, the company paid a temporary monthly allowance \nto employees below a certain earnings level to provide additional support until June 2023.\nThe pay budget for the forthcoming year has also been set at a higher level compared \nto historic norms given that the cost-of-living pressures continue in many countries. Again, \na greater proportion of the budget is being allocated to lower paid employees. For example, \nfor the coming year the UK salary budget for non-management roles is 5.25% and for \nmanagement roles is 4.0%.\nWith regard to the salary increase for executive directors the committee considered the \nUK salary budget for the forthcoming year and deemed it appropriate that the salary increase \nawarded to executive directors should be at a discount to that awarded to other employees. \nAs such executive director salaries were increased by 3.5% with effect from 1st April 2023.\nAIP\nThe maximum opportunity will remain at 180% of salary for the CEO and 150% of salary for \nthe CFO, and the target will continue to be set at 50% of the maximum. However, the payout \nfor threshold performance will reduce from 15% of maximum (equivalent to 30% of target) \nto 25% of the target bonus opportunity, which represents a modest toughening of the bonus \nstructure. This change is being made for all participants in our annual incentive plans and will \nresult in greater focus on delivery against the group’s targeted performance levels.\nThe performance targets for executive directors will be based on group underlying PBT \n(50%), working capital days (20%) and strategic targets (30%) that are aligned with \ndelivering against our transformation strategy. \nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 2023104\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION\nRemuneration\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>JOHNSON MATTHEY<|><organization><|>Johnson Matthey is a global specialty chemicals and sustainable technologies company focused on catalysis, battery materials, and clean energy solutions, including hydrogen technologies and emission reduction initiatives)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PLUG POWER<|><organization><|>Plug Power is a leading provider of turnkey hydrogen solutions, including fuel cells and electrolysers, supporting the global green hydrogen economy and accelerating clean energy deployment)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JM<|><organization><|>JM refers to Johnson Matthey, a company involved in hydrogen technologies and sustainability targets, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 50 million tonnes annually by 2030)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JANUARY 2023<|><event><|>The date when Johnson Matthey entered a strategic partnership with Plug Power to advance hydrogen solutions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HYDROGEN TECHNOLOGIES<|><organization><|>Hydrogen Technologies encompasses Johnson Matthey's initiatives in developing fuel cells, electrolysers, and related hydrogen solutions to support the green hydrogen economy)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Liam Condon<|><person><|>Liam Condon is a senior executive at Johnson Matthey, involved in strategic decision-making and performance management, including incentive plans and remuneration policies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Stephen Oxley<|><person><|>Stephen Oxley is a senior executive at Johnson Matthey, responsible for financial oversight and involved in executive remuneration and strategic targets)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>2022/23<|><event><|>The fiscal year during which Johnson Matthey's incentive plans and performance evaluations took place)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Hydrogen Technologies<|><organization><|>Hydrogen Technologies is a strategic focus area for Johnson Matthey, aiming to contribute significantly to emission reductions and sustainable energy solutions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>50 million tonnes<|><event><|>Johnson Matthey's target for annual greenhouse gas emissions avoided by 2030 through its hydrogen and sustainability initiatives)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOHNSON MATTHEY<|>PLUG POWER<|>Johnson Matthey entered a strategic partnership with Plug Power in January 2023 to accelerate hydrogen deployment<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOHNSON MATTHEY<|>HYDROGEN TECHNOLOGIES<|>Johnson Matthey is actively developing and deploying hydrogen solutions as part of its strategic focus<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Liam Condon<|>JOHNSON MATTHEY<|>Liam Condon is a senior executive involved in Johnson Matthey's strategic and performance management<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Stephen Oxley<|>JOHNSON MATTHEY<|>Stephen Oxley is a senior executive responsible for financial oversight at Johnson Matthey<|>7)\n##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
