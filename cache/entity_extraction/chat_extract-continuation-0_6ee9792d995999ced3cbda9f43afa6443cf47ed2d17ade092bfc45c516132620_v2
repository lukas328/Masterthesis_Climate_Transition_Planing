At the \ntime of the analysis disclosed in this report, the data available for calculating financed emissions \nand emissions intensity and measuring progress was nearly two years old, given the availability \nof the data at the time. For example, the 2030 targets and baselines set for new sectors — Auto \nManufacturing, Commercial Real Estate, Steel and Thermal Coal Mining — were developed using 2020 \nemissions data, which given corporate reporting timelines was the most recent data available at \nthe time we began the analysis. We also used 2020 emissions data for this year’s annual reporting \non Energy and Power portfolios. Our data team is working with leading aggregation vendors of \ncorporate disclosure on environmental metrics; however , the lag on reporting and collection remains \ndifficult to address. Therefore, we currently face a data mismatch — we are using 2021 financial data \nto represent our credit exposure and the clients’ financials, but are pairing that with 2020 emissions. \nWe hope that emissions data will continue to improve and that the data lag will diminish as disclosure \nregimes evolve. \nGiven the current data availability lag across relevant sectors, we have used 2020 emissions data \nacross our calculations for consistency purposes, except for the project finance portfolio, where we are \nfully estimating emissions based on 2021 project production data. Given the current data availability \nlag, it is possible that our progress against our targets will be similarly delayed, potentially delaying our \nconfirmation of any progress against such targets.  \nCiti plans to undertake reviews of our targets after five years. We will continue to be transparent about \nthe impacts of the data lag while moving forward with our climate commitments, notwithstanding this \nconstraint. We believe that increased attention to climate disclosure, including mandatory disclosure in \nmany jurisdictions, will ultimately reduce the data lag, enabling our reported results to be more timely \nand reflect current progress.\nTCFD REPORT 2022: CITI’S APPROACH TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND NET ZERO | 25\nAchieving 2030 Targets  \nBelow, we provide an update to our timeline indicating the steps we are taking to achieve our 2030 targets, \nincluding the new sectors.   \n1 Refer to page 30 for further details on the Net Zero Review Template and page 41 for further details on the CRAS. \n2 New sectors include: Auto Manufacturing, Commercial Real Estate, Steel and Thermal Coal Mining.\nH1  \n2022\nH2  \n2022\nH1  \n2023\nH2  \n2023\nH1  \n2024\n \n...H2  \n2024\nAssess targets for Agriculture, Aluminum,  \nAviation, Cement and Shipping loan portfolios\nInitiate facilitated emissions calculations  \nfor sectoral capital markets portfolios  \nonce PCAF methodology is finalized; target \nsetting will be considered subsequently\nComplete initial two-year client engagement  \nand assessment process for Energy and Power\nRoll out Net Zero Review Template for additional \nsectors, as 2030 targets are set1\nClient engagement and assessment  \nprocess for the four new sectors2\nAssess climate risk exposure across our  \nlending portfolios and review client \ndecarbonization and transition progress\nReview and, as needed, update risk appetite \nthresholds\nReview and update ESRM Policy sectoral \napproaches as needed\nRoll out Climate Risk Assessment & Scorecard \n(CRAS) for additional sectors1 \nSupport existing and new clean technologies \nto accelerate commercialization\nTransition advisory and finance, including \ndebt and equity underwriting and lending\nActive portfolio analysis and management \nto align with net zero targets including \nconsideration of client transition plans \nSupport enabling public policy and regulation in \nthe U.S. and other countries where relevant\nNet Zero Metrics and Target Setting\nClient Engagement and Assessment\nRisk Management\nClimate Advisory and Transition Finance\nPortfolio Management\nPublic Policy and Regulatory Engagement\nRollout Ongoing\nRollout Ongoing\nOngoing\nOngoing Assessment\n2030\nAUTO \nMANUFACTURING\n31% reduction \nemissions  \nintensity  \n(106 g CO2e/km)\nCOMMERCIAL  \nREAL ESTATE\n41% reduction \nemissions  \nintensity  \n(36 kg CO2e/m2)\nENERGY\n29% reduction  \nabsolute  \nemissions  \n(102.1 million  \nmt CO2e)\nPOWER\n63% reduction \nemissions  \nintensity  \n(115 kg  \nCO2e/MWh)\nSTEEL\nSSP Climate  \nAlignment  \nScore = 0\nTHERMAL  \nCOAL MINING\n90% reduction \nabsolute  \nemissions (793 \nthousand mt CO2e)\n26 | TCFD REPORT 2022: CITI’S APPROACH TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND NET ZERO\nA Note on Our Progress Toward 2030 Targets  \nClimate-related data and methodologies continue to evolve and improve. For data from 2019 to \n2020, the most recent emissions data available at the time of our analysis for our 2020 and 2021 \nfinanced emissions footprints, Citi found that more companies reported their climate-related data \n(for example, Scope 1 and 2 emissions data disclosure in our Energy portfolio increased 2% by \nexposure). This has resulted in improved PCAF data quality scores for Energy and Power financed \nemissions from 2020 to 2021. As more clients directly reported their emissions, we were able to \nreduce the number of estimates we utilize when calculating our emissions metrics; our scores \nare higher as disclosures and verified data become available.
