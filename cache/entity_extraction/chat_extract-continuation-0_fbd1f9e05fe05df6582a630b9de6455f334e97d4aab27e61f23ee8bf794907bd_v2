More details can be found here. \nMost of Bupa’s GHG emissions are generated in our \nvalue chain (scope 3), and especially by our suppliers \nand our healthcare providers. That’s why we have \nfocused on engaging our biggest suppliers and \nhealthcare providers on aligning with our scope 3 \nnet zero target. \nWe have focused on strategic suppliers (i.e. very \nlarge suppliers or suppliers where there is multi-\nMarket Unit spend) along with suppliers who contribute \nmost greatly to our emissions. For more information \nregarding our approach to sustainable procurement, \nplease see page 32. \nWe have also started engaging with our UK healthcare \nproviders to support our net zero 2040 ambition \nthrough reductions in scope 3 emissions, focusing \non our key strategic partners to start to co-develop a \ndashboard comparing the progress of hospital groups. \nTo find out more information on how we’re reducing our \nimpact on the environment, please visit the Mission Zero \npage on Bupa.com here. \n2022 Group and UK operations GHG \nemissions footprint \nIn accordance with the Streamlined Energy and Carbon \nReporting (SECR) requirements of a large unquoted UK \ncompany, we are reporting our UK-based energy usage \nand GHG emissions. In addition, we are reporting the \nGroup's energy consumption and GHG emissions \ncompared to full year 2021, and 2019, our base year, to \nshow progress against our interim scope 1 and 2 GHG \nemissions reduction target of 40% by 2025. We will \npublish our detailed full year 2022 GHG emissions \nreport covering scope 1, 2 and selected scope 3 \n(category 3 - fuel and energy-related activities and \ncategory 6 - business travel) later in 2023 on Bupa.com \nfollowing external limited assurance. Our full year 2022 \nGHG emissions report will reflect our most up-to-date \nGHG emissions position, including actual fourth quarter \nactivity data which, in part, has been estimated based \non, but not limited to previous consumption trends. \nWe adopt the operational control approach, meaning \nwe account for 100% of emissions from business \nlocations over which we have control. Under this \napproach, control is considered where we have the \nauthority to introduce and implement operational \npolicies. In accordance with the GHG Protocol’s \nguidance on dual-reporting, we report scope 2 GHG \nemissions using both the location and market-based \napproach.
