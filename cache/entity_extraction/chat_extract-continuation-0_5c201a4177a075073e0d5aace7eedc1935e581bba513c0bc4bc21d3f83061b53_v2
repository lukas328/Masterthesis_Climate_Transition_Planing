In the \nAmericas, the high value Class 8 truck cycle peaked during the last quarter of our fiscal year. \nAs expected, our heavy duty sales benefited from this cycle and were also supported by \nimproved product mix. Sales in Asia declined as COVID lockdowns in China significantly \nimpacted vehicle production and led to customers building stock in the prior year in \nanticipation of these lockdowns. Looking ahead, our leading position in heavy duty means \nwe are well placed to benefit from future developments including hydrogen powered internal \ncombustion engines.\nUnderlying operating profit\nUnderlying operating profit declined 28% to £230 million and margins decreased to 8.7%. \nThis largely reflected cost inflation, product mix, lower volumes, and the transactional \nimpact of exchange rates. We saw a sequential improvement in margins during the year, \nbenefiting from an acceleration in the recovery of cost inflation and benefits from our \ntransformation programme.\nOn track to deliver at least £4 billion of cash in the decade to 2030/311\nWe delivered another year of strong cash flow as we continue to focus on driving efficiencies, \noptimising capital expenditure and working capital. We generated around £600² million \nof cash and a cumulative £1.4 billion² since 2021/22, the first year of this guidance. \nPGM Services\nPerformance reflects lower average PGM prices and reduced refinery volumes\n• Sales performance primarily reflects lower average PGM prices and reduced refinery volumes \ndue to lower auto scrap levels as a result of the continued buoyant used car market\n• Underlying operating profit was down mainly due to lower average PGM prices and reduced \nrefinery volumes\n• Cost inflation was more than offset by efficiencies as well as higher pricing across both our \nrefining and products businesses\nYear ended 31st March\n % change\n% change, \nconstant FX \nrates\n2023\n£ million\n2022 \n£ million\nSales \nPGM Services 570 587 -3 -8\nUnderlying operating profit 257 308 -17 -21\nUnderlying margin 45.1% 52.5%\nReported operating profit 257 307\nPGM Services is the world’s largest recycler of platinum group metals (PGMs). This business \nhas an important role in enabling the energy transition through providing circular solutions \nas demand for scarce critical materials increases. PGM Services provides a strategic service \nto the group, supporting Clean Air, Catalyst Technologies and Hydrogen Technologies with \nsecurity of metal supply in a volatile market, recycling capabilities and manufactures value \nadded PGM products for both internal and external customers. \nIn PGM Services, sales declined 8% against a strong prior year. This was primarily driven \nby lower average PGM prices, where average prices for platinum, palladium and rhodium \ndeclined around 10%, 20% and 30% compared to the prior year. Recent PGM price weakness \nhas been driven by lower auto demand and also liquidation of some excess rhodium positions \nin an illiquid market.\nIn our refineries, intake volumes were down as expected due to lower auto scrap resulting \nfrom a buoyant used car market. Sales were partly offset by benefits from operational \nefficiency and higher pricing. In a volatile market, our metal trading business had another \ngood year, with sales only moderately down against a strong prior period. \nAcross our PGM products businesses, sales were moderately down. This was primarily driven \nby lower sales of catalysts for the pharmaceutical and agricultural chemicals markets due \nto the phasing of customers’ orders.\nUnderlying operating profit\nUnderlying operating profit declined 21% mainly impacted by lower average PGM prices  \n(c. £55 million impact3) and reduced refinery volumes. Cost inflation was more than offset \nby efficiency benefits, as well as higher pricing across both our refining and products businesses. \nNotes:\n1. At least £4 billion of cash under our range of scenarios from 1st April 2021 to 31st March 2031. Cash target pre-tax and post \nrestructuring costs\n2. Delivered around £600 million of cash in 2022/23 at actual precious metal prices, which equates to just over £400 million at constant \nprices (March 2022). Delivered around £1.4 billion cumulatively since 2021/22 at actual metal prices\n3. Gross PGM price impact was c. £55 million, which was partly offset by foreign exchange benefits.
