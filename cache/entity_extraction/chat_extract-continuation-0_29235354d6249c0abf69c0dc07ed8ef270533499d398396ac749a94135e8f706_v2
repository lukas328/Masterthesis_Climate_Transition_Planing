Examples of some of the principal decisions taken by the Board during the year and the stakeholder views and inputs considered as part of these decisions are on \npages 84 to 86.\nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 202384\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION\nStakeholder engagement in action\nStakeholder engagement is vital to building a sustainable business. The Board recognises  \nthe need to foster positive business relationships with suppliers, customers and governments.  \nThis section provides more details on how the directors have fulfilled their duties. \nThe matters we consider differ in relevance for each stakeholder, and sometimes stakeholders \nmay have conflicting interests. We aim to consider the key issues relevant to each stakeholder \ngroup, and our decisions will ultimately promote the group’s long-term success and support \nour vision, purpose and strategy. In making decisions, we consider the interests of \nstakeholders across the company – not just at board level.\n1 2\nTransforming the way we operate\nOur transformation programme is driving greater efficiency and cost savings through simplifying and \nmodernising the way we work. Following the strategic review, our focus has been structured around key pillars, \nincluding external milestones, culture, efficiency and growth. The Board receives updates on transformational \nworkstreams associated with each of these pillars at every meeting. This allows the Board to maintain effective \noversight and an opportunity to assess the impact on our different stakeholders.\nStakeholder considerations\nOur people: We understand the impact that transformation can have on our people and that driving cultural \nand behavioural changes takes time. We listened to our people through our employee engagement surveys. \nThese helped shape our discussions during our strategic review last year. As a board we have reviewed our \nown governance processes and approved a simplified delegation of authority and changes to the Governance \nFramework, which reduced the number of GLT sub-committees. \nInvestors: Through our transformation programme updates, we closely monitor performance against external \nmilestones. This allows us to challenge management and demand greater accountability, ensuring the effective \ndelivery of our strategy for our investors and wider stakeholders. Our transformation programme will accelerate \nour growth, drive efficiencies and cost savings across the group, ultimately providing better long-term returns \nfor our investors. \nSuppliers: The Board has considered how best to support suppliers and by simplifying and clarifying processes \nand systems, it allows greater ability to support smaller suppliers with shorter payment terms. This in turn \nsupports the Board’s commitment to prompt payment.\nOutcomes and impact on our long-term success\nWe believe that JM needs to become simpler, more agile and more cost-effective in order to focus on longer-\nterm, sustainable value growth. The transformation programme will drive stronger execution, unlock \nnear-term cost opportunities and strengthen our capabilities in capital project execution and cross-group \ncommercial synergies.\nSafeguarding our people and our operations\nAs part of the Board’s deep dives, we reviewed process safety across the group. Process safety relates to the risk \nof major accidents during processing of hazardous chemicals or substances. Such accidents, typically fires, \nexplosions and toxic releases, have the potential to cause severe harm to people and the environment, both \non and off-site. Several actions were identified in the review and an independent third party was engaged \nto undertake an audit of the process safety management programme and major risk priorities.\nStakeholder considerations\nOur people, investors and communities: Our process safety and wider EHS procedures keep our people safe in \nthe workplace. Accidents can have a catastrophic impact on people, the environment and business. Whilst these \nsignificant catastrophic events are rare within JM and the wider chemical industry, the Board wanted to ensure \nthat the management system was robust, with leadership driving a strong process safety culture. The audit \nreviewed our practices against industry best practices enabling us to monitor their implementation across \nvarious JM sites.\nOutcomes and impact on our long-term success\nThe independent audit commenced in January 2023 and the results will be reported to the Board. As part of the \naudit, the third party met with group, business and site leadership, covering various topics agreed by the Board, \nincluding protocols, process safety performance indicators and escalation methods to management. Following \nthe completion of the meetings with leadership and the final report to the Board, a detailed action plan will \nbe created to ensure that our process safety is in line with industry best practice.\nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 2023 85\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION\nStakeholder engagement continued\nStrategic partnerships that deliver against our milestones\nThe Board approved a long-term strategic partnership with Plug Power to accelerate the green hydrogen \neconomy. This partnership creates a volume and scale for green hydrogen that has not existed until now. \nIt brings together one of the largest green hydrogen and fuel cells companies in the world with our technology \nand manufacturing capabilities.\nStakeholder considerations\nOur people: Plug Power and JM will co-invest in what is expected to be the largest catalyst coated membranes \n(CCMs) manufacturing facility in the world. The facility will be built in the US and is likely to begin production \nin 2025. To support this, we are already increasing our manufacturing capability in the UK through a new 3GW \ngigafactory in Royston, UK. As part of this project and the scale-up of our manufacturing capabilities, there will \ninevitably be new opportunities created for our people to transfer to different roles as we refocus and redirect \nthe group to support our strategic ambitions.  \nInvestors: Our long-term partnership with Plug Power\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>JOHNSON MATTHEY<|><|>ORGANIZATION<|>Johnson Matthey is a global specialty chemicals and sustainable technologies company that focuses on catalysis, precious metals, and chemical processes.
