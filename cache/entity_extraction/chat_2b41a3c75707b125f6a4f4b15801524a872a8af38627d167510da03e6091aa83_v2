However, due to the pandemic there has been a shift in our reliance \non business travel. Having sought new ways to collaborate that save time, \nmoney and carbon emissions, we are working to ensure our levels of travel \ndo not go back to pre-pandemic levels, embracing the change, benefits and \nenthusiasm around new ways of working.\nWhat? \nWe will cut our business travel by 50% by working with our people and \npartners to rethink how and why we travel.\nHow?\nUnderstanding the data behind our travel emissions has highlighted specific \nlevers to reduce our emissions and achieve our 50% reduction by 2030. \nWorking across the business and with internal and external partners \nwe will implement the following measures:\n – Reduce the need for internal meetings that involve air travel\n – Work with our air travel vendors to understand the measures they  \nare taking to reduce emissions \n – Increase visibility and awareness among our people about the  \nemissions associated with all business journeys and potential  \nsavings by switching classes\nRethinking how and why we travel \nfor business \nLSEG CLIMATE TRANSITION PLAN 202223\nCONTENTS\nFigure 3: Travel reduction pathway\nThe impact of Covid-19 reduced our business travel emissions significantly from 2020-2021, enabling \nus to be well ahead of our target. As the pandemic recedes, we want to keep our emissions below \nthe Paris trajectory.\nFrom our 2019 baseline data 96% of travel \nemissions are accounted for with air travel alone. \nBetween 2019 and 2021 we recorded a 90% \nreduction in absolute emissions due to the travel \nrestrictions imposed as a result of  \nthe pandemic. We need to ensure that our future \napproach to travel is carefully managed to ensure \nwe meet our emission reduction targets while \nenabling us to effectively serve our customers \nand operate as a global business. \nAll emissions associated with business travel \nfrom 2021 onwards will be offset as part of our \nneutralisation and removals glidepath. In 2022 \nwe will explore adopting an internal price on \ncarbon and carbon budgets for business travel as \na mechanism to encourage considerations and \nprioritisation across the company.\n2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030\nActual emissions - business travelEmissions budgetParis 1.5 trajectory\n0\n5000\n10000\n15000\n20000\n25000\n30000\n35000\n40000\n45000\nEmissions (tCO2e)\nOur supplier base does shift and change year-on-year so it is essential \nthat we track and monitor suppliers, emissions and target data in \ntandem. We will do this in four ways:\n – Supply chain engagement: work collaboratively with suppliers \nthrough a tiered integrated supplier engagement approach. We are \nusing third-party systems and processes to engage our suppliers, \ncollect data and support capacity building.\n – Embedding requirements: embed key sustainability expectations of \nsuppliers throughout procurement activities, including integrating \nambitious climate commitments into RFP and procurement \nprocesses, our supplier code of conduct, new contracts, and \nongoing relationship management. \n – We will also be working with the business divisions to enhance \nsustainability considerations within their operational decisions.\n – Thinking bigger: work with our peers in the industry to push key \nsuppliers and high emitting industries to change their behaviours. \nAs of 2021 17% of suppliers by\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
