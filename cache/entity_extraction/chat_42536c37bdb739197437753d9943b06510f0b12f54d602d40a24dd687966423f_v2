We also subject ourselves to \nexternal audits relating to the certification of the pro-\ncesses in accordance with different international norms, \namongst which are the ISO 9001 (Quality Management \nSystem) and BRC (British Retail Consortium) and IFS (Inter-\nnational Feature Standards) quality certifications.\nOur clients also perform external audits on BRF plants \ncertified for exportation in Brazil, Turkey and Abu Dhabi. \nFurthermore, we have a certification program for our \nsuppliers that is based upon international certification \nrequirements in accordance with the Global Markets \nprogram established by the Global Food Safety Initiative \n(GFSI). In 2022, 95% of the installations operated by our \nsuppliers were GFSI certified. \nIn the field, our production processes are continually \nchecked and audited both by our clients and by interna-\ntional entities. Amongst the certifications that we hold in \nthis area are the ‘Global G.A.P’ for livestock production and \n‘Certified Humane’, for animal welfare seals.\nFinally, regulatory agencies, such as the Ministry of Ag-\nriculture, Livestock and Supply (Mapa) and the National \nSanitary Surveillance Agency (Anvisa) in Brazil; the Ministry \nof Food, Agriculture and Livestock in Turkey; and the Abu \nDhabi Agriculture & Food Safety Authority (Adafsa), audit \nand check our activities, attesting to the compliance of \nour practices with the applicable legal requirements. We \nhave also obtained the Authorized Economic Operator \n(AEO) certification, which is issued by the Brazilian Federal \nInternal Revenue Service, qualifying us as a safe and reli-\nable company in our Overseas Trade Operations.\nPlant Approvals\nWe should further highlight our plants’ export certification \nprocesses for trading with international markets. From \ntechnical preparation to obtaining new qualifications, this \nprocess relates to the provision of proof of different stan-\ndards and aspects of quality that vary depending upon \nthe regulatory scenario of the specific countries. \nIn the second half of 2022, we made significant advances, \nwith our plants obtaining 16 new export certifications to \ncountries such as Canada, Mexico and Japan. In Cana-\nda, for example, the authorizations related to fresh and \nfrozen pork meat and cooked poultry, certifying our plants \nlocated in Toledo (PR) and Campos Novos (SC). The Cam-\npos Novo plant, one of our newest, is certified for export \nto South Korea, China, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Rus-\nsia, Ukraine and Moldova, as well as Paraguay, Uruguay \nand Argentina.\nAt the end of the year , our plant in Lajeado Minuano \nregained its certification to export to China, after it had \nbeen suspended, and, in 2023, we have plans on our \nradar to make further inroads into China as well as into \nthe Americas, such as the Mexican market, and Europe, \nadopting the relevant benchmark standards in quality and \nsafety.
