In case of a discrepancy, the Spanish original will prevail.\nSECTION 03 / MANAGEMENT OF RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CLIMATE CHANGE\nWithin the scope of preparing and defining \nits industry frameworks governing the credit \nadmission process, BBVA has developed \nan internal T axonomy of transition risk in \norder to classify industries according to \ntheir sensitivity to transition risk. In addition, \nmetrics are identified at the customer \nlevel to assess their vulnerability and to \nintegrate this aspect into risk and customer \nsupport decisions. \nThe estimation of the transition risk-\nsensitivity level is based on the qualitative \nanalysis of the amount of exposure to \nregulatory, technological and market \nchanges caused by decarbonization \nthat may have a financial impact on the \ncompanies of the industry and on the \nestimation of the time horizon impact of \nthese effects.\nTherefore, industries are categorized \naccording to their level of sensitivity to \ntransition risk: very high, high, moderate \nor low. The industries identified as most \nsensitive to transition risk are energy \nor fossil fuel generation sectors (oil and \ngas, power generation and coal mining); \nemission-intensive basic industries (steel, \ncement); and activities that are final users \nof energy and generators of emissions \nthrough their products or services (vehicles \nmanufacturers, air and sea transportation).\nAs a result of this exercise, with data as at \nDecember 31, 2022, 12.95% of the exposure \n(measured by EAD) of the wholesale \nportfolio (equivalent to 6.69% of the \nGroup’s portfolio) has been identified as \ncorresponding to sectors defined as “high \ntransition risk” , with a high or very high level \nof exposure to this risk. This calculation \nwas made on a portfolio of €209,759 \n(of the Group’s total EAD of €406,097), \ncorresponding to the EAD of the wholesale \nlending portfolio.\nDuring 2022, this calculation was introduced \nfor the small business sector (SMEs and \nthe self-employed). The results obtained \n2022 indicate that the EAD associated \nwith high or very high transition risk in \nthis portfolio is limited, at around 3%, and \nfocused in mainly in Spain and in the autos \n(components) sector.\nIn addition, climate change and \nenvironmental risk impact has been \nincorporated into country risk analysis since \n2019, as an additional input for establishing \nrisk policies affecting exposures to private or \nsovereign administrations of all the countries \nwith which the Bank has some type of risk \n(+100 countries).\nCement\nSteel*\nAutos\nPower \ngeneration\nTransport\nOil & Gas\n0,6%\nCoal 0,1%\n1,4%\n2,2%\n4,8%\n0,7%\n3,2%\nPrepared by BBVA. \nIncludes the percentage of exposure at default of activities internally \ndefined as “transition risk sensitive” over the EAD of the wholesale \nportfolio as of December 31, 2022 (not including the subsidiaries of \nGaranti, Forum Chile, Uruguay, Venezuela and BPI). The “transition \nrisk sensitive” portfolio includes activities that generate energy or \nfossil fuels (energy, power generation -excluding renewable generation \nand water and waste treatment-), coal mining; basic industries with \nemission-intensive processes (steel and cement), final activities \nusers of the energy through their products or services (vehicles \nmanufacturers, air and sea transportation) with a high or very high \nlevel of sensitivity to this risk. The reduction in exposure (measured \nby % EAD) of the wholesale portfolio compared to 2021 is due to the \nincrease in the EAD of the wholesale portfolio in 2022 (from €368,819m \nas of December 31, 2021 to €406,097m as of December 31, 2022) and \nbecause the EAD included in the numerator of the calculation formula, \ndoes not include power generation from renewable sources.\n* Also includes steel industry\nP.  57\nBBVA Report on TCFD 2022\nThis English version is a translation of the original in Spanish for information purposes only.

It reviews the \nclimate policies in place in each relevant \ngeographic area, their effective relevance \nwithin the overall economic policy \nframework, their consistency with the \ntransition to a decarbonized economy \nand whether there may be any bias \non the economic growth of the budget \nbaseline scenario due to its potential \ndevelopment.\n2/ The climate driver has been integrated \ninto the high-level risk scenarios (HLRS) \nwhich are monitored and assessed \ncontinuously in the Group by the \nScenario Working Group. They serve as \na basis for choosing the scenario which \nis used in the Group’s internal capital \nadequacy assessment process (ICAAP).\nIn 2022 different physical risk events in \nSpain were assessed in order to consider \nthem as input in the ICAAP .
