Its policy \nis to optimise interest cost and reduce volatility in reported earnings and equity. The group \nmanages its risk by reviewing the profile of debt regularly and by selectively using interest rate \nswaps to maintain borrowings at competitive rates. At 31st March 2023, 67% (2022: 66%) of \nthe group’s borrowings and related swaps was at fixed rates with an average interest rate of \n3.1% (2022: 3.5%). The remaining debt is floating rate. Based on the group’s borrowings and \nrelated swaps at floating rates, after taking into account the effect of the swaps, a 1% change \nin all interest rates during the current year would have a £5 million impact on the group’s \nprofit before tax (2022: £4 million). \nThe group has designated three (2022: four) fixed rate to floating interest rate swaps as fair \nvalue hedges as they hedge the changes in fair value of bonds attributable to changes in \ninterest rates. All hedging instruments have maturities in line with the repayment dates of the \nhedged bonds and the cash flows of the instruments are consistent. All critical terms of the \nhedging instruments and hedged items matched during the year and, therefore, hedge \nineffectiveness was immaterial. \n \n2023\n£m \n2022\n£m \nCarrying value of hedging instruments at 31st March1 (15) (1)\nAmortised cost (147) (256)\nFair value adjustment 17 3\nCarrying value of hedged items at 31st March1 (130) (253)\nChange in carrying value of hedging instruments recognised in profit \nor loss during the year (14) (13)\nChange in fair value of hedged items during the year used to \ndetermine hedge effectiveness 14 13\n1.

In the prior year there was \nalso the 3.26% $150 million Bonds 2022, Interest rate swaps have been contracted with aligned notional amounts and maturities to the \nbonds with the effect that the group pays an average floating rate of six-month LIBOR plus 0.64% on the US dollar bonds and six-month \nEURIBOR plus 0.94% on the euro bonds. \nPrice risk \nFluctuations in precious metal prices have an impact on the group’s financial results. Our \npolicy for all manufacturing businesses is to limit this exposure by hedging against future price \nchanges where such hedging can be done at acceptable cost. The group enters into forward \nprecious metal price contracts for the receipt or delivery of precious metal. The group does not \ntake material price exposures on metal trading. A proportion of the group’s precious metal \ninventories are unhedged due to the ongoing risk over security of supply. \nLiquidity risk \nThe group’s funding strategy includes maintaining appropriate levels of working capital, \nundrawn committed facilities and access to the capital markets. We regularly review liquidity \nlevels and sources of cash, and we maintain access to committed credit facilities and debt \ncapital markets. At 31st March 2023, the group had borrowings under committed bank \nfacilities of £nil (2022: £nil). The group also has a number of uncommitted facilities and \noverdraft lines at its disposal. \nThe group has a £1 billion revolving credit facility with a maturity date of March 2027 which \nincludes Environmental, Social and Governance KPIs which provides the group with a nominal \ninterest saving or cost depending on our performance. \nIn June 2022 the group drew down on its first three sustainability-linked private placements \n(€225 million £35 million and $50 million). The notes have interest rates linked with Johnson \nMatthey’s Key Performance Indicator for the reduction of its Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas \nemissions and are among the first sustainability-linked financing in the market from a UK \ncorporate issuer. \nDuring the financial year the group also drew down in full and extended the maturity date of \nits £407 million sustainable financing agreement through UK Export Finance (UKEF).
