In particular, this \nreport sets out a framework for transition finance, \nidentifying four financing strategies that could \nfacilitate real-economy transitions. The report \nincludes components, arranged under themes, of \npotential net-zero transition plans. Each component \nincludes recommendations, case studies, and \nexamples. The report does not prescribe a specific \ncourse of action but offers information and options \nto help those financial institutions preparing net-\nzero transition plans.\nSector-specific alliance member firms include \nmany different types of financial institution, \nincluding banks, insurers, asset owners, asset \nmanagers, financial service providers, and \ninvestment consultants. The report recognizes \nthat financial institutions operate in different \ncontractual and regulatory environments that \nmay impact their approaches to the net-zero \ntransition recommendations and voluntary/\nnon-binding, guidance outlined in this report. \nGFANZ acknowledges that net-zero transition \nplans will vary by institution and jurisdiction and \nwill depend on the individual characteristics of \nfinancial institutions, including size, business \nmodel, sector coverage, fiduciary duty toward \ntheir clients, and other factors. The purpose of this \nreport is to provide information that may inform \nfinancial institutions’ independent investment \ndecision-making process in accordance with their \ncontractual duties and the regulatory environment \nin which they operate.\nFor the purposes of this report, the term “GFANZ” \nrefers to the GFANZ Principals Group .\nVoluntary guidance: This report presents a voluntary \nframework for financial institutions to apply when \ndeveloping and implementing net-zero transition \nplans. Financial institutions are encouraged to use \nall five themes in the recommendations, but may \nchoose to focus on a subset of the themes that \nthey determine appropriate for their organization. \nFinancial institutions are encouraged to use these \nrecommendations wherever possible, but not \nsuperseding jurisdictional requirements on transition \nplanning or climate-related financial disclosure \nwhere such requirements exist, or contractual \nrequirements, including mandates with clients. \nSome types of financial institutions may also have \nunique legal or regulatory constraints that may differ \nby jurisdiction and that may impact the extent to \nwhich individual elements of this guidance should \nbe considered. \nPan-sector approach:  These recommendations \nand guidance present a pan-sector approach to \ntransition planning. The principle behind each \nrecommendation or piece of guidance aims to \nbe applicable to institutions across the financial \nsector and to act as a reference for regulators and \npolicymakers. Specific methodological approaches \nor considerations for individual components \nmay differ by type of financial institution, and \nthe relevance may vary for different types of \ninstitutions. The report is principles-based so that \nit can be interpreted and applied at the discretion \nof individual financial institutions’ own processes \nand policies. Financial institutions are encouraged \nto use these recommendations and guidance \nalongside the guidance produced by sector-specific \nnet-zero alliances and other organizations. \nCONTENTS  |  FINANCIAL INSTITUTION NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLANS — FUNDAMENTALS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND GUIDANCE\nv\nUnique roles for different financial institutions: \nBecause this guidance is pan-sector, it does not \nreflect the different roles financial institution \ntypes play within the industry. Thus, as they \ndevelop their transition plans, financial institutions \nare encouraged to consider these types of \nrelationships, focusing where they can on the \nareas where they are likely to be able to support \nclient and portfolio company net-zero strategies \nand manage climate-related financial risk while \nconsidering all elements in this framework. Each \nfinancial institution is encouraged to implement \nthe guidance based on considerations such \nas its business model and the contractual and \nregulatory environment within which it operates. \nThe recommendations and guidance herein should \nbe considered by financial institutions as resources \nand considerations that may be consulted as part \nof their transition planning efforts, not as a specific \ncourse of action.\nFocus on development and implementation: \nThis framework aims to provide an approach for \ndeveloping and implementing transition plans, \nrather than specific guidance on disclosing \ntransition plans. While GFANZ encourages \ntransparent disclosure of transition plans, this \nreport does not intend to provide detailed \nguidance on disclosure. Each financial institution \nshould determine specific content, location, and \nfrequency for disclosing the components of its  \n20 TCFD. Implementing the Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures , October 2021.\ntransition plan, consistent with the requirements   \nof their respective sector-specific alliances, \nbusiness confidentiality, and jurisdictional \nrequirements, if any. When preparing disclosures, \ninstitutions should consider the TCFD’s Principles \nfor Effective Disclosures. 20\nInstitution-wide approach to transition planning:  \nThis guidance focuses on addressing transition \nplanning from the perspective of the whole of \na financial institution. In other words, the focus \nis on aligning the financial institution’s overall \nbusiness strategy with the net-zero transition using \nthe ten components. The guidance details how \nthis strategy can be implemented throughout an \norganization but does not go into significant depth \nfor individual business areas, product lines, or asset \nclasses. Financial institutions should look to their \nnet-zero alliance and other guidance providers for \ngreater detail on how net-zero strategies can be \ndeveloped and implemented at the level of specific \nproducts, services, and transactions.  \nLiving guidance: GFANZ acknowledges that \nsupporting pathways, tools, and methodologies \nmay not yet be available for all situations and\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
