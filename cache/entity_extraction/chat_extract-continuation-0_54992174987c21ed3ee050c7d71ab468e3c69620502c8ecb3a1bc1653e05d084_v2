Specifically, \nwe use performance materiality in determining the \nscope of our audit and the nature and extent of our \ntesting of account balances, classes of transactions and \ndisclosures, for example in determining sample sizes. \nOur performance materiality was 75% (FY21: 75%) of \noverall materiality, amounting to £18.5 million (FY21: \n£15.9 million) for the Group financial statements and \n£6.4 million (FY21: £7.5 million) for the Company \nfinancial statements. \nIn determining the performance materiality, we \nconsidered a number of factors - the history of \nmisstatements, risk assessment and aggregation \nrisk and the effectiveness of controls - and concluded \nthat an amount in the middle of our normal range \nwas appropriate. \nWe agreed with the Audit Committee that we would \nreport to them misstatements identified during our \naudit above £1.2 million (Group audit) (FY21: £1.2 \nmillion) and £0.5 million (Company audit) (FY21: \n£0.5 million) as well as misstatements below those \namounts that, in our view, warranted reporting for \nqualitative reasons. \nConclusions relating to going concern \nOur evaluation of the directors’ assessment of the \nGroup's and the Company’s ability to continue to \nadopt the going concern basis of accounting included: \n▪ Obtaining the Directors’ going concern assessment \nand challenging the rationale for downside scenarios \nadopted and material assumptions made using our \nknowledge of the Group’s business performance, \nreview of regulatory correspondence and obtaining \nfurther corroborating evidence; \n▪ Considering management’s assessment of the Group’s \nregulatory solvency coverage and liquidity position in \nthe forward looking scenarios considered; \n▪ Assessing the impact of severe, but plausible, \ndownside scenarios; \n▪ Assessing liquidity of the Group and Company, \nincluding the Group’s ability to pay customers, \nsuppliers and creditors as amounts fall due; \n▪ Assessing the ability of the Group to comply with \ncovenants; \n▪ Enquiring and understanding the actions taken by \nmanagement to mitigate any significant risks facing \nthe business, including attendance at all Group Audit \nCommittee and Group Risk Committee meetings;
