We do not carry \nsignificant exposure to price risk as we hedge all our metal transactions \ncentrally looking at overall group supply and demand. \nOur PMM business ensures the group has sufficient metal to meet \nbusiness demands and manages our metal liquidity levels. There is a risk \nthat we do not have sufficient metal available. Therefore, we operate \nwithin tight trading limits and defined liquidity levels to manage the \ndemand volatility. Metal price volatility affects how much our Trading \nbusiness earns. The precious metal industry globally is susceptible to \ncriminal activity resulting in the risk of theft, and we share those \nchallenges. Loss or theft due to a failure of the security management \nsystems associated with the protection of metal may result in financial \nloss and / or a failure to satisfy our customers which could reduce our \ncustomers’ confidence in JM and potential legal action. Failure to mitigate \nthis risk can have a significant impact on our working capital, financial \nviability and/or undermine our ability to meet our customer \ncommitments.\n• Long-term strategic planning around metal \nrequirements of the group is undertaken to ensure \nappropriate positioning for the future\n• We run a strong operational control environment within \nour metal trading business\n• We hedge the majority of our metal transactions \ncentrally through looking at the overall group supply \nand demand, minimising our exposure to metal price \nvolatility\n• We maintain a robust security management system \nto protect our metal holdings\n• We have appropriate insurance cover in place\nFormerly ‘Managing our metal commitments’. \nDue to increased crime within the global precious metal industry, the \noverall rating of the risk is increasing.\nWe have continued to strengthen physical security and the operational \nenvironment to ensure we have a proportionate control structure \nto manage and optimise our metal holdings.\nFurthermore, we have launched a metal finance academy to continue \nstrengthening appreciation and understanding of our metal risks across \nthe group.\n10 Failure in one or more of JM’s critical operational assets GLT sponsor: Alastair Judge\nRisk Key mitigations Updates made to principal risk \nA critical asset failure may have a material effect on our supply chains, \nperformance, share value and reputation.\nOur work on the effects of climate change means we understand that \nmore frequent extreme weather events and natural disasters may disrupt \nour operations and increase our costs. \n• We continue to monitor and prioritise critical spare parts \nand capital expenditure for any ageing assets and \ninfrastructure\n• The multi-year capital investment programme across \nPGM Services continues to progress with focus on asset \nrenewal and replacement\n• We continue to implement robust mitigation's at our \nsites, including business impact assessments, business \ncontinuity management plans, asset management \nprogrammes and rigorous support systems for our \noperational technology\n• Group Assurance function reviews business continuity \nplanning (BCP) as part of the Site Extended Audits\n  Formerly ‘Asset failure’.\nWe assess this risk based on the high level of exposure faced by our PGMs \nbusiness.
