auditing team is competent and \ntrained within this area, which can be sensitive � Interviews conduct -\ned with value chain workers provides employees the opportunity to \nbe open about actual working conditions, while at the same time \nensuring transparency �\nGenerally, an onsite audit will also involve a meeting with a worker \nand/or Union-representative, which increases transparency and the \npotential for verification of findings during a document review or \nfactory tour � We do not generally engage directly with workers in the \nsupply chain, but we will request corrective actions if negative \nimpact is disclosed during audits � \nDirect suppliers\nOur own teams from Supplier & Quality Development (SQD) conduct \nonsite audits for direct suppliers � These audits are generally \nperformed as an integrated management system assessment and \nbased upon the completed SBA-questionnaire (Supplier Business \nAssessment) by the specific supplier � The applicable audit protocol \ncovers 14 questions on the Code of Conduct, including human rights, \nlabour rights, working hours, wages, and the grievance mechanism \nfor workers to raise their concerns � Validation of answers is achieved \nby reviewing supporting evidence for each question and engaging in \ndialogue with the supplier management team �\nIn 2022, we initiated the revision of our risk matrix for direct \nsuppliers with the aim to strengthen it by including more risk indices \nwithin Human Rights � A \"Sustainability Risk Supplier\" is defined by \ntheir potential to cause an adverse social and/or environmental \nimpact, while also considering our dependency on the supplier � Thus, \nthe highest risk involves the greatest potential adverse impact \ncombined with a high level of dependency � To determine these risks, \nwe are using country risk data, commodity risk, and specific \nintegrated ESG factors � In 2023, we plan to include the following \nnew risk indices for indirect suppliers: freedom of opinion and \nexpression, indigenous peoples' rights, and ethical behaviour of \nfirms� \nSupply chain auditing target\nOur target for onsite assessment is 100 percent for high-risk \nsuppliers identified for each business unit within a 12-month period � \nWe assess direct suppliers and inform business units internally of \napplicable high-risk suppliers � The internal business units are then \nresponsible for either conducting separate onsite or online audits or \nobtaining recent assessment data � For indirect suppliers, we arrange \nthird party audits � We believe in dialogue and supplier engagement \nand target that each identified non-conformity is followed with a \ncorrective action plan to mitigate negative impact � \nSupplier audits and \nrisk assessment\n55\nVestas Sustainability Report 2022\nSocialIn brief General GovernanceEnvironment Sustainability data Appendix\nWorkers in the value chain\nResults in the year\nIn 2022, we assessed and audited our suppliers in the following ways:\n• We conducted more than 3,200 due diligence assessments for \npotential suppliers, prior to the supplier onboarding process �\n• We commissioned 28 sustainability audits from third parties � Of \nthese, 19 were performed onsite, and 9 were conducted online \ndue to current pandemic restrictions in certain areas � \n• Our own teams also conducted 55 onsite supplier assessments � \n52 scored above 70 percent, which is an acceptable score based \non our risk methodology � For the 3 suppliers that scored below 70 \npercent, improvement tasks were defined and agreed upon by \nVestas and Supplier, or alternative suppliers were found � \n• We reached 100 percent of our onsite assessment targets for \nhigh-risk direct suppliers � By adding ad-hoc audits and investiga -\ntions, we aim to reduce negative impacts on supply chain workers � \nMore than 80 percent of non-conformities were closed within 12 \nmonths and the remaining percentage were in the process of \nconcluding a corrective action plan at the time of this reporting �\nConflict minerals management\nWe conduct additional assessments on suppliers who may be at risk \nof procuring conflict minerals � In 2022, we completed our second \nconflict minerals programme and surveyed 500 suppliers using a \nthird party supply chain data management solution � Supplier \nresponses were submitted by using the Conflict Minerals Reporting \nTemplate (CMRT)� The survey results showed that suppliers who \nparticipated in both the 2021 and 2022 programmes improved \ntheir assessment score by transitioning from high to lower risk \nsmelters � Supplier response rates also increased from 81 percent in \n2021 to 89 percent in 2022� The aim of our conflict minerals \nprogramme is to increase the transparency of our own sourcing, to \neducate our supply chain on avoiding the procurement of conflict \nminerals, and to encourage suppliers to establish their own \nresponsible sourcing programmes � \nRare earth elements\nRare earth elements occur naturally and, once mined and processed, \ncan be used in a variety of industrial applications � These include \npermanent magnets in hybrid car motors and other high-tech \napplications � We use rare earth elements in the tower magnets of all \nnew turbine models, in permanent-magnet generators in the older \nGridStreamer™ models, in the EnVentus™ platform, and in smaller \nquantities throughout many magnets and electronic components \nfound in our turbines � \nThe majority of rare earth minerals are found in the generators of \nturbines � In permanent-magnet generators, there are two types of \nturbine drive train concepts: geared drive trains and gearless direct \ndrive generators � The amount of rare earth elements used in geared \ndrive trains is up to 10 times lower than the amounts used in direct \ndrive generators drivetrains � Today, all Vestas turbines are based on \ntechnology using the less rare earth intensive geared drive trains � \nWe use rare earth elements in our turbines because they make \ngenerators more efficient and more grid\n######################\nOutput:", "role":
