No single business, sector, \ngovernment or stakeholder group can \naffect the necessary transformation \nalone. Every business needs to act;  \nand every business is dependent on \naction from others. This is particularly \nthe case for investors like Phoenix \nGroup with portfolios spanning  \nthe whole economy. \nAs the UK’s largest long-term saving and retirement \nbusiness, we want to use our scale and voice  \nto multiply impact and drive the wider system \nchanges needed to deliver net zero – partly \nbecause it’s the right thing to do and partly \nbecause without wider system changes we are \nunlikely to achieve our net zero targets. We do  \nthis by delivering thought leadership, engaging \ndecision-makers and collaborating with our peers, \nas summarised in table 8.\nWe are focused on working with Government  \nand stakeholders to drive change and secure \ngreater regulatory and policy certainty in the \nfollowing areas:\nA greater level of detail and specificity from  \nthe government on how they will deliver their \nlong-term vision for a net zero economy and its \nstrategy to enable the transition, including \nstrategies and roadmaps to address key challenges \nsuch as decarbonising industry and heating.\nDriving wider system change\nOur approach to driving change\nDelivering \nthought \nleadership\nDelivering impactful \nthought leadership to \ndevelop potential \nsolutions to policy, \nregulatory and market \nbarriers currently \nhindering the net  \nzero transition\nSee page 49 \nEngaging \ndecision- \nmakers\nEngaging directly \nwith regional, national \nand international \npolicy makers, \nregulators and local \ngovernment to inform \nthe debate on the net \nzero transition in the \nreal economy\nSee page 50 \n \nCollaborating \nwith  \npeers\nCollaborating with \nour peers directly  \nand through cross-\nsectoral bodies to \ndevelop new business \nmodels and end-to-\nend solutions \nrequired to unlock \ntransformation  \nat scale\nSee page 51 \nA clear, sector-specific regulatory and \ninvestment framework which provides the \nnecessary ambition and support to enable \nindustry and investors to make large, \nlong-term strategic commitments that  \nwill enable private sector investment into \nclimate solutions to flow at scale.\nSupportive financial sector regulation \nacross a long-term time horizon and with  \na focus on outcomes. This includes reforms  \nto Solvency II and the creation of new  \nvehicles which will enable asset owners  \nand pension providers to invest a greater \nproportion of capital in long-term illiquid \nassets such as green infrastructure, and  \nin innovative green tech companies. \nMarket transformation  such as working with \ncompanies, tech developers and regional \ngovernment to develop new investable \nbusiness models and partnerships that \nunlock investment at scale.\nIntegration of net zero with other issues  \nto ensure that the net zero transition is \naligned with wider action to protect the \nnatural environment – for example through \naction to make the UK a leader on voluntary \ncarbon markets and ensure rigour in use  \nof carbon credits and offsets.\nTable 8: Our approach to driving system-wide change\n2\n48\nPhoenix Group Holdings plc Net Zero Transition Plan\nInvest Engage Lead\nEmbedding net zero \nin our business\nBecoming a \nnet zero business Measuring our progress\nExecutive \nsummary\nDriving wider system change continued \nDelivering thought leadership\nWhere policy, regulatory and market \nbarriers are currently preventing us \nand others from achieving our net \nzero targets, we want to play a \nmeaningful role in overcoming them \nthrough delivering a targeted \nprogramme of thought leadership. \nWe will identify the issues and opportunities where \nwe think we can make the biggest difference, \nbased on a range of considerations including \nwhere we perceive there to be the greatest need \nfor thought leadership and where we feel we  \nhave a natural role in the debate.\nThis will build on recent thought leadership \npublished in 2022 on topics including:\n• Why decarbonising our investment portfolio \nmakes business and planetary sense\n• Universal ownership and the role of stewardship \nfor net zero – and why divestment alone is  \na blunt instrument when it comes to fossil  \nfuel assets\n• Galvanizing investment in green growth\nOur thought leadership priority is overcoming \nbarriers that are currently holding back investment \nin climate solutions. Analysis by the ABI suggests \nthat £2.7 trillion needs to be invested in climate \nsolutions by 2035 and a further £3.0 trillion \nbetween 2035 and 2050.
