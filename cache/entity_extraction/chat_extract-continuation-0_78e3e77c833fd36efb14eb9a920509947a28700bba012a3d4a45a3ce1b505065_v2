We delivered c. £45 million in efficiency savings during \nthe year, well on the way to achieving our target of £150 million annualised savings by end \n2024/25. Our capital projects programme is also on track in terms of the amount invested, \nexpected returns and timing of execution.\nWe acted quickly to get costs down when the war in Ukraine disrupted supply chains and \nadded to significant inflation. But inflation has impacted a range of inputs to our operations, \nincluding energy. Importantly, we did not allow the short-term impacts to deter us from \nmaking strategic investments to position JM for long-term growth. These investments are \nincredibly important as many future opportunities will rely on the expanded capacity we are \ncurrently building.\nPlatinum group metal prices were volatile during 2022/23 and lower on average than the \nprior year. The PGMS business also saw lower volumes of automotive scrap, which impacted \nthe performance of our refining business. This was partially offset by efficiency savings made \nduring the year. Meanwhile, we continued to invest in updating our infrastructure assets \nand expanding our capacity.\nCatalyst Technologies is making good progress towards its goal of winning large-scale \nprojects, with five added to its portfolio during the year. Higher prices, improved mix and cost \nsavings offset cost inflation and the impact of the loss of business in Russia. Investment \ncontinued, however, with the capacity expansion project at our facility in Perstorp, Sweden, \nproceeding to plan.\nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 2023 53\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION\n\nThe Hydrogen Technologies business was insulated from some of the market headwinds that \nimpacted our other businesses, with sales more than doubling over the course of 2022/23 to \nreach £55 million. The business is benefiting from rapid growth in interest in hydrogen fuel \ncells and clean hydrogen production, and we announced a large-scale partnership with \nPlug Power, which will see us jointly build a significant new facility in the US. HT is already \ninvesting to expand its capacity in the UK, with our new major site in Royston in the UK due \nto complete construction in 2023/24. \nWhile Clean Air’s results were below the prior year impacted by lower auto and truck \nproduction and significant cost inflation, we underpinned the longer-term future of that \nbusiness with some key business wins. Notably, we won all of Mercedes-Benz’s light duty \ndiesel business in Europe. Looking ahead, the Euro 7 proposals and updated US EPA \nlegislation are expected to act as tailwinds for the business. Clean Air increased sales during \n2022/23 to £2.6 billion and the business is on track to achieve its target of more than \n£4 billion of cash in the decade to 2030/31, having delivered cumulative cashflow of  \n£1.4 billion to date. \nIn the year, we completed the sale of Piezo Products while the sale of Diagnostic Services \nis expected to complete in the third quarter of calendar 2023. These represent good progress \nagainst our strategic milestone of divesting our Value Businesses by the end of 2023/24 \nand generating at least £300 million in proceeds. \nStrengthening our commercial muscle\nWe have made encouraging progress in bringing greater commerciality into the business. \nThis has included reinvigorating the incentive programme for our sales teams and sharpening \nour focus on pricing discipline. The fruits of these efforts can be seen in the results for the \nsecond half of the year, not least in the increasing recovery of significant cost inflation – such \nthat by the end of the year we had recovered £95 million, of inflation through increased pricing.\nThe actions we have already taken as part of the transformation programme have laid strong \nfoundations. This is only the beginning of the process, and there is much more work to be \ndone to drive efficiency, remove complexity and further reduce costs. To become a more \ncommercially minded and customer-focused business, we will remain focused on disciplined \nexecution of our strategy and pursuing our purpose of catalysing the net zero transition \nfor our customers. \nA bright future ahead\nThe significant customer wins during 2022/23 are testament to the size of the opportunity \nahead for JM. They are also confirmation that our strategy is focused on the right areas. \nWith unprecedented interest (and growing urgency) around the energy transition, \nthe market is well and truly moving towards JM. \nIt is a great position to be in, but one that we need to be prepared for. We will continue \nto execute our strategy, cautiously increasing the scale and the pace of our ambition while at \nthe same time driving the transformation of the business for growth and increased profitability.\nI can honestly say I am more excited now about the prospects for JM than at any time since \nI joined two years ago. As we emerge from a difficult economic environment in stronger \nshape, I’m confident a much brighter future is within our reach, and as we help the world \nbuild a more sustainable future. \nFinally, I would like to say thank you to our teams for the hard work and dedication they have \nagain shown this year. The transformation of our company is beginning to bear fruit which \nis a testament to their focus and commitment.\nStephen Oxley\nChief Financial Officer\nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 202354\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION\nChief Financial Officer’s review continued\nFinancial performance review\nReported results Underlying results (continuing)¹\nYear ended 31st March Year ended 31\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>JOHNSON MATTHEY<|><organization><|>Johnson Matthey is a global specialty chemicals and sustainable technologies company focused on catalysis, precious metals, and clean energy solutions, with ongoing investments in capacity expansion and strategic projects.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PLUG POWER<|><organization><|>Plug Power is a US-based company specializing in hydrogen fuel cell technology and clean hydrogen production, partnering with Johnson Matthey to build a new facility.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLEAN AIR<|><organization><|>Clean Air is a division of Johnson Matthey that develops emission control technologies, with recent wins in Mercedes-Benz diesel business and targets for future growth.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CATALYST TECHNOLOGIES<|><organization><|>Catalyst Technologies is a division of Johnson Matthey focused on winning large-scale projects in catalysis, with recent project additions and capacity expansion in Sweden.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PERSTORP<|><geo><|>Perstorp is a location in Sweden where Johnson Matthey is expanding its capacity through a facility upgrade.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROYSTON<|><geo><|>Royston is a UK site where Johnson Matthey is investing to expand its hydrogen capacity, with construction due to complete in 2023/24.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EURO 7<|><event><|>Euro 7 is a legislative proposal in Europe that is expected to act as a tailwind for Johnson Matthey's Clean Air business.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>US EPA<|><event><|>US Environmental Protection Agency legislation updates that are anticipated to benefit Johnson Matthey's Clean Air division.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MERCEDEZ-BENZ<|><organization><|>Mercedes-Benz is an automotive manufacturer that awarded Johnson Matthey all of its light-duty diesel business in Europe.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PIEZO PRODUCTS<|><organization><|>Piezo Products was a business unit of Johnson Matthey that was sold in 2023 as part of strategic divestments.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DIAGNOSTIC SERVICES<|><organization><|>Diagnostic Services is a Johnson Matthey business expected to be sold in 2023 as part of the company's strategic milestone to divest value businesses.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STEPHEN OXLEY<|><person><|>Stephen Oxley is the Chief Financial Officer of Johnson Matthey, responsible for financial strategy and reporting.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UK<|><geo><|>United Kingdom, where Johnson Matthey is expanding its hydrogen capacity with a new site in Royston.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SWEDEN<|><geo><|>Sweden, where Johnson Matthey is expanding capacity at its Perstorp facility.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOHNSON MATTHEY<|>PLUG POWER<|>Johnson Matthey partnered with Plug Power to build a new hydrogen facility in the US<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOHNSON MATTHEY<|>CLEAN AIR<|>Clean Air is a division of Johnson Matthey that develops emission control technologies<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOHNSON MATTHEY<|>CATALYST TECHNOLOGIES<|>Catalyst Technologies is a division of Johnson Matthey focused on large-scale projects<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOHNSON MATTHEY<|>PERSTORP<|>Johnson Matthey is expanding capacity at its Perstorp facility in Sweden<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOHNSON MATTHEY<|>ROYSTON<|>Johnson Matthey is investing in capacity expansion at its site in Royston, UK<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOHNSON MATTHEY<|>MERCEDEZ-BENZ<|>Johnson Matthey secured all of Mercedes-Benz’s light-duty diesel business in Europe<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOHNSON MATTHEY<|>PIEZO PRODUCTS<|>Johnson Matthey sold Piezo Products in 2023<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOHNSON MATTHEY<|>DIAGNOSTIC SERVICES<|>Johnson Matthey plans to sell Diagnostic Services in 2023<|>5)\n##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
