During \n2022 global economic uncertainty, including increases \nin inflation, has led to increases in central bank \ninterest rates and volatility in bond yields. This \nincreased the sensitivity of past investments to \nimpairment, over which the Committee exercises its \njudgement in undertaking goodwill and other asset \nimpairments. \nA number of impairments have been recognised as at \n31 December 2022 and therefore further judgement \nhas been required in relation to the quantum and \ndisclosure of those impairments. \nThe Committee critically reviewed and discussed management’s \nreports outlining the key assumptions within impairment \nassessments for Bupa's most sensitive CGUs and challenged the \nresults in the light of business performance and the more volatile \nexternal environment. \nThe impacts of increased discount rates, global inflationary \npressures, and certain industry specific pressures on Bupa’s CGUs, \nalong with the impact of the pandemic on future cash flows where \nthis has become clearer, have been key areas of focus within \nmanagement’s analysis and judgements. \nThe Committee considered the appropriateness of impairments \nrecognised in the Bupa Dental Care UK, BVAC Australia, Bupa Care \nServices and Bupa Chile CGUs, along with the disclosure regarding \nthe wider impairment testing undertaken on these specific \nimpairments. The Committee also received a report from the \nExternal Auditor of its views on the assessments performed by \nmanagement. The Committee is satisfied that the assumptions \napplied were reasonable, the impairments recognised were \nmaterially accurate and the carrying value of goodwill and other \nintangible assets as at the reporting date were appropriate. \nInsurance reserves \nCalculation of the outstanding claims provision \nis based on assumptions including claims \ndevelopment, margin of prudence, claims costs \ninflation, and medical trends and seasonality, which \nrequire a high level of judgement and actuarial \nexpertise. Bupa continued to hold additional insurance \nreserves during the year where constructive \nobligations relating to the pandemic required such \nliabilities to be recognised. Where these exist, the \namount and timing of in-scope deferred claims that \nare expected to rebound continue to be a key \njudgement. \nThe Committee considered the appropriateness of the overall level \nof insurance reserves held at key reporting dates. The Committee \nreceived a report from the Chief Actuary setting out estimates of \nthe IFRS insurance reserves, including the consolidated margin of \nprudence and the key assumptions underpinning the deferred \nclaims provision in Australia, as well as the result of the annual \nreview of compliance with Bupa’s Claims Reserving and Liability \nAdequacy Standards. \nThe Committee also took into consideration the External Auditor’s \nreport to the Committee. \nProperty valuations \nBupa has a significant portfolio of care homes, \nhospital and office properties which are revalued to \nfair value on a periodic basis, with external valuations \nundertaken at least triennially. Bupa also has a \nportfolio of investment properties, primarily \nretirement villages in New Zealand. \nIn valuing care home property, a judgement is made \non the highest and best use of the property. The \nunderlying assumptions involved in the valuation \nestimates, including profitability, occupancy levels \nand capitalisation rates and discount rates, are \nsubject to a high level of judgement. \nThe Committee received the results from the external valuations \nundertaken as part of the triennial property review, primarily across \nAustralia, New Zealand and UK properties, and also Directors’ \nvaluations performed in other Business Units. \nThe Committee also reviewed reporting from the External Auditor \naddressing the valuations to assess their reasonableness and \nconsidered the appropriateness of disclosures made. \nThe Committee is satisfied that the revaluation exercise undertaken \nby management is sufficiently robust and that the resultant \nmovements in fair value across the Group’s property portfolio is \nappropriate. \nBupa Annual Report 2022 69 \n \n   \n         \n       \n      \n        \n        \n       \n          \n  \n         \n           \n           \n          \n           \n     \n        \n        \n     \n   \n       \n       \n       \n        \n      \n         \n \n        \n       \n       \n         \n   \n       \n           \n      \n          \n         \n       \n          \n           \n          \n        \n        \n         \n         \n \n        \n            \n      \n  \n    \n         \n       \n \n        \n      \n      \n    \n        \n        \n       \n \n     \n        \n    \n       \n      \n         \n        \n     \n       \n     \n       \n   \n    \n      \n          \n         \n          \n          \n       \n       \n     \n       \n       \n      \n       \n       \n      \n \n      \n        \n       \n       \n        \n       \n      \n       \n       \n          \n        \n       \n       \n         \n        \n        \n       \n     \n          \n   \n   \nStrategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements \nAudit Committee report continued \nKey issue Committee response \nPension assets and liabilities \nBupa’s principal defined benefit scheme in the UK is \nThe Bupa Pension Scheme.
