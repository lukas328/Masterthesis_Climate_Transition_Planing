Any \neventual improvements arising from the messages received \nvia this Channel are reported to the Transparency Committee \nand the Audit and Integrity Committee on a quarterly basis.\nThe effectiveness of the tool is monitored by means of \nfeedback to the users, protocols for the receipt of reports, \nand monitoring and conclusion of the issues classified as \n“justified” or “unjustified”. The performance indicators are \npublished annually by the Compliance Department.\nWe base all of BRF’s operations on the Transparency Guide \nwhich has recently been reviewed (the latest version has \nbeen current since January 1, 2021) and periodic dissemina-\ntion to all employees throughout our markets. As well as this \nwe have a set of policies and procedures (see the table on the \nfollowing page) that address the topics relating to integrity \nby the Compliance Board, and which is applied to all BRF’s \nemployees and partners. \nThe Transparency Guide addresses issues that cover the \nentire business, such as human rights, diversity, conflict \nof interest, tackling corruption and bribery, data privacy, \nand guidance on the use of the transparency channel. The \ndocument meets the requirements and specifications of \napplicable Brazilian and international legislation and publicly \nestablishes BRF’s management of compliance. We are signa-\ntories to the Business Pact for Integrity and Fighting Corrup-\ntion and comply with the annual commitments arising from \nthe signing of the agreement with the cited Institution. The \nsigning performed at the BRF head office (in Santa Catarina) \ncovers all the group’s legal entities.\nThe topic of conflict of interest is addressed through training \nsessions, as well as management policies, and contains basic \nregulations for the operations of the Company's employees \nand managers. In our CORPORATE CONFLICT OF INTEREST \nPolicy, we have a section on “Procedure for declaration in the \nevent of a conflict of interest”, that focuses on the approach \nand handling of cases of this nature. This document can be \naccessed here.\nWe pay special attention to the topics of anti-corruption and \nanti-bribery, in order to guarantee the proper conduct of all \nour directors, employees and business partners in business \ntransactions or relations with public authorities, the private \nsector or society as a whole. \nIn order to maintain our ISO 37001 certification, inspection \naudits were performed in 2021 and 2022, demonstrating the \nrobustness of BRF’s Integrity System in its human, financial \nand technological resources related to anti-bribery practices.\nThis concern also extends to the process of contracting third \nparties, in which our Compliance Board performs reputa-\ntional analyses of partners in hirings that could possibly be \nof high risk to the business, involving consultations of official \npublic blacklists, court processes and the media. The pro-\ncess is also crucial in cases of mergers and acquisitions, in \nwhich careful assessments of the employees examine the \nhistory, practices and compliance of potential companies, \n2022 Integrated  \nReport\nOur way of  \ndoing business\nOur strategy\nCulture and \nEngagement\nValue Generation\nIndicators  \nand annex\n3\n4\n5\n6\n2\nPresentation1\n21\nwithin the sphere of M&A projects. In terms of competition \npractices, we have a management policy specifically ad-\ndressing this matter .\nThe issue of human rights involves our analysis of potential \nand real impacts and of the practices established in the \nIntegrity System and in the Company's risk management \nprocedures, this having been highlighted in the materiality \nprocess and the stakeholder consultation and engagement \nprocess. We have a corporate policy dedicated to the issue \nand, in both our own operations and in those of our sup-\npliers, we observe the risks associated with labor practices \ncomparable to slavery, child labor and degrading work \nconditions. The Transparency Guide directly addresses the \nissue. \nIn 2022, we performed periodic assessments of categories \nconcerning “anti-ethical conduct” and “anti-competition, \ncorruption, export control, money laundering and violation \nof human rights”, in our three operations, or in other words, \n100% of the total, and we pay close attention to risks such \nas non-compliance with the Brazilian Anti-Corruption Law \nand related regulations, as well as the directives of our In-\ntegrity System. GRI 205-1\nIn 2022, no public court cases relating to corruption were \nfiled against BRF or our employees, and nor were any con-\ntracts with our business partners rescinded.
