Joint ventures where we have \na minority share are not included.\nFor the purposes of reporting, separate businesses resident \nat the same location are counted as separate sites. \nData from 76 sites was included in this report, 45 are \nmanufacturing sites, 15 are R&D sites and 16 are offices. \nData from new facilities is included from the point at \nwhich the facility becomes owned by JM and operational.  \n \nSelected non-financial data has been third-party limited \nassured to ISAE 3000 (Revised) standard as described on \npage 228-230. Certain employee data is included in the \nfinancial accounts and is also subject to the financial data \nthird-party audit described on page 133. \nRebaselining of previous years’ data  \nDuring the year we divested several businesses as going \nconcerns, including our Health, Advanced Glass \nTechnologies and our Battery Materials businesses.\nIn accordance with the recommendations of the  \ngreenhouse gas (GHG) Protocol and SECR reporting \nguidance, we have removed their historical contribution \nto our operational KPIs for all years from 2019/20, which \nis our baseline for our 2030 sustainability targets. \nThis specifically includes our historical data for Scope 1, \n2 and 3 GHG emissions, water consumption, waste and \nemissions to air.\nThis report contains only rebaselined numbers.\nIn this section\nBasis of reporting – non-financial data 222\nExternally assured selected information \nby ERM CVS\n228\nIndependent Limited Assurance Statement \nto Johnson Matthey Plc \n229\nShareholder information 231\nCompany details Back \ncover\nBasis of reporting  \n– non-financial data\nThis integrated report has been prepared in accordance \nwith the GRI Standards for the period 1st April 2022 \nto 31st March 2023. Our last annual report was published \nin June 2022. All non-financial performance data is \nreported on a financial year basis unless otherwise stated.\nJohnson Matthey compiles, assesses and discloses non-\nfinancial information to demonstrate to its stakeholders \nthat it conducts its business in an ethical, responsible and \nsustainable manner and where there is a legal obligation \nto do so (for example, in accordance with the UK \nCompanies Act, UK Stream-lined Energy and Carbon \nreporting (SECR) regulations, UK Modern Slavery Act). \nThis report has been developed to incorporate the group’s \nsignificant economic, environmental and social impacts \nand is set within the context of the United Nations \nBrundtland definition of sustainability (1987) and our own \nsustainable business goals to 2030. The principles of \ninclusivity, materiality and responsiveness help to shape \nthe structure of the report and to set priorities for reporting. \nThe report also explains how we continue to build \nsustainability into our business planning and decision-\nmaking processes and how, through our governance \nprocesses, we manage social, environmental and ethical \nmatters across the group.\nRestatements of previous years’ data \nin this report\nIn addition to rebaselining, there have been some  \nrestatements of data to account for improvements \nin methodology, coverage and quality of available data. \nJM’s materiality threshold for variance is 5%. We have made \nrestatements of environmental performance data for the \nfollowing KPIs this year:\n• Scope 3 emissions from investments has been restated \nfollowing the inclusion of our pension-related \ninvestments where JM has appointed a trustee. \n• NOx emissions to Air has been restated following a review \nof the methodology to calculate this KPI. \n• Recycled PGMs restated due to calculation refinements \npost 2021/22 ARA publication. \n• Following a review of the methodologies for calculating \nprocess CO2 emissions and process N20 emissions the \nvalues have been restated for all years from base year \n(2019/20).\nMaterial Topics \nIn July 2022 we partnered with a third party to refresh \nour materiality assessment. They reviewed public domain \nopinions of our investors, customers and social media users, \nas well as interviewing leaders inside JM. Our material \ntopics were identified as:\n• Climate Change\n• Air Emissions \n• Water and wastewater\n• Waste management\n• Circularity and product innovation\n• Health and Safety\n• Human rights\n• Diversity and inclusion\n• Community impact\n• Responsible sourcing\n• Governance and risk management\nThese were approved at the SVC meeting in \nSeptember 2022.\nFor each qualifying JM technology solution, we first determine its functional unit. \nThe functional unit is used to determine the boundary of the analysis, to ensure that the \nscope of the calculation covers the relevant life-cycle stages leading to the avoided emissions. \nPerformance comparisons for our technology solution scenario are then made against \nidentified reference scenarios, which represent current day, conventional technologies \ndominant in the market, which our emerging technologies are seeking to improve upon.\nThe following table gives examples of the JM technology solution families included in this \nKPI and the reference scenarios used for the calculations\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
