This dashboard will \nevolve over time to show potential \ndivergence at a counterparty, sectoral \nand asset class level, to inform where \nwe may need to accelerate our \ndecarbonisation efforts to remain \non track.\nWe recognise that there is a key dependency on \nthe real economy to decarbonise at a similar pace \nto our own decarbonisation activities. If the real \neconomy decarbonises at a significantly different \npace to our investment portfolio, we run the risk  \nof giving our customers a different outcome to  \nthe one they expected as the assets may deviate \nfrom the parent index. As such, we have set in place  \na robust governance process to periodically review \nthe effects of the activities we take, to ensure there \nare no unintended consequences emerging that \ncould be to the detriment of our customers’ \ninterests. If potential detriment were to be \nidentified, we may need to take action to  \nprotect customer outcomes.\nOver time, as we reach our interim decarbonisation \nmilestones, we will set further interim targets on \nthe pathway to net zero by 2050 to maintain \nmomentum, as per Net Zero Asset Owner Alliance \nguidance. In addition, we will review our exclusions \npolicy on an annual basis to ensure alignment with \nour net zero goals and emerging industry guidance.\nTable 7: Phoenix Group approach to GFANZ financing strategies\nGFANZ financing strategy GFANZ financing strategy\nClimate solutions: Entities and activities \nthat develop and scale climate solutions\nWe are seeking to increase our investment in climate solutions \nrequired to deliver net zero. With the necessary conditions, \nsuch as the right regulatory framework and access to \ntransformative investment projects that offer an attractive \nreturns profile, Phoenix could invest up to £40 billion in \nsustainable and/or productive assets to support economic \ngrowth, levelling up and the climate change agenda.\nAligned: Entities that are already \naligned to a 1.5°C pathway\nWe are committed to increasing the proportion of our \ninvestments that are aligned or aligning to a 1.5°C pathway, for \nexample through our customised decarbonising benchmarks \nand stewardship strategy. In 2021, 32% of our listed asset \nportfolio had approved SBTs in place (‘aligned’) and 16% had \ncommitted to SBTs (‘aligning’).\nAligning: Entities committed  \nto transitioning in line with  \n1.5°C-aligned pathways\nManaged phase-out: The accelerated \nmanaged phase-out of high-emitting \nphysical assets\nWhere our investee companies have business models and \nassets that are not consistent with a net zero future, we seek to \ninfluence them through our stewardship engagement to drive \npositive change. In addition, work is ongoing to refine our \ndefinition of sustainable investments and ensure it aligns with \nrecognised taxonomies. This is likely to include a ‘transitional’ \nassets category.\n Monitor and refine continued\nEnhancing an oversight process\n4\nAligning our finance to net zero\nOur approach to decarbonising our investments portfolio broadly aligns with GFANZ’s four key \nfinancing strategies to reduce real-economy emissions: climate solutions, aligned, aligning and \nmanaged phase-out.
