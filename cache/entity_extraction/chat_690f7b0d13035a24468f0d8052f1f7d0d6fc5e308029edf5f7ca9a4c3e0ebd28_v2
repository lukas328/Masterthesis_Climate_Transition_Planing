We then analyze changes in Mizuho’s credit costs by formulating an outlook \nfor the impact on clients’ financial results, based on changes to the parameter under the scenario. \nTargeted \nsectors Electric utilities, oil, gas, coal, steel, and automobile sectors (worldwide) \nPeriod 2050 \nCredit costs \nCumulative increase in the above sectors through 2050 (difference with Current Policies scenario) \nNet Zero 2050: ¥1.2 trillion \nBelow 2°C: ¥60 billion \nDelayed Transition: ¥1.1 trillion  \nImplications \nand \nnecessary \nactions \n The increase in credit costs is the total through 2050, and the impact on the Mizuho group’s finances \nis limited. \n We confirmed the importance of moving forward a rapid and smooth transition (orderly transition) \ntowards a low-carbon society. \n We will further enhance our engagement with clients to support their progress on responding to \nclimate change in an orderly fashion. \n We will conduct scenario analysis accounting for clients ’ transition plans and apply it to more in-\ndepth engagement. \n- Physical risk \nTypes of risk Acute risks Chronic risks \nScenario NGFS Current Policies and Net Zero 2050 (1.5°C) \nscenarios \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \n(IPCC) 4  Representative Concentration \nPathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario (4°C scenario) / \nRCP 2.6 scenario (2°C scenario) \nAnalysis \nmethod \nWe used a Monte Carlo simulation to calculate the \nimpacts of wind- and water-related damages from \ntyphoons and other storms.  \nFor direct impacts (impacts on asset value), we \nanalyzed damage to Mizuho group assets \n(buildings, equipment) and credit costs from loss \nor damage of mortgaged real estate.  \nFor indirect impacts (impacts of business \nstagnation), we analyzed credit costs from \nbusiness stagnation among our clients due to \nwind- and water-related damage. \nWe analyzed the impacts on credit costs from \nchanges in the macroeconomic environment \nbrought about by increases in infectious \ndisease (e.g. malaria, dengue) and heatstroke \nas well as by heatstroke prevention practices \ncausing concomitant decreases in summer \nworking hours among outdoor laborers. \nTargets of \nanalysis \nJapan only, for impact of business stagnation this \nis based on the location of the company’s \nheadquarters (this analysis targeted middle  \nmarket firms and SMEs). \nJapan only \nDamage \ncosts / credit \ncosts \nCurrent Policies: Asset value impact of ¥70 billion, \nbusiness stagnation impact of ¥130 billion, both \ntotal figures through 2100. \nRCP 8.5: Up to a total of ¥4 billion through \n2100. \nImplications The analysis confirmed that there will not be a significant impact compared to our income during the \nperiod. \n \n \npp. 39 – 44 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npp. 45 – 47 \n \n  \n                                         \n3 A network of central banks and financial supervisors addressing issues such as climate change risk.
