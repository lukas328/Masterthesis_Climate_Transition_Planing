BBVA has taken on the goal of \nbeing emission-neutral by 2050, has set \nthe goal to stop financing coal by 2030 in \ndeveloped countries and by 2040 in the rest \nof the geographies where it operates (in \nthe terms of its Environmental and Social \nFramework), and has set intermediate \ntargets for 2030 to decarbonize its portfolio \nin the electricity generation, oil & gas, autos, \nsteel and cement sectors and in part of its \nBBVA Asset Management portfolio. See \nMANAGEMENT OF RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH  \nCLIMATE CHANGE .\nLikewise, BBVA has also developed industry-\nspecific plans with the development of a \ntransition risk management framework \nand the construction of tools such as a \ntransition risk indicator at client level and \nfor sectors classified as high transition \nrisk, which allows the incorporation of a \nmedium and long-term vision regarding the \nlevel of preparedness of companies to face \nthe decarbonization process. Additionally, \na new metric was incorporated into the \n2023 management limits, with a transition \nrisk management approach, by focusing \non customers with a level of misalignment \nwith respect to the emissions intensity \ntrajectories established by the International \nEnergy Agency’s Net Zero Emissions \nscenario, as indicated in the section \nMANAGEMENT OF RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH  \nCLIMATE CHANGE .\nLastly, it is worth to mention that the Bank \nhas a strong presence in international \ninitiatives and indexes worldwide, \nhighlighting the highest score (86 points) \nobtained in 2022 among the banks in \nEurope and the second at global level in the \nlast Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) \n(see  Main advances in the execution of the strategy  \nsection).\nPioneers in sustainability\n \nSustainability has a long history at BBVA, \nsince it participated in the first green bond \nissue in 2007 .
