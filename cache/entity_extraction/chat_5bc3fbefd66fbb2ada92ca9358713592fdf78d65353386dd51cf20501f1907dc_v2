Sustainability was embedded in \nthe Group’s strategic plan in 2019. \nFor the Board of Directors, an essential \nelement of this strategic approach is the \nintegration of sustainability into the Group’s \nbusinesses and activities, managing the risks \nassociated with these areas, and considering \nthem a great business opportunity to \nsupport its growth strategy. Combined \nwith this is the establishment of targets \nwhich facilitate their execution, supervision \nand monitoring. This approach allows the \nGroup’s corporate bodies to define the \nbasic lines of action for BBVA as regards \nthe management of opportunities and risks \narising from sustainability and oversee \ntheir execution by the executive areas in all \nspheres of the Entity’s operations.\nFor this role, the Board is assisted by \nits committees on matters within their \nrespective areas of concern. The Executive \nCommittee plays an active role in promoting \nthis strategy and monitoring the integration \nof sustainability into the Group’s business \nprocesses and activities. \nAlso important is the role of the Risk and \nCompliance Committee, which assists \nthe Board of Directors in the integration \nof sustainability in the analysis, planning \nand management of the Group’s risks, and \nin supervising their execution; that of the \nAudit Committee, in supervising the public \ninformation on sustainability reported to the \nmarket; and the Remuneration Committee, \nin driving the integration of indicators related \nto sustainability in the Group’s variable \nremuneration model.\nIn the exercise of these functions, in \n2022 the Board approved the update of \nthe General Sustainability Policy, which \nintegrates the previous Corporate Social \nResponsibility Policy and the General \nSustainability Policy. The new policy sets \nout the general principles and the key \nmanagement and control objectives and \nguidelines to be followed by the Group in \nterms of sustainable development with a \nfocus on climate change, natural capital and \ninclusive growth.\nIn addition to this, there is the role of the \ncorporate supervisory and monitoring \nbodies for the implementation of the \nGroup’s sustainability strategy and activity, \nand compliance with the organization’s \nobjectives, which is carried out based on the \nreports received by the Sustainability Area \nand the different areas of the Bank which \nincorporate sustainability into their daily \nbusinesses and activities. The reports are \nsubmitted to the corporate bodies according \nto their area of concern along the lines \ndescribed in the preceding paragraphs, on a \nscheduled or ad hoc basis.\nT o achieve the best performance of its \nfunctions in this area, the Board of Directors \nbelieves it necessary to have suitable \nknowledge and experience in sustainability \nmatters. T o this end, it continues to conduct \ninitiatives that involve the recruitment, \nwithin the process of gradual replacement \nits members, of directors with extensive \nknowledge and experience in these matters, \nand in the extension of the continuous \ntraining program of its members to matters \nrelated to sustainability.\nP.  20\nBBVA Report on TCFD 2022\nThis English version is a translation of the original in Spanish for information purposes only.
