Meanwhile, for the thermal \ncoal sector, we chose to adopt a target for phasing \nout the sector. \nco²\n31 \nItaú Unibanco Holding S.A.climate report 2022\nDecarbonization of the Power Generation \nportfolio\nThe electricity sector is an essential economic and \nsocial development inducer for the growth of GDP \nand improvement of people’s quality of life. The \npower generated by renewable energy sources, such as \nhydroelectricity, solar, wind, biomass, among others, is also \nessential for sustainable development. \nConcerns about energy security and climate change have \nbeen making governments establish energy policies that \npromote energy efficiency and the diversification of \nthe matrix with a greater share of renewable sources in \npower generation as solutions to mitigate greenhouse \ngas emissions. \nFor example, in accordance with the National Energy \nBalance 2022, wind and solar mills grew 21.2% and 40.9% \nin the 2021-2020 comparison, which represents 11.4% \nand 2.5% of the installed capacity, respectively. If we \ninclude hydroelectric, biomass and Small Hydroelectric \nPlant (PCHs) sources, 82% of the Brazilian energy matrix \nconsists of renewable energy, placing Brazil in a privileged \nposition in the decarbonization of this sector. This gives \nBrazil the opportunity to be one of the first countries in the \nworld to have an energy matrix with zero greenhouse gas \nnet emissions.  \nAs the bank of the transition, we prioritize power \ngeneration for the establishment of the first sector \ndecarbonization target. The activity is relevant for \nour portfolio – R$60 billion when including exposure in \nall activities related to the power generation sector and \nR$ 28 billion of exposure in power generation, the focus \nof the target – and it is critical for the decarbonization \nof the economy as a whole, since the use of renewable \nenergy sources is a key step towards the decarbonization \nof other sectors of the economy, such as transport and \nmanufacturing. Additionally, there is the expectation \nof growth in the global electric energy demand in the \ncoming years. In Brazil, an average growth of 3% per year is \nexpected, according to the National Energy Plan (PNE) 2050. \nBy supporting the decarbonization of this activity, we are \nalso contributing to the decarbonization of the scope 2 of \nour entire client portfolio.\nBased on the Net Zero Scenario by 2050 of the \nInternational Energy Agency (IEA), in line with the Paris \nAgreement, we defined a reduction target of 63% of \nfinanced greenhouse gas emissions intensity for the power \ngeneration sector. The scenario takes into consideration \nthe efforts necessary to maintain the increase of the global \ntemperature by 1.5oC and leads the sector to Net Zero in \n2040. Once this target is reached, the intensity of emissions \nfrom our portfolio will drop from 103 gCO₂e/kWh in 2021 \nto 38 gCO₂e/kWh in 2030. The target includes exposure in \nCorporate Finance and Project Finance that provide for a \nfinanced emissions calculation methodology both in Brazil \nand in the international units in which we operate.\nFinanced emissions intensity target\nSector Power Generation\nScenario IEA Net Zero\nCoverage of emissions Scope 1\n2021 baseline 103 gCO2e/kWh\n2030 emissions target 38 gCO2e/kWh\nReduction % (2030) 63%\n2040 emissions target 0 gCO2e/kWh\nReduction % (2040) 100%\n32 \nItaú Unibanco Holding S.A.climate report 2022\nDefinition of the baseline\nAs mentioned before, we adopt robust criteria for defining \nour emissions baseline. Based on the measurement of \nfinanced emissions, we identified the energy generation \ncompanies in our client portfolio and use the energy \ngeneration (MWh) and GHG emissions (tCO₂e) data of each \ncustomer individually.\nThe baseline presents a PCAF score of 2.47 . We also opted \nfor a conservative approach in the calculation of financed \nemissions, using the sum of equity and banking liabilities \nof the companies in the calculation of the Enterprise Value \nIncluding Cash (EVIC), which makes the amount less subject \nto market fluctuations and avoids the inclusion of volatility \nof external factors in the calculation of financed emissions. \nTaking into consideration that methodological approaches \nmay be adopted in the calculation of the baseline and \ndefinition of decarbonization targets, we reinforce that \nthe disclosures from different financial institutions are \nnot directly comparable and, if they are made, they must \nconsider the differences of methodology and scope of the \ndata disclosed.\nImplementation of the target\nTo make the achievement of this reduction viable, the \nclients in our energy portfolio must be committed to the \ntransition to a low-carbon economy. By means of financial \ninstruments and products that finance the transition \nand increase the participation of renewable energy, we \nsupport these clients in their decarbonization trajectory \nthat is in line with the Paris Agreement.\nOur challenge is to engage the clients that still use sources \nwith higher GHG emissions intensity for the generation of \nelectric energy and that currently concentrate most of the \nemissions from our power generation portfolio. Another \nchallenge, as a bank with international operations, is to \nensure that the climate transition takes place quickly and \nequally in the regions where we operate,\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
