Of the total tax \nlosses, £30 million (2022: £41 million) is expected to expire within 5 years, £30 million \nwithin 5 to 10 years (2022: £12 million), £nil after 10 years (2022: £38 million) and £25 \nmillion carry no expiry (2022: £43 million). These deferred tax assets have not been \nrecognised on the basis that their future economic benefit is not probable. \nIn addition, the group’s overseas subsidiaries have net unremitted earnings of £933 million \n(2022: £820 million), resulting in temporary differences of £563 million (2022: £585 \nmillion). No deferred tax has been provided in respect of these differences since the timing of \nthe reversals can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not \nreverse in the foreseeable future. \nThe recognition of deferred tax assets has been determined by the recoverability of those \nassets against future tax liabilities as determined by budgets and plans that are showing profits \nin relevant businesses. The majority of the deferred tax assets and liabilities noted above are \nanticipated to be realised after more than 12 months. \n24 Post-employment benefits \nGroup \nBackground \nPension plans \nThe group operates a number of post-employment retirement and medical benefit plans \naround the world.
