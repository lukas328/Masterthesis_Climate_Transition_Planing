However, businesses \ncan seek approval from the Chief Actuary to discount in exceptional circumstances. It is expected that Bupa \nAcıbadem Sigorta will apply discounting to both the LFRC and LFIC due to the high interest rate and high inflation \nenvironment in Türkiye. The LFRC for the legacy individual health policies in Brazil will be discounted due to the \nlong-term nature of these contracts. Where discounting is applied, the Group policy is to use European Insurance \nand Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) specified discount rates. \nFor groups of contracts where all contracts have a coverage period of one year or less, the Group has taken the \npolicy decision available to expense insurance acquisition cash flows as incurred. Where the contracts within a \ngroup have a coverage period that is greater than one year, this policy choice is not available and these amounts \nare deferred over the renewal period. \nOn transition, IFRS 17 should be applied retrospectively and the alternative approaches set out in the standard \nshould only be used when retrospective application is impracticable. Due to the short-term nature of Bupa’s \ncontracts, with most contracts measured using the PAA, Bupa will apply the fully retrospective approach in all \ncases except for the legacy individual health policies in Brazil, where a fair value approach will be used. \nBy applying the PAA and taking the policy choices set out above, the Group’s revenue recognition is consistent \nwith that used under IFRS 4. The Group’s net assets at transition on 1 January 2022 are reduced by an estimated \n£55m. This is due to the derecognition of deferred acquisition costs assets and the recognition of loss component \non onerous contracts, offset by the derecognition of both deferred claims liabilities and the premium deferral \nprovision in our Australian insurance business, as these are not included under IFRS 17. The requirements of IFRS 17 \nmean the reduced premium received from customers is recognised on a passage of time basis over the coverage \nperiod and the premium deferral provision is derecognised. \nThe Group’s implementation project is well progressed, and the Group is well prepared for the reporting \nrequirements from 1 January 2023 onwards. \n(b) IAS 1 amendments \nIn February 2021, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued Disclosure of Accounting Policies \n(Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2) to help improve accounting policy disclosures for the \nprimary users of financial statements. Entities must disclose material accounting policies, rather than the current \nrequirement to disclose significant accounting policies, and the concept of materiality in the context of accounting \npolicies is further defined. The amendments are effective from 1 January 2023. The application of these \namendments is currently being evaluated by the Group. The amendments are expected to impact Group \ndisclosures, but have no impact on recognition or measurement. \n(c) IAS 8 amendments \nDefinition of Accounting Estimates (Amendments to IAS 8) was issued by the IASB in February 2021. The \namendments introduce the definition of accounting estimates and include further amendments to help entities \ndistinguish changes in accounting estimates from changes in accounting policies. The amendments are effective \nfrom 1 January 2023. These amendments are not expected to have a material impact on the Group. \n(d) IAS 12 amendments \nIn May 2021, the IASB issued Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction \n(Amendments to IAS 12) removing an existing deferred tax recognition exemption for transactions that give \nrise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences on initial recognition. A lessee’s recognition of assets \nand liabilities on inception of a lease is potentially such a transaction, depending on applicable tax law. The \namendments are effective from 1 January 2023. These amendments are not expected to have a material impact \non the Group. \n(e) Other \nA number of other amendments to standards and interpretations have been issued and are not yet effective \nfor the year ended 31 December 2022. None of these are expected to have a material impact on the Group. \nBupa Annual Report 2022 130 \n         \n               \n                  \n                  \n                   \n                     \n                     \n                \n                  \n              \n                 \n                   \n                \n              \n              \n              \n \n                   \n                   \n                 \n                   \n                 \n      \n                   \n                   \n                         \n                   \n                  \n                 \n   \n          \n      \n   \nStrategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements \nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \ncontinued \n1.7 IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies \nTürkiye is now a hyperinflationary economy and IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies is \nrequired to be applied from June 2022 onwards.
