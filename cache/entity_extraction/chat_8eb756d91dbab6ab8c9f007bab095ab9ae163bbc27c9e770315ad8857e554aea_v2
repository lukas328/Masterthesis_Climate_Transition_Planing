Following the Company’s strategic review, the Committee spent time discussing \nJohnson Matthey’s vision for sustainability and its importance in everything we do. Since her \nappointment as our first Chief Sustainability Officer in May 2022, Anne Chassagnette has \nworked closely with the Committee. Her in-depth experience in leading sustainable \ntransitions has been a great resource for our discussions.\nWe ensure our sustainability goals and targets are focused on the areas where JM can have \nthe greatest positive impact on society. Having updated our materiality assessment and in \nlight of our refreshed strategy, the Committee recommended our 2030 goals be reorganised \nunder two pillars, ‘Planet’ and ‘People’ and focus on ten public targets. \nAs part of our ongoing review and monitoring of climate impacts, we approved a raised climate \nambition to put us firmly on SBTi’s .5˚C pathway to net zero for 2029/30. This commits us \nto reducing Scope 1+2 and Scope 3 emissions by 42% by 2030, compared to 2019/20 levels.\nCreating and embedding a sustainable culture across all areas of JM is hugely important. \nDiversity, inclusion and belonging is key to executing our strategy, leading to more innovation, \nhigh-performing teams and helping us attract and retain talent. During the year we reviewed \nprogress and provided feedback on the roadmap to achieve our diversity and inclusion goals. \nWe approved a standalone human rights policy, which defines our commitments to, and our \nexpectations from, our colleagues and value chain partners.\nAt JM we uphold the highest ethical standards in everything we do, underpinned by our value, \nacting with integrity. The Committee is regularly updated on the plans and actions to embed \nan ethical culture. We discuss ethical dilemmas that arise and are briefed on notable ethics \nand compliance trends. The ethical dilemmas review actual JM fact patterns and provide recent \nexamples of how we live by our values. We confront geopolitical and ethical issues involving \nsanctions and export controls on the world stage. This includes specific commercial opportunities \nwhere we have chosen to walk away, because they did not comply with our business ethics. \nThe world is changing rapidly and as a committee, we need to consider different external \nperspectives, trends and the industry landscape. Through presentations and discussions with \nboth internal and external experts, the Committee is kept informed of new developments and \nbest practice in relevant areas under the societal value remit. During the year, we deepened \nrelationships with external associations and think tanks, committed to advancing sustainable \nbusiness priorities through presentations and discussions on global human rights, the EU plan \nfor hydrogen and the impact of the US Inflation Reduction Act. \nThe Committee has been impressed with progress made this year on embedding the sustainability \nstrategy, driving the diversity and inclusion agenda, and ensuring high standards of ethical conduct.\nOur internal committee effectiveness review showed that the Committee continues \nto operate effectively and has become more embedded into our governance framework. \nJane Griffiths\nSocietal Value Committee Chair\nSocietal Value Committee report\n“Our sustainability  \ntargets and goals are \nfocused on the areas \nwhere we can make a \nreal difference.”\nMembership\nThe Committee comprises all members of the Board.\n Members’ attendance at committee meetings during the year is on page 75\nRegular attendees at committee meetings\n• Chief Sustainability Officer\n• Chief HR Officer\n• General Counsel and Company Secretary\n• Group Sustainability Director\n• Group Head of Ethics and Compliance\n• Corporate Affairs Director\n  The Committee’s Terms of Reference set out its full responsibilities  \nmatthey.com/governance-framework\nSustainability disclosures\nThe Committee reviewed and recommended to the Board the approval of the disclosures \nin the Sustainability report on pages 20 to 44, including our TCFD disclosures on \npages 45 to 52.\n Sustainability Performance Data Book: matthey.com/sustainability-databook\nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 202388\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION\nThe Committee’s role\nSocietal value covers a range of economic, social and environmental topics.
