The municipality decided to redesign it, and Wavin offered the solution to mitigate \nflooding and water shortages during dry periods. \nRegular attenuation systems sit empty most of the time and infiltration systems are only \npossible with the right soil conditions. Wavin’s StormHarvester, using AquaCell® units, is now \nchanging the rules of the game. When rain is  forecast, the system’s predictive technology \nautomatically adjusts the water level within the tank, to ensure it has sufficient capacity for \nrainwater retention. This ensures that the tanks always have capacity to capture stormwater \nand enables the city to  reuse the water continuously for green areas and to combat heat \nstress.\nCircular Solutions for Dairy Farms\nNetafim has developed an award-winning technology reducing the environmental impact \nof dairy farms. Netafim’s subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) system recycles organic waste \ngenerated by dairy cows, optimizing levels of fresh water to fertilize and irrigate feed crops \nwhile eliminating the need for chemical fertilizers. This innovative technology benefits \nthe environment in numerous ways: healthier soil and root environment; concurrent \nconservation of water, nutrients and energy; GHG emissions reduction, and improved crop \nyield.\nApplied in pilot projects in Italy and the United States, this solution represents a major \nachievement for advancing circularity in the agricultural industry, reducing CO2e emissions  \nof dairy operations by 47% compared to traditional methods. \nFor further information:\nOrbia Sustainable Solutions Report \n \nOrbia 2021 Sustainability Report\nLi-Ion Battery Performance and Circularity\nKoura continues to advance its comprehensive energy materials strategy, including \ndevelopment of next-generation electrolyte additives and co-solvents under the Koflyte® \nbrand. Milestones in 2021 include the acquisition of battery tech start-up Silatronix and \ninvestment in Ascend Elements, a closed-loop lithium-ion battery recycler. \nNext-Generation Refrigerants\nFollowing the launch of Klea® 473A, Koura continued to revolutionize the refrigerant gas \nspace with the launch of another of its next-generation refrigerants, Klea® 456A. This lower \nglobal-warming-potential (GWP) refrigerant presents an alternative to R-134a for automotive \nair conditioning systems. Klea® 456A refrigerant is non-flammable and has a GWP 46% \nlower when compared to R-134a.\nIntroduction Governance Strategy Risk Management Metrics and Targets\nOrbia 2021 Climate Report\n16\nTransitioning to renewable and lower carbon energy sources\nOur renewable energy consumption increased by 28% in 2021, driven by key projects across most of our business \ngroups. As an example, our Dura-Line plant in Goa, India, formalized a Power Purchasing Agreement (PPA) to acquire \n1,000 MWh per year of solar power from the second semester of 2021. This represents 12-15% of Goa’s annual \nelectrical load. Our Wavin operations increased use of renewables by 43% in in 2021. Wavin sites in Europe aim to \nsource 100% of their electricity consumption from renewable sources by 2025, a 4% reduction of Orbia’s total GHG \nemissions. \nOur Alphagary’s Melton Mowbray site signed an agreement with a UK utility facility that supplies renewable electricity, \nreducing CO2 emissions by 3,000 tons.\nA trigeneration plant initiated operations in our Vestolit Altamira I site. From 2021, yearly carbon emissions are \nexpected to decline by almost 20,000 tons of CO2e, which would equate to removing over 4,500 cars from the road.\nOptimizing processes, improving efficiencies\nAt Vestolit’s Altamira site, technology adaptations and investments in additional condensers allowed the site to \nreplace chilled water by cooling water in the PVC process. The projected energy consumption reduction is 50 KWh \nper ton of PVC produced and\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ORBIA<|><organization<|>Orbia is a global company focused on developing sustainable solutions across various sectors including agriculture, building, infrastructure, and data communications, with investments in green technologies and climate resilience initiatives.>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VERDAGY<|><organization<|>Verdagy is a company innovating in water electrolysis technology for large-scale green hydrogen production, with investments from Orbia Ventures.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OSMOSES<|><organization<|>Osmoses is a startup developing advanced molecular filters for chemical separations, applicable to carbon capture and blue hydrogen production, with investments from Orbia Ventures.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NETAFIM<|><organization<|>Netafim is a company specializing in subsurface drip irrigation systems that recycle organic waste, reducing environmental impact and greenhouse gas emissions in dairy farms, with pilot projects in Italy and the US.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KOURA<|><organization<|>Koura is a company advancing energy materials including next-generation electrolyte additives and lithium-ion battery recycling, with milestones in electrolyte development and battery recycling investments.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DURA-LINE<|><organization<|>Dura-Line is a company that formalized a Power Purchasing Agreement to acquire solar power, contributing to renewable energy consumption in its operations in Goa, India.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WAVIN<|><organization<|>Wavin is a provider of indoor climate systems and stormwater management solutions, increasing renewable energy use in its European operations to meet sustainability targets.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALPHAGARY<|><organization<|>Alphagary is a company that signed an agreement with a UK utility to source renewable electricity, reducing CO2 emissions at its Melton Mowbray site.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VESTOLIT<|><organization<|>Vestolit is a company operating a trigeneration plant at its Altamira site, implementing energy efficiency measures to reduce carbon emissions by nearly 20,000 tons of CO2e annually.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASSEN<|><geo<|>\"The central square of Assen in the Netherlands is prone to flooding during heavy rainfall, prompting redesign efforts to improve water resilience.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NETHERLANDS<|><geo<|>The country where the city of Assen is located, experiencing frequent flooding issues in its central square.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WAVIN<|><organization<|>Wavin offers the StormHarvester system with AquaCell® units to mitigate flooding and water shortages in Assen, Netherlands, enhancing urban resilience.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NETAFIM<|><organization<|>Netafim developed subsurface drip irrigation technology that recycles organic waste, reducing dairy farm environmental impact and greenhouse gas emissions.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ITALY<|><geo<|>Country where pilot projects using Netafim's circular irrigation solutions are implemented.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNITED STATES<|><geo<|>Country where additional pilot projects using Netafim's circular irrigation solutions are conducted.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SILATRONIX<|><organization<|>Silatronix is a battery technology startup acquired by Koura, focusing on electrolyte additives for lithium-ion batteries.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASCEND ELEMENTS<|><organization<|>Ascend Elements is a company investing in closed-loop lithium-ion battery recycling, part of Koura's energy materials strategy.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KLEA® 473A<|><organization<|>Klea® 473A is a next-generation refrigerant launched by Koura with lower GWP as an alternative to R-134a.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KLEA® 456A<|><organization<|>Klea® 456A is a low-GWP, non-flammable refrigerant introduced by Koura, reducing GWP by 46% compared to R-134a.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOA<|><geo<|>State in India where Dura-Line's plant formalized a solar PPA, contributing to renewable energy use.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INDIA<|><geo<|>Country where Goa is located, and where Dura-Line's renewable energy project is based.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DURA-LINE<|><organization<|>Dura-Line is a company that formalized a solar power PPA in Goa, India, to increase renewable energy consumption.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WAVIN<|><organization<|>Wavin is increasing renewable energy use in its European operations, aiming for 100% renewable electricity by 2025.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALPHAGARY<|><organization<|>Alphagary is a company that signed an agreement with a UK utility to source renewable electricity, reducing CO2 emissions.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VESTOLIT<|><organization<|>Vestolit operates a trigeneration plant at its Altamira site, implementing energy efficiency measures to reduce carbon emissions.\")\n##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
