Examples of elements in thermal coal policies\nKEY ELEMENTS INDUSTRY EXAMPLES\nScope NZBA: “Any client with more than 5% of their revenues coming directly from thermal coal mining, \nand electricity generation activities shall be included in the scope of targets.” 145\nSBTi: “Coal companies are defined as companies with greater than 5% of revenues from thermal \ncoal mining, exploration and drilling, mining services, processing, trading, transport and logistics, \nequipment manufacturing, operations and maintenance services, engineering, procurement and \nconstruction services, transmission and distribution of coal-fired electricity, coal to liquids and \ncoal to gas.”146 \nConditions Axa: “An engagement initiative was launched targeting issuers which are exposed to coal but are \nbelow our exclusion thresholds, to inform them of our decision, and ask them to define robust \ntransition plans, implementing Science-Based Carbon Reduction targets and Transition Pathways \nin line with the Paris Agreement’s +1.5 degree C ambition, and report regularly on progress.” 147\nBank of America:  “Unless those facilities employ technology that is focused on complete or near \nelimination of atmospheric carbon emissions, such as carbon capture technology.” 148\nMitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. (MUFG): “Coal-fired power generations equipped with \ncarbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS), mixed combustion, and other technologies \nnecessary to achieve the Paris Agreement target may be considered on an individual basis.” 149 \nIMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY\nCONTENTS  |  FINANCIAL INSTITUTION NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLANS — FUNDAMENTALS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND GUIDANCE\n55\nKEY ELEMENTS INDUSTRY EXAMPLES\nExclusions Credit Agricole:  “The Bank will not participate in dedicated financing for the development of new \ncoal-fired power plants or their expansions, regardless of the country.” 150\nNZAOA: “Other than coal plants currently under active construction, no further thermal coal \npower plants should be financed, insured, built, developed or planned. There should be an \nimmediate cancellation of all new thermal coal projects, including thermal coal plant, coal mines \nand related infrastructure (i.e., supplying products or services to thermal coal-based projects or \nbusiness models) that are in pre-construction phase.” 151\nPAII NZIF: “It is recommended that investors should not allocate additional capital to companies \nwhich are planning or constructing new thermal coal projects and associated infrastructure \n(power, mining).”152 \nTimeline Citigroup Inc (Citi): “It is our expectation that such strategies will align with Paris Agreement \ndecarbonization pathways by 2030 (for clients with power generation in OECD countries) and  \nby 2040 (for clients with power generation in non-OECD countries).” 153\nCredit Agricole: “For the continuation of financial services from 2021, the Bank expects its \nclients to develop and communicate to it an [sic] phasing out plan in line with the timetable \nrecommended by climate science (2030 for EU and OECD countries and 2040 for the rest of the \nworld), including a commitment not to develop new projects.” 154 \nIA ICAPs: “A clear position should be developed on engaging high emitting investments \n(including adopting a formal fossil fuel policy), consistent with any climate pledges made. [ …] \ninvestors should adopt a robust and science-based policy for the organization in relation to fossil \nfuel phaseout. This policy may also recognize the need for a just transition in countries or regions \nwhere there is significant dependence on thermal coal power or mining and reflect regional \ndifferences in speed of phaseout consistent with 1.5 degree C scenarios.” 155 \nIEA: The Net Zero Emissions (NZE) scenario involves the phaseout of unabated coal power plants \nin advanced economies by 2030 and globally by 2040. 156 \nPPCA: Requires phase-out on science-based timelines to meet Paris, with specific dates set in the \nPPCA Declaration. 157\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
