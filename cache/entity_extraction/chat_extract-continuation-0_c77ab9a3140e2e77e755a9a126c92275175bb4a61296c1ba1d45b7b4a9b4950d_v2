At this meeting the committee had a \ndetailed discussion on methodologies and sector transition plans, including \nimpact of climate-related risks and opportunities, as well as our policy \ninfluencing strategy given a dependency on clear and early government \npolicy intervention.\nThe committee considered a purpose management information dashboard \nat every meeting which provided a snapshot of progress against key \npurpose metrics and targets. It also considered performance against \nclimate-related executive targets and provided advice to the Group \nPerformance and Remuneration Committee on the setting of future \nclimate-related targets for remuneration purposes.\nIn April, the committee received an update on broader environmental \npolicy and progress covering nature and biodiversity.
