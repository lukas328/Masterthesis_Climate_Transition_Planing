We have principally achieved this through energy efficiency and \nrenewable electricity procurement, although we did also have an overall drop in production \noutput due to COVID-related disruptions to the automotive industry in China.\nOverall our GHG emissions from Scope 3 purchased goods and services decreased by 16% \nin 2022/23 compared to the previous year, and we reached our previous target for 2030 \nseven years early. This was achieved through a combination of reduced procurement of \nprimary PGM and through the decarbonisation efforts of our supply chain partners in the \nPGM mining sector.\nNon-renewable, grid-supplied electricity  \nCertified renewable electricity from the grid  \nRenewable electricity generated locally  \nNatural gas used on site  \nOther fossil fuels used on site  \nNon-renewable steam procured  \nFuel used on public roads by JM vehicles \non company business  \n21.8%\n16.2% \n0.6%\n52.2%\n5.8% \n3.0% \n0.4%\nEnergy mix\nTotal: 1,185,612 MWh\nPlanet: Protecting the climate continued\nEnergy efficiency and security\nTo ensure we drive energy efficiency in our operations, and underpin our net zero strategy, \nthis year we worked with a third-party provider to create an energy management framework for \nthe whole business in line with ISO 50001. Training relating to this was provided through global \nsessions along with focused training to our most energy-intensive sites. Four sites already have \nISO 50001 and we have completed our gap analysis for another 16 of our largest sites. \nImplementation of recommendations has already started, and will continue in the year ahead. \nFor example, at our largest energy-using site, through process and control improvements on \ntwo of their larger assets, we were able to demonstrate savings of approximately 2% of the site’s \ntotal fuel consumption. At our UK refinery, we are carrying out feasibility and heat studies to \nlook at how they can recover more energy. Three of our largest manufacturing sites also make \nelectricity using combined heat and power plants (CHPs) to optimise our energy efficiency. \nAlthough these run off natural gas, our CHPs generated 26,974 MWh (5.6% of our total) \nelectricity this year minimising our energy demand.\nWe established a Winter Energy Taskforce to focus and co-ordinate our efforts to mitigate \nthe risk to our operation from headwinds in the energy markets created by the Ukraine war. \nWe minimised energy cost rises to 82%. We continue to focus on measures to improve our \nresilience at key locations, including beginning negotiations on direct supply of electricity \nthrough power purchase agreements (PPA). \nRenewable energy\nThis year 41% of our electricity consumption came from certified renewable sources, compared \nto 32% in 2021/22. We remain on track to achieve our target of purchasing 60% of our \nelectricity from certified renewable sources by 2025.\nOver the past year we assessed additional renewable energy procurement opportunities and the \ninherent risks, challenges, gaps or legal changes that may occur along our journey to net zero. \nCurrently we are using green tariffs to ensure renewable electricity consumption in Europe and \nthe US, and going forward we will focus on Power and Renewable Gas Purchase Agreements \nin these regions and others where this procurement scheme is available. \nIn regions like India and China we will continue to purchase recognised Energy Attribute \nCertificates in the short term. We have also deployed some on-site generation as part of the \ncurrent energy portfolio in sites in India.\nScope 1\nScope 2\nScope 3 – Purchased goods and services\nScope 3 – All other categories\n7.1%\n3.9% \n75.4%\n13.6%\nTotal greenhouse gas emissions\nTotal: 3.3million tonnes CO2e\n  For more information on our calculation methodology \nplease see our Basis of reporting on pages 222-227\nIncreasing our energy efficiency with no additional investment\nWe are always exploring ways to improve our energy efficiency. Our Clean Air site in Poland \ndemonstrates the kind of positive results that can be achieved through innovative thinking \nand process optimisation. Through adding new logic controls to our existing systems, we \nhave enabled waste heat recirculation from downstream zones of the ovens to upstream \nzones. We expect this improvement to reduce annual fuel usage on our site by about 10% \nwithout the need for any additional capital investment. We are replicating this low-cost \nimprovement across other Clean Air sites globally, with similar savings expected.  \nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 2023 27\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION\nSustainability continued\nScope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint and energy efficiency\n2022/23 2021/221\nGlobal UK only Global (excl UK)\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
