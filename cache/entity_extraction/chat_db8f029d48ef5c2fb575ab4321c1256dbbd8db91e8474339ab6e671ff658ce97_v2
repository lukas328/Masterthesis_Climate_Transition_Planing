(i) Our purpose outlined above and on page 8 demonstrates that, as a \ncontinued healthcare company, we are particularly aware of the inextricable link \nB. Describe the between the health of the planet, climate change, human health and \nimpact of \nclimate risks \nhealthcare. The addition of ‘and making a better world’ to our purpose, \nin 2021, establishes the broader role we expect to play in the health of \nand our people and planet and in how we deliver healthcare. \nopportunities \non the \norganisation’s \nbusiness, \nstrategy and \nplanning \n(ii) Sustainability is a strategic pillar of our 3x6 strategy. Our sustainability \nstrategy was developed to provide a framework for the business to focus \ninvestment and accelerate action where the business can have the greatest \nimpact, at the intersection of climate and health, recognising that to look \nafter people’s health means looking after the health of the planet too. \nSee page 22 for more information. \n(iii) As reported on page 24 as part of our Mission Zero update, we have \ncommitted to become a net zero business by 2040, underpinned by our \n1.5°C aligned science-based targets, and demonstrated via our membership \nof the UN-backed Race to Zero campaign. To date, scope 1 and 2 priorities \nhave been integrated into three year business planning cycles. These, \nalongside wider net zero priorities, will be further integrated into business \nand financial decision-making in 2023, to ensure that the necessary \ndecarbonisation initiatives, aligned to meeting these targets, are prioritised \nand funded. This transition will be further enabled through leadership \nengagement and training across the organisation. As detailed on page 22, \nin 2022 we launched the Sustainability Academy within Bupa, starting with \nupskilling leadership and priority functions on climate-related issues. In \naddition to developing the Academy curriculum for all employees in 2023, \nwe will also focus on maturing our approach to research, collaboration and \ninnovation as part of the delivery of our sustainability strategy and net \nzero by 2040 target. As mentioned above, in 2023 we will be undertaking \na more detailed assessment of the climate-related risks and opportunities, \nas well as their impact on our business, strategy and planning. \nWe have begun a property climate risk assessment of all our sites, starting in \nthe UK, and are developing a property climate change risk register. Our \nassessment applies the methodology introduced by the UK Green Building’s \nCouncil (UKGBC) in their ‘Framework for Measuring and Reporting of Climate-\nrelated Physical Risks to Built Assets’ (https://www.ukgbc.org/ukgbc-work/ \nmeasuring-and-reporting-framework/). It assesses site-level exposure against \nseveral risk categories: flooding, drought, air pollution, extreme weather, fire. \nAt present we are collating data via desk-based research and literature, in \nconjunction with input from property management teams, to begin mapping \nthe risk categories against likelihood (or probability per UKGBC terminology) \nand severity of impact. We have aligned classification to Bupa’s likelihood and \nseverity risk reporting classification so that we can use the risk register for \nTCFD and property risk reporting purposes. Once we have visibility of \nlikelihood and severity of risks per category on a site level across the UK \nportfolio we will be able to carry out an impact assessment. \nWe have also set up a Climate-related Guidance Working Group to address \nsome of the identified physical risks, more details on which can be seen in \nthe risk management section below. \nWe aim to improve our understanding of any material risk concentrations \nwithin our supply chain throughout 2023. What we do understand, however, \nis that approximately 98% of our company emissions are scope 3, and \nprocurement of goods and services is one of the top three contributing \ncategories to those scope 3 emissions. As such, we have worked to develop a \nprocurement sustainability programme and supplier engagement strategy that \nseeks to directly address emissions and reduce exposure to climate risk in our \nsupply chain, thereby contributing towards an economy-wide transition to net \nzero. The programme and strategy includes assessing supplier alignment to \nBupa’s targets and ambitions, and setting of targets to improve alignment \nrates. This supplier engagement will aid understanding of sector-specific \nchallenges and help us collaborate to work towards addressing them. In \naddition, complementary regulatory guidelines have led to increased focus \non business continuity (in event of a disaster) and even stressed exits \nfrom suppliers. \nBupa Annual Report 2022 103 \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n          \n            \n             \n    \n          \n         \n            \n            \n          \n            \n    \n             \n            \n      \n         \n        \n          \n      \n           \n           \n            \n          \n             \n          \n          \n              \n           \n       \n             \n            \n            \n       \n             \n  \n             \n            \n             \n          \n \n          \n          \n   \n   \n   \nStrategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements \nTask\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
