Market risk includes foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and price risk. \nThe financial risks are managed by the group, under policies approved by the board. The \nfinancial risk management is carried out by a centralised group treasury function. Group \ntreasuryâs role is to optimise the groupâs liquidity, mitigate financial risks and provide treasury \nservices to the groupâs operating businesses. The group uses derivative financial instruments, \nincluding forward currency contracts, interest rate swaps and currency swaps, to manage the \nfinancial risks associated with its underlying business activities and the financing of those \nactivities. Some derivative financial instruments used to manage financial risk are not \ndesignated as hedges and, therefore, are classified as at fair value through profit or loss. The \ngroup does not undertake any speculative trading activity in financial instruments. \nCredit risk \nWithin certain businesses, the group derives a significant proportion of its revenue from sales \nto major customers. Sales to individual customers are large if the value of precious metals is \nincluded in the price. The failure of any such company to honour its debts could materially \nimpact the groupâs results. The group derives significant benefit from trading with its \ncustomers and manages the risk at many levels. Each sector has a credit committee that \nregularly monitors its exposure. The Audit Committee receives a report every six months that \ndetails all significant credit limits, amounts due and overdue within the group, and the \nrelevant actions being taken. At 31st March 2023, trade receivables for the group amounted to \nÂ£1,304 million (2022: Â£1,393 million), excluding Â£14 million classified as held for sale, of \nwhich Â£1,077 million (2022: Â£1,167 million) are in Clean Air which mainly supplies car and \ntruck manufacturers and component suppliers in the automotive industry. Although Clean Air \nhas a wide range of customers, the concentrated nature of this industry means that amounts \nowed by individual customers can be large and, in the event that one of those customers \nexperiences financial difficulty, there could be a material adverse impact on the group. \nOther parts of the group tend to sell to a larger number of customers and amounts owed \ntend to be lower. At 31st March 2023, no single outstanding balance exceeded 2% (2022: 2%) \nof revenue.  \nThe credit profiles of the groupâs customers are obtained from credit rating agencies where \npossible and are closely monitored. The scope of these reviews includes amounts overdue and \ncredit limits. The groupâs exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual \ncharacteristics of each customer. However, risk associated with the industry and country in \nwhich customers operate may also influence the credit risk. The credit quality of customers is \nassessed against the appropriate credit ratings, financial strength, trading experience and \nmarket position to define credit limits. Controls and risk mitigants include daily monitoring of \nexposures, investing in counterparties with investment grade ratings, restricting the amount \nthat can be invested with one counterparty and credit-rating mitigation techniques. Generally, \npayments are made promptly in the automotive industry and in the other markets in which \nthe group operates. \nA provision matrix is used to calculate lifetime expected credit losses using historical loss rates \nbased on days past due and a broad range of forward-looking information, including country \nand market growth forecasts. This year, expected credit losses on unimpaired trade and \ncontract receivables remained at Â£16 million (2022: Â£16 million) despite the lower trade \nreceivables balance, reflecting a slightly heightened risk profile due to the volatile \nmacroeconomic environment. \nTrade receivables are specifically impaired when the amount is in dispute, customers are in \nfinancial difficulty or for other reasons which imply there is doubt over the recoverability of the \ndebt. They are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery, based on an \nestimate of the financial position of the counterparty. \n Movements in the allowance for credit losses on trade and contract receivables are as follows: \n \nGroup \n2023\nÂ£m \n2022 \nÂ£m \nAt beginning of year 37 30 \nCharge for year 5 18 \nUtilised (1) (1) \nReleased (11) (10) \nAt end of year 30 37 \nThe groupâs maximum exposure to default on trade and contract receivables is Â£1,429 million \n(2022: Â£1,575 million), of which Â£25 million is classified as held for sale. \nThe groupâs financial assets included in other receivables are all current and not impaired. \nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 2023 197\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION\nNotes on the Accounts continued for the year ended 31st March 2023 \n198 \n28 Financial risk management continued \nCredit risk continued \nThe credit risk on cash and deposits and derivative financial instruments is limited because the \ncounterparties with significant balances are banks with strong credit ratings.
