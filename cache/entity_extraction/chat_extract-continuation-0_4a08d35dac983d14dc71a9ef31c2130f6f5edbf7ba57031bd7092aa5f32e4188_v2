The key business drivers of the cash flow forecasts vary by CGU. \nFor aged care, key drivers are occupancy rates, fee rates, staff and agency costs and operating expenses. For \nprovision business, the cash flows are driven by number of customers, available clinician hours, fee rates and \noperating expenses. For insurance business, key drivers are assumed business volumes, future insurance premium \nrate rises, claims volatility and claims inflation. Cash ﬂow projections have been calculated from management \noperating proﬁt projections for a five-year period. These are based on the three-year plan which has been \napproved by the Board with further projections added for years four and five. Cash inflows or outflows relating \nto financing activities have been excluded from the estimated future cash flows. \nTaxation has been applied to the pre-taxation management operating proﬁts based on the statutory taxation rates \nin the country of operation. \nForecast future post-taxation cash ﬂows have been discounted at post-taxation discount rates. Discount rates have \nbeen derived using a Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) methodology, representing the minimum return \na business must earn on its asset base to satisfy providers of capital. Discount rates used for the value in use \ncalculations for each of the Group’s CGUs are based on considerations of the systemic risks associated with each \nCGU, as well as external factors such as inflation and local market leverage. These include the market assessment \nof the time value of money and the risks inherent in the relevant country where the cash ﬂows are generated. \nDuring 2022, global inflation has risen sharply, driven by the aftermath of the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. \nThis has resulted in increases to central bank interest rates, leading to increasing and more volatile bond yields. \nIn response to the macroeconomic conditions, the Group has reviewed the methodology for calculating WACC \nrates and moved from using a rolling average calculation for obtaining appropriate cost of debt and risk-free \nrate estimates, to using a spot rate approach as it is considered to be more appropriate in the current economic \nenvironment. The economic situation has driven increases in WACC rates for many of the CGUs as shown in the \ntable below. \nThe following table summarises the pre-taxation discount rates used for impairment testing for the main CGUs, \nwhich were determined through grossing up the post-tax discount rates by the applicable corporate taxation rates: \n2022 2021 \n% % \nBupa Australia Health Insurance 10.0 7.4 \nBupa Health Services Australia 13.1 9.3 \nBupa Villages and Aged Care Australia 10.3 9.8 \nHong Kong 11.4 10.0 \nBupa Chile 13.0 11.5 \nLUX MED 11.1 8.2 \nSanitas Seguros 10.6 8.6 \nSanitas Mayores 10.1 8.0 \nBupa Acıbadem Sigorta 27.7 17.7 \nCare Plus 15.8 13.1 \nBupa Care Services 8.5 7.0 \nBupa Dental Care UK 10.5 7.8 \nBupa\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BUPA<|><organization<|>Bupa is a global healthcare group providing health insurance, aged care, dental care, and other health services, with operations in multiple countries including Australia, UK, and Turkey)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUPA AUSTRALIA HEALTH INSURANCE<|><organization<|>A division of Bupa offering health insurance services in Australia)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUPA HEALTH SERVICES AUSTRALIA<|><organization<|>A division of Bupa providing healthcare services in Australia, including hospitals and clinics)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUPA VILLAGES AND AGED CARE AUSTRALIA<|><organization<|>A division of Bupa managing aged care facilities and retirement villages in Australia)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HONG KONG<|><geo<|>Hong Kong is a Special Administrative Region of China, where Bupa operates health insurance and healthcare services)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUPA CHILE<|><organization<|>A division of Bupa providing health insurance and healthcare services in Chile)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUX MED<|><organization<|>A healthcare provider and insurer based in Poland, part of Bupa's operations in Europe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SANITAS SEGUROS<|><organization<|>A health insurance company operating in Spain, part of Bupa's European health insurance services)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SANITAS MAYORES<|><organization<|>A division of Sanitas Seguros focusing on elderly care services in Spain)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUPA ACIBADEM SIGORTA<|><organization<|>A Turkish health insurance company, part of Bupa's operations in Turkey)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CARE PLUS<|><organization<|>A healthcare services provider, possibly in the UK or other markets, associated with Bupa)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUPA CARE SERVICES<|><organization<|>A division of Bupa managing aged care and healthcare services in various regions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUPA DENTAL CARE UK<|><organization<|>A division of Bupa providing dental care services in the United Kingdom)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>2022<|><event<|>The year during which the financial data and impairment testing are reported for Bupa)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>2021<|><event<|>The previous year referenced for comparative financial data in Bupa's report)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BUPA<|>BUPA AUSTRALIA HEALTH INSURANCE<|>Bupa operates multiple divisions including health insurance in Australia<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BUPA<|>BUPA HEALTH SERVICES AUSTRALIA<|>Bupa operates healthcare services including hospitals and clinics in Australia<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BUPA<|>BUPA VILLAGES AND AGED CARE AUSTRALIA<|>Bupa manages aged care facilities and retirement villages in Australia<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BUPA<|>HONG KONG<|>Bupa operates health insurance and healthcare services in Hong Kong<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BUPA<|>BUPA CHILE<|>Bupa provides health insurance and healthcare services in Chile<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BUPA<|>LUX MED<|>LUX MED is a healthcare provider and part of Bupa's European operations<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BUPA<|>SANITAS SEGUROS<|>Sanitas Seguros is a health insurance company in Spain, part of Bupa<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SANITAS SEGUROS<|>SANITAS MAYORES<|>Sanitas Mayores focuses on elderly care services in Spain, affiliated with Sanitas Seguros<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BUPA<|>BUPA ACIBADEM SIGORTA<|>Bupa operates in Turkey through Bupa Acıbadem Sigorta<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BUPA<|>CARE PLUS<|>Care Plus is a healthcare provider associated with Bupa<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BUPA<|>BUPA CARE SERVICES<|>Bupa manages aged care and healthcare services through Bupa Care Services<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BUPA<|>BUPA DENTAL CARE UK<|>Bupa provides dental care services in the UK<|>7)\n##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
