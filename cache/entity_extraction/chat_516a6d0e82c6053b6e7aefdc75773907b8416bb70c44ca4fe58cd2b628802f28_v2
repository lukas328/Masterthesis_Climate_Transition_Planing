and the ‘More \nExcellence Program’;\nAdvances made during \nthe year\nIn order to mitigate risks and reinforce our culture of pre-\nvention, we invest in a series of fronts. \nHighlights from 2022 included:\nWe continue moving forward with the actions forming \npart of our Maturity in Risk Management Plan, focus-\ning on improving the digitalization processes, and \nguaranteeing the ongoing updating of the Risks Map, \ntogether with our sustainability commitments and \nbusiness vision, whilst also reinforcing the connection \nof interdependence between the different factors to \nwhich we are exposed due to the nature of the busi-\nness, our global presence (subject to many different \nnorms and regulations), and the relationship between \nfinancial and non-financial aspects in the success of \nour strategy.\nOver recent years, we have been monitoring differ-\nent topics that are directly and indirectly linked to the \ncontinuity and longevity of the business, including \nsanitary and technical restrictions, possible epidemics, \ndata protection, tax, exchange and political-economic \nissues, and, in relation to EESG matters, climate as-\npects and regulatory

presenting this in relation to the \ncapitals accessed and transformed by the Company; their nature; and our \nmeasures concerning the response, mitigation and control as well as the \nassociated opportunities.\nSanitary and technical restrictions    \nSASB FB-MP-250a.4, GRI 3-3: Material Topic (Quality and safety of the \nproducts)\nAffected capitals:  \nSocial capital and Natural capital\nWhat is the risk?  \nOutbreaks, or the fear of outbreaks, of any diseases \namongst the animals can lead to the cancellation of \norders from our clients and lead to negative publicity that \ncould result in having an adverse material effect on the \nconsumer demand for our products. Furthermore, out-\nbreaks of animal diseases in Brazil can result in actions \ntaken by foreign governments to close export markets.\nHow do we manage this?  \nIn the global arena, the sanitary perspective also poses \nthe risk of embargoes. African swine fever in some coun-\ntries in the Americas brings with it the risk of closure of \nmarkets in case of an outbreak in Brazilian territories. Es-\npecially in the last few months of 2022 and the beginning \nof 2023, the region of the Americas saw an increase in the \ncases of bird flu in countries such as Canada, the United \nStates, Mexico, Argentina, Uruguay, Colombia, Chile, Vene-\nzuela and Peru. There is no certainty as to how the mar-\nkets will react to any possible positive cases confirmed in \nBrazil, but it is important to stress that the country does \nnot suffer from the disease.\nWhat opportunities exist?  \nThe quality and safety of the foods are non-negotiable \nassets that form an integral part of our strategy and man-\nagement system, and which run through our entire value \nchain. We believe that the main strategy for the preven-\ntion and control of sanitary issues lies in biosafety being \neffectively applied in all links of the chain. \nFood quality and safety  \nGRI 3-3: Material Topic (Quality and safety of the products)\nAffected capitals:  \nSocial capital and Natural capital \n \nWhat is the risk?  \nFood health and safety risks relating to our business and \nthe food industry as a whole can adversely affect our \nproduction and transportation processes, as well as our \nability to sell our products.\nHow do we manage this?  \nThe quality and safety of the \nfoods are non-negotiable \nassets that are part of our \nstrategy and management \nsystem, and which run through \nour entire value chain.\n2022 Integrated  \nReport\nOur way of  \ndoing business\nOur strategy\nCulture and \nEngagement\nValue Generation\nIndicators  \nand annex\n3\n4\n5\n6\n2\nPresentation1\n29\nBRF has established three commitments: Safety, Quality \nand Integrity. The Quality Policy establishes our commit-\nment to the quality and safety of our foods, the priority \ngiven to meeting all the legal requirements, and satis-\nfying the needs of our clients and consumers. We have \nCorporate Regulations that standardize all the processes \nrelating to quality at our production units. Furthermore, \nthrough our excellence programs such as ‘SEO’, ‘More \nExcellence’ and ‘Ideal Store’, we have strengthened ful-\nfillment of the standards defined in the company's dif-\nferent departments, advancing how non-compliance is \naddressed for the continued improvement of the BRF \nquality system. Indeed, this improvement is strengthened \nby means of internal and external audits, with the inter-\nnal ones evaluating the adherence of the internal proce-\ndures to legal requirements and client and certification \nstandards (undertaken annually by the Corporate Quality \nAssurance Department), whilst the external ones consider \nthe internationally\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
