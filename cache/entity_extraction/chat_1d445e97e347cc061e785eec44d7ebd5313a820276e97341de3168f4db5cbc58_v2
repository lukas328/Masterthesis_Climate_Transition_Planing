Our own operations seek net-zero by 2030; until then we will prioritize reducing our \nemissions and use removal-based offsetting only at the end of our net-zero journey. \nWe are committed to clear and transparent governance principles. This extends to our governance of \nsustainability matters as we work to embed and deliver sustainable objectives across global businesses \nunder our influence and within our organization. Ultimate responsibility for all matters relating to \nsustainability resides with the Board of Management of Allianz SE as the Group’s parent company, which \nincludes this Transition Plan.8  \nC Overview of Inaugural Net-Zero Transition Plan  \n \n \n \n  \n \n8 To support the Board of Management in its decision-making, Allianz SE established a dedicated Group Sustainability Board. It is \ncomposed of members of the Board of Management of Allianz SE and Group Center heads. \nFigure 2: Allianz Net-Zero Transition Plan at a glance \n \nTarget year 2030 is defined as using year-end 2029 values for proprietary investments, P&C, and own operations.  \nA) For own operations and for reporting purposes, we will be moving our year-end 2030 timeline one year forward to year-end 2029 to align \nwith reporting cut-off dates for proprietary investments and P&C insurance. The -70% target is based on end 2030. Year-end 2029 target \nis -65% vs. 2019. The strategy review for own operations is currently ongoing and will be updated in 2024. \nB) Investments in the context of this transition plan document refers always to proprietary investments, i.e., the investments of our insurance \nclients. Targets an absolute reduction for listed equity and corporate bonds, additionally -50% emission intensity for listed and non-listed \ninvestments into corporates. All continue to use base year 2019. \nC) Target covers P&C corporate portfolio with reported emissions managed by AGCS. Base year 2022. \nD) This inaugural target applies to the following markets: Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, UK. \nBase year 2022. \nE) 100% fossil-fuel-independent fleet – technical feasibility to be revisited annually. \nF) Climate Solutions are defined as economic activities contributing to climate change mitigation (including transition enabling) and \nadaptation, in alignment with existing climate-related sustainability taxonomies: EU taxonomy on sustainable finance climate category \nas well as SFDR Article 9 and beyond. \nG) Link: Allianz Energy Guidelines \nH) Transition solutions are defined as the technologies from Allianz’s Statement on Renewable/Low-Carbon Energy as well as carbon \ncapture and storage, battery storage and grid-stability-related investments, electric transportation: EV & battery manufacturing plants, \nelectric transportation: electric mass transit infrastructure construction (rail), certified green buildings, industry projects related to energy \ntransition (ammonia and bio-based fuels), waste to energy. PD = Property Damage, BI = Business Interruption \nI) Net-zero commitment and targets do not apply to assets managed on behalf of third parties \n\n \n \n \n 4/8 \n \n1. Proprietary Investments \n \nFor our proprietary investment portfolio, in 2019 we committed to reduce GHG emissions to net-zero by \n2050.  \n \nIn early 2021 we released our intermediary 2025 emission targets, which initially covered listed equities, \ncorporate bonds, and real estate. Our absolute emission reduction target of -25% by 2025 vs. 2019 for listed \nequity and corporate bonds had already been overachieved by the end of last year with a -35% reduction. \nThis can be attributed to -26%p due to portfolio re-allocations, overarchingly driven by intra-sector shifts to \nlower-emitting companies. A further -3%p came from a change in the denominator9 of the carbon \nfootprinting method, aligning with emerging regulatory standards. Real-world emission reductions by \ninvestee companies contributed -6%p, which shows that stronger short-term actions by investee companies \non emission reductions are necessary.  \n \nHerewith, we are presenting our 2030 targets, in line with our promise to continuously expand the scope of \ntargets. They have been developed with learnings from the Target Setting Protocol of the Net-Zero Asset \nOwner Alliance (NZAOA), of which Allianz was one of the founding organizations and holds the Chair \nposition. The targets expand across four different target dimensions, sub-portfolios, sectors, engagement \nand climate solution investments. \n \nFor our corporate portfolio, we now aim to reduce -50% by 2030 compared with our base year 2019. For \ntraded equity and corporate bonds, this is an absolute target. For all corporate, including infrastructure, \nprivate equity and debt, and similar, it is an additional intensity target. It expands to almost half of our \ntotal proprietary investment portfolio of 701 bn EUR as of 31.12.2022. For those real estate portfolios \nwhere data is available, we target a 1.5°C alignment as per Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor (CRREM) \nmethodology. \n \nUnderlying \nClass \n% of total \n707 bn EUR10  Actual 2022        2030       \n       Target 2019 2030 \nCor\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
