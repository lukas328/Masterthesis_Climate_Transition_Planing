We aim to offer a diverse and balanced portfolio, \nto meet the different nutritional needs of the consumers \nand demands of the market.\nIn 2022, we launched around 70 new products, such as, \nfor example, the vegetables forming the Veg & Tal Sadia, \nline, chicken joints as part of Assa Fácil in the Sadia Bio \nline, and Ready Meals with rice, chicken and creamed \ncorn.\nWe operate in categories that provide opportunities for \nimprovements in production, monitoring the trends in \ncurrent legislation, such as RDC n° 429, dated 2020, and \nIN n° 75, also dated 2020, which address the new nutri-\ntional labeling of foods in Brazil,\nWe contribute with access to high-protein food sources \nthrough a solid distribution network, supplying products \nthroughout the country.

The initiatives include \nissues such as animal welfare, control over the origins \nof the grains and quality of the foods, as well as devel-\nopment of new lines of products and businesses - from \nthe perspective of the growth plans set out in our future \nvision.\nAt the Innovation Center , we are constantly performing \nstudies to improve our products. The BRF Hub, mean-\nwhile, acts as BRF’s connection channel with the open \ninnovation ecosystem in Brazil and overseas, developing \ninitiatives such as the Challenges Program, which once \na year brings together innovative solutions developed \nby startups and academic researchers to help resolve \nthe company's strategic challenges. After only being in \nexistence for three years, the BRF Hub has already es-\ntablished 570 connections with startups. One of these \nconnections is with the Israeli startup Aleph Farms, with \nwhich BRF has established a partnership and become the \nfirst Brazilian company to enter the cultured meats mar-\nket, a strategic field for the future.\nKnowledge creation\nWhenever BRF brings technology and knowledge \ninto its activities, the benefits are evident not only \nto the Company but also to society as a whole. In \nparticular , the cooperation and synergy between \nBRF and the academic world have been extreme-\nly fruitful. These projects have taken the form of \nMasters and Doctorate research work to create \nand test new technologies.   \nSo far , BRF has made more than 20 presentations \nat congresses and established cooperations with \nBrazilian universities in states such as Santa Cata-\nrina, Rio Grande do Sul, Paraná and São Paulo, as \nwell as a number of foreign institutions.
