This metric assumes that the marginal impact of a pound lent or invested for that \nsector does not depend on existing financing in the sector. In other words, each additional or marginal pound of \nlending or investment to a customer in that sector, results in the same additional or marginal increase in activity \nand thus emissions in the real economy.\nEstimated convergence points: To estimate emissions intensity reduction required by 2030 (convergence year), \nwe have used externally published independent scenarios to estimate convergence points for 2020, 2021, 2030 \nand 2050 by sector based on a 2019 baseline. The convergence points are determined based on the rate of \nchange required by the external scenario each year between 2019 and 2030. The graphs included in sector \npages in this section include convergence points for 2020, 2021, 2030 and 2050, being the expected trajectory \n(convergence pathway) for alignment with the 2015 Paris Agreement. In general, we have used the UK CCC’s \nBNZ scenario or the IEA’s B2DS scenario for various sectors aligned with the Sectoral Decarbonization Approach \n(SDA) approach prescribed by the SBTi guidance. Aligned with the SBTi guidance, we have used those scenarios \nwhich require greatest percentage reduction in intensity for each sector Refer to page 89 for scenarios used for \neach sector.\nEstimates of financed emissions5.5\n77NatWest Group plc | 2022 Climate-related Disclosures Report\nGovernance Strategy and Climate transition planRisk Management and Scenario Analysis Metrics and TargetsIntroduction\nLink to NatWest Group balance sheet\nThe table below shows the on-balance sheet gross lending and investment exposure, accounted at amortised cost and FVOCI to sectors for which absolute emissions and emissions intensity analysis is included in this section at \n31 December 2021 and 2019.\nAs at 31 December 2021 As at 31 December 2019\nSystem Sector\nOn balance \nsheet loans & \ninvestments \n(£bn)\nLoans & \ninvestments\n analysed(1)\n(£bn) % analysed\nOn balance  \nsheet loans & \ninvestments \n(£bn)\nLoans & \ninvestments\n analysed(1)\n(£bn) % analysed Comments\nProperty\nResidential mortgages 194.0 194.0(*) 100% 174.0 174.0 100%\nCommercial real estate 18.3 15.6(*) 85% 23.2 17.7 76%\nLending secured by collateral is included for estimation of financed emissions.
