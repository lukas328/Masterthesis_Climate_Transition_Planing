AM-One also served as a member of the Advisory Group during its first year. \n \nIn September 2021, AM-One set its 2030 interim target as committing ¥30 trillion (USD 273 billion) worth of investment \nassets out of total AUM (¥57 trillion as of the end of March 2021) to align with the net zero scenario. This target is in line \nwith the NZAM’s commitments. \n \nAM-One will especially focus on the following three actions to move closer to achieving its targets. \nEstablish products \nthat promote net \nzero \nAM-One will establish active funds for investing in companies that maximize corporate value \nthrough initiatives dealing with important ESG challenges, like climate change, that threaten \nthe viability of our society. AM-One will also establish particular passive funds for conducting \nnet zero-focused client engagement. These funds will allow AM-One to make progress \ntowards achieving net-zero GHG emissions for AUM, and increase support from clients. \nFurther enhance \nclient engagement \nFollow on from stewardship activity efforts to date by further strengthening client engagement \nto enable the implementation of business model changes. These changes should contribute to \nthe decarbonization of investee companies. \nStrengthen \ncoordination with \ngovernment and \nrelated institutions \nAM-One will promote the shift to net zero across the entire investment chain by strengthening \ncoordination with the TCFD Consortium (of which it is a member), as well as government and \nrelated institutions that are involved with review meetings of the Ministry of Economy, Trade \nand Industry and the Ministry of the Environment. \n \nIn line with AM-One’s corporate message of “Creating a sustainable future through the power of investment ”, AM-One is \naiming to contribute to the future as an asset management company through continued collaborations with clients, investee \ncompanies, government and related institutions, and global asset managers. \n(See AM-One’s website for details about company initiatives: http://www.am-one.co.jp/english/information/sustainability/) \n  \nTCFD Report 2022  -29- \n \n3. Recognizing the opportunities created for the Mizuho group by climate change \nClimate change is one of the most important global issues that our stakeholders should be addressing. Mizuho’ s clients are also \nexpected to formulate and implement climate change countermeasures and strategies for transitioning to a low-carbon society. \n \nMuch remains unestablished regarding the technology and business models needed to support our clients ’ transition strategies \nand make decarbonization a reality. Technological innovation and a large amount of investment are needed for clients to implement \nconcrete action plans. \n \nAt Mizuho, we see client investment in technological and business model development aimed at decarbonization as an opportunity. \nUsing client engagement as a starting point, we are proactively supporting our clients’ transitions to a low-carbon society and their \nclimate change countermeasures. \n \nFigure 5: Reference – Investment amount estimates for becoming carbon neutral \nExpected investment amount in Japan through 2050 (Projected by Mizuho) \n \nExpected investment amount through 2030 (Projected by the Japanese government) \n \n \nExpected investment amount\nInvestment outlays in \nJapan through 2050 Approx. ¥470 trillion1\nRenewables\nCapital outlay for \nintroduction\n1: Required global investment set out in the IEA World\nEnergy Outlook 2021 (NZE scenario) report of \nUSD 4 trillion/year x Japan’s 3.2% share of global \nemissions = ¥16.3 trillion/year.
