In the first six \nmonths 18,739 recognitions were provided through the portal\n• We refreshed our annual JM Awards, a global competition to allow individuals and teams to \nbe recognised, to be aligned to our new play to win behaviours. Over 190 nominations were \nreceived, showcasing many fantastic achievements of our employees globally.\nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 2023 35\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTSOTHER INFORMATION\nSustainability continued\nAt the core of work to promote DI&B is the work of our Employee Resource Groups (ERGs). \nAs well as giving our people spaces to connect and share experiences, they directly feed into \nour culture development activities. We now have nine ERGs, following the launch of our \nHispanic/Latinx Organisation for Leadership and Advancement (HOLA). Throughout the year, \nthey organised webinars on topics such as LGBT+ paths to parenting, menopause and \nneurodiversity. Pride in JM and the Black Employee Network continued to lead our reverse \nmentoring efforts this year. These pairings give our leaders the chance to be mentored \nby junior colleagues on their lived experiences in the company.\nDisability inclusion\nOur work on advancing disability inclusion is informed by the DiversAbility ERG. With Liam \njoining as CEO, we updated and re-signed our commitment to the Valuable 500. We also \njoined the Business Disability Forum, a leading business membership organisation in disability \ninclusion. Our first site accessibility audit was completed, and actions taken to improve the \naccessibility for employees and visitors at our headquarters, and largest manufacturing site, \nin Royston, UK. An accessibility audit has since been completed at Clitheroe, UK, and plans \nare being developed to roll out the audits across our other sites.\nOur new DI&B policy commits us to:\n• Giving full and fair consideration to applications for employment by disabled persons, \nhaving regard to particular aptitude and abilities\n• Continuing the employment of and arranging appropriate training for employees who have \nbecome disabled during employment\n• Training, career development and promotion of disabled persons.\nPromoting ethnic diversity\nWe have three ERGs that are helping us to advance ethnic minority groups in different \ngeographies: Asian Network, Black Employee Network (BEN), Hispanic / Latinx Organisation \nfor Leadership and Advancement (HOLA).\nTo support the development of our Black, Asian and ethnic minority employees, we continued \nto participate in the Black British Business Awards talent acceleration programme in the UK.\nIn the US, we ran another cycle of the management accelerator programme with McKinsey \n& Company – this time with participants on all three, Black, Hispanic / Latinx, and Asian \nprogrammes.\nThe additional focus for next year is on upskilling hiring managers to ensure a fully inclusive \nhiring process.\nIn 2022, we partnered with the Association for Black Engineers and the Royal Academy \nof Engineering on its annual Graduate Engineering Engagement Programme, which aims to \nimprove the transition of engineering graduates from diverse backgrounds into engineering \nemployment. Members of our team supported the mentoring programme, skills and \ncompetency workshops, and networking sessions, reaching over 200 diverse candidates. \nWe also partnered with the Royal Society of Chemistry for its Broadening Horizons in the \nChemical Sciences programme, a new three-year pilot to support chemistry students and \ngraduates from Black and minority ethnic backgrounds to pursue careers in chemistry. \nIn September 2022, we joined nine other partners in hosting a taster event to showcase the breadth \nof careers in the chemical sciences and are now working on visits to our sites across the UK. \nPeople: Promoting a safe, diverse and equitable society continued\n1.

It is essential that our trans colleagues can be themselves at work and that we \nsupport them, their manager and HR colleagues.\nAdvancing diversity, inclusion and belonging\nInnovation requires diversity of thought, background and representation as well as a culture \nof inclusion and belonging.
