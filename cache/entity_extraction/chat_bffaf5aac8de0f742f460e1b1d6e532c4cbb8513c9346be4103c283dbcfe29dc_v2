These issues have \nalso been monitored through People updates to the \nBoard from the Chief Sustainability and People Officer. \nThe cost of living has increased disproportionately \naround the world in recent months, creating a cost \nof living crisis for many people, including within our \nworkforce. The Board has endorsed local responses \nsuitable to the situation in each of our markets. Actions \ntaken included bringing forward pay increases by \nseveral months and providing one-off payments to \nhelp ease the cost of living. \nSustainability \nIn 2021, we identified sustainability as a core pillar \nof our 3x6 strategy and set our ambition to become a \nnet zero business by 2040 as we want Bupa to have a \npositive impact on the world. Since then, we have been \ndeveloping a detailed sustainability strategy to set out \nhow we aim to achieve the ‘making a better world’ part \nof our purpose. On the recommendation of the Board \nSustainability Committee, the Board approved our \nsustainability strategy in early 2022. The sustainability \nstrategy focuses on the intersection of human and \nplanetary health as this is the area where we believe \nthat Bupa, as a healthcare organisation, can have the \ngreatest impact. The Board believes that the strategy \nsets out ambitious objectives which will create \nmeasurable business value and brand differentiation, \nwhile also safeguarding Bupa’s long-term viability. \nBupa Annual Report 2022 53 \n       \n        \n         \n           \n        \n       \n           \n        \n        \n       \n       \n        \n          \n   \n          \n           \n       \n     \n  \n         \n        \n         \n        \n        \n  \n        \n         \n         \n            \n        \n        \n          \n        \n           \n    \n \n         \n       \n       \n           \n          \n          \n       \n         \n          \n           \n       \n         \n         \n          \n          \n         \n        \n \n    \n        \n         \n            \n           \n       \n       \n         \n     \n       \n    \n       \n        \n      \n       \n        \n       \n  \n     \n      \n         \n        \n            \n         \n        \n         \n         \n         \n   \n      \n          \n           \n          \n           \n       \n        \n         \n          \n     \n          \n         \n       \n        \n          \n        \n          \n         \n          \n       \n       \n      \n          \n \n   \nStrategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements \nLeadership continued \nIn July 2022, the Board reviewed management’s \nplans to implement the sustainability strategy and \nthe initial priorities. This included driving actions to \nmeet Bupa’s target to reduce its global Scope 1 and 2 \ngreenhouse gas emissions footprint by 40% from our \n2019 baseline. The Board also considered progress \non external assurance over the Group’s Scope 1, 2 and \nlimited Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions data for \n2021, and it approved a report containing these \ndisclosures on the recommendation of the Audit \nCommittee in December 2022. A new Sustainability \nEnterprise Risk Policy was also approved by the \nBoard in late 2022 on the recommendation of the \nBoard Sustainability Committee. \nMore details of the sustainability strategy can be found in \nthe Sustainability and ESG section on page 22, the Board \nSustainability Committee’s report on page 79 and the \nSection 172 statement on page 36. \nChilean Isapre business \nOne of Bupa’s businesses in Chile, Isapre Cruz Blanca, \nhas been negatively impacted by judicial and regulatory \naction. There has been a shift in recent years which \nhas severely limited the Isapre industry's ability to \nproperly price to cover risk, medical inflation, and \nmedical coverage. \nThe most recent development was the decision of \nthe Chilean Supreme Court described on page 11. \nThe potential future impact on Bupa’s balance sheet \nof this decision could be material. The Board has been \nwatching events in Chile closely and considering our \nfuture strategy for the Isapre business, and continues \nto monitor the long-term viability of our Isapre business. \nMore detail regarding the financial implications is set \nout in the Financial Review on page 9 and the Audit \nCommittee report on page 67. \nOther activities \nOther activities of the Board during the year include \nconsidering and approving the first iteration of Group-\nwide Recovery and Resolution Plans for submission \nto the PRA. These are plans that the PRA requires \ninsurance groups to put in place at both an insurance \nentity level and at holding company level to set out \npotential actions the Company and/or the regulator \ncould take to maintain or recover the Group’s solvency \nin an extreme stress scenario or, if necessary, the steps \nthat could be taken to wind down the Group in an \norderly fashion. The Risk Committee considered the \ndraft plans in detail ahead of recommending them to \nthe Board. These plans will continue to be developed \nbased on feedback from the PRA and changes to the \nbusiness over time and are there to ensure that our \ncustomers are protected as much as possible in the \nevent that the Group faced an extreme stress scenario. \nOur people \nCulture and our people \nThe Board is responsible for ensuring that our culture \nis aligned with Bupa’s purpose, values and strategy at \nall levels of the organisation. In order to do our best for \nour customers, we need to take care of our people, and \nthis will lead to strong and sustainable performance \nto enable us to deliver our purpose. \nThe Board monitors culture in a number of ways, \nincluding direct workforce engagement (described \nfurther below) and regular people-related items on \nits agenda including: \n▪ Measuring our people’s engagement level and how \nthey embody Bupa’s values through our People Pulse\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
