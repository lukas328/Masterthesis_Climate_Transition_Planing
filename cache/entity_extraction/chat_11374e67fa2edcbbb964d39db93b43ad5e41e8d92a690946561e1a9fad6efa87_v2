As part of this work, we chair \nthe Investment Association’s SDR Implementation Forum and have \nrepresentation on the joint industry association responsible for developing \nthe consumer facing disclosures required under SDR. \nIn addition, we are actively involved in regional industry body committees \nand working groups considering sustainability regulation, both current \nand prospective, ensuring we contribute to the sustainability regulatory \nlandscape. Overall, our advocacy and engagements with respect to \nregulation seek to support the development of a regulatory landscape that \nprovides comparability and better sustainable outcomes for our investors.\nActive ownership\n33\nSustainability and Stewardship Report\nActive ownership is a core component of Ninety One’s investment \nprocesses. We regard exercising ownership rights, including engagement \nand proxy voting, as a means to enhance the value of our clients’ assets \nand deliver on their expectations. Our Stewardship policy and proxy \nvoting guidelines  explain our voting and engagement approach.\nOur engagement approach \nEngagement is our preferred means to address issues that can affect the \nvalue of investments. We define engagements as communications with a clear \npurpose that seek an identified outcome. To identify a need for engagement, \nwe assess the materiality of the issue, the potential impact of engagement, and \nits ability to exert influence. We have three engagement categories: \n ɽ Strategic: A critical opportunity to create or preserve value where we \nbelieve we can have influence. These engagements are company-wide \nand often longer-term.\n ɽ General: An engagement to ascertain whether a company has \nidentified relevant issues and that these are being managed \nappropriately.\n ɽ Advocacy: A firmwide engagement, usually involving collaboration and \ntargeting thematic cross-cutting issues. \nEngagement escalation\nEngagement is a means of establishing long-term relationships with \ncompany management and engaging where we believe there is the \npotential to unlock value, whether through avoiding risk or maximising \nopportunities. We seek to identify areas of focus and encourage \nimprovements that we believe will be value additive through a theory of \nchange. Often, we will engage with companies in areas they are already \ndoing well, e.g., culture or carbon avoided, and where we may push for \nfurther improvements or additional disclosure.\nWe believe that divestment due to an engagement failing to make progress \nshould be a last resort. Engagement can be a long-term process, and a \ncompany’s willingness to engage and the progress made should be taken \ninto consideration, alongside regional and cultural factors. Typically, before \ndivesting we would seek to escalate an engagement. This may involve \ncollaborating with other shareholders and stakeholders (such as non-\ngovernmental organisations, banks and regulators) or external initiatives, \nvoting at shareholder meetings and proposing our own resolutions. \n34\nSustainability and Stewardship Report\nForming a governance group\nDuring the last year, Ninety One set up an in-house governance group, \nwith members from across our regional Investment teams, and our \nSustainability and Operations teams. The group is a forum to leverage \nexpertise from across the business, share best practice, and ensure \nconsistency in implementing our ownership responsibilities. It fulfils several \nfunctions of relevance to our engagements:\n ɽ Assess Ninety One’s stewardship policies and where necessary \nwork to improve existing policies or develop additional guidance.\n ɽ Stay abreast of governance-related developments such as updated \nstewardship codes and new regulation, and determine how this can \nbe implemented effectively.\n ɽ Advise on engagement strategy or potentially contentious \nproxy votes.\n ɽ Discuss notable case studies to identify learnings or how to \nreplicate successes.\nOutcomes from the governance group meetings are reported to, and \ninform the work of, the Sustainability Committee, as relevant.\nWe may also make public statements in the press, although we \nwould not do so until direct engagement with the board and \nmanagement team had failed. If the lack of progress on critical \nissues continues, disposal of an investment may be necessary. \nPlease see the case studies on page 43 for an example of \nengagement escalation.\n35\nSustainability and Stewardship Report\nOverview11\nEngagement by topic \nClimate change, 26%\nRemuneration, 10%\nOther, 9%\nCultural work practices, 8%\nBoard effectiveness, 8%\nReporting and disclosure, 8%\nCapital management, 6%\nCorporate strategy, 5%\nBoard diversity, 4%\nDiversity and inclusion, 4%\nPollution and waste, 3%\nBiodiversity, 3%\nWater, 3%\nStakeholder rights, 2%\nHealth and safety, 2%\nEngagement by region\nAmericas, 33%\nAfrica, 20%\nAsia-Pacific, 19%\nUK, 14%\nEurope ex-UK, 13%\nMiddle East, 1%\nStrategic engagement by outcome\nOngoing, 95%\nClosed - Goal achieved, 3%\nClosed - Goal partially achieved, 2%\n351\ngeneral\nengagements \n99\nstrategic\nengagements  \nof which \nwere climate-related \nengagements \nwith top emitters\n70\n38\nadvocacy \nengagements12 \n(covering \n319 companies)\n11.
