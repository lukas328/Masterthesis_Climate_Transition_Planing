\nappropriate. The amount of collateral received or posted is shown in the table above. \nFor the financial assets and liabilities subject to enforceable master netting arrangements or similar arrangements \nabove, each agreement between the Group and the counterparty allows for net settlement of the relevant financial \nassets and liabilities where both elect to settle on a net basis. In the absence of such an election, financial assets \nand liabilities will be settled on a gross basis; however, each party to the master netting agreement or similar \nagreement will have the option to settle all such amounts on a net basis in the event of default of the other party. \n26.4 Liquidity risk \nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not have available funds to meet its liabilities when they fall due. \nThe Group’s main source of short-term funding is via a £900m revolving credit facility which had an initial maturity \nof December 2026 with two, one-year extension options. The first extension option has been exercised leaving the \ncurrent maturity as December 2027 with a further one-year extension. The facility was drawn down by £70m as at \n31 December 2022. \nThe Group monitors funding risk as well as compliance with existing financial covenants within the banking \narrangements. There were no concerns regarding bank covenant coverage in 2022 and that position is not \nexpected to change in the foreseeable future. \nThe Group holds a strong liquidity position and adheres to strict liquidity management policies as set by the Board \nRisk Committee as well as adhering to liquidity parameters for the Group’s regulated entities. Regular stress testing \nis conducted to assess liquidity risk. \nThe contractual maturities of undiscounted financial liabilities and the expected maturities of insurance liabilities \nincluding estimated interest payments of the Group are as follows: \nOther \nProvisions liabilities \nOther arising arising \ninterest- from from Trade and \nSubordinated bearing Lease insurance insurance other Derivative \nliabilities liabilities liabilities contracts business payables¹ liabilities Total \n£m £m £m £m £m £m £m £m \nAs at 31 December 2022 \n2023 (297) (83) (177) (3,646) (221) (2,162) (73) (6,659) \n2024 (35) (308) (153) (63) – (21) (15) (595) \n2025 (34) (5) (131) – – (34) – (204) \n2026 (434) (5) (113) – – (1) – (553) \n2027 (14) (303) (104) – – – (49) (470) \n2028-2032 (73) – (332) – – – – (405) \nAfter 2032 (386) – (219) – – – – (605) \nTotal (1,273) (704) (1,229) (3,709) (221) (2,218) (137) (9,491) \nCarrying value in the \nConsolidated Statement of \nFinancial Position (998) (648) (932) (3,709) (221) (2,218) (137) (8,863) \nBupa Annual Report 2022 193 \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n    \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                 \n                \n    \n   \n                 \n \n                \n  \n               \n \n    \n                   \n                  \n             \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n    \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n             \n            \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n    \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n             \n            \n \n       �\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
