We are fully committed to the \nprotection of the environment, the management of water \nand the fight against climate change.\nOur activities in this area are guided by our Sustainability \nPolicy and our Policy for Health, Safety and Environment \n(HSE), as well as regulations such as the ISO 14001, \nprograms such as the âMais ExcelÃªnciaâ (+Excellence) and \nâOperational Excellence Systemâ (OES) programs, and by \nlaws and regulations to ensure that we are constantly \nstriving for efficiency in our activities. \nTo ensure execution of the environmental management \nsystem, our governance in relation to this topic involves \nlocal HSE teams at all the units and operations, and \ntactical committees involving managers and leaders \nwith responsibilities being clearly assigned in relation \nto environmental controls. One example of this is \nthe Water Steering Committee, which is focused on \nencouraging actions of water resource management \nin the operation (read more on the following pages). The \nAnimal Welfare Committee is another instrument of \ngovernance concerning animal welfare that covers a \nnumber of different environmental issues connected to \nthe management, farming and slaughter of animals (read \nmore on page 94).\nWe have an Environmental Sustainability Index (ESI) that \nis used as an indicator for monitoring the protection \nof the environment and our performance in relation to \neffluents, waste, emissions, noise, smell and compliance \nwith environmental authorizations and licensing. The ESI \nenvironmental indicators, as well as gauging the industrial \nand farming units in Brazil, Abu Dhabi and Turkey, also \napply as a pilot project to our grain units. \nIn 2022, compliance with the ESI reached 93.6%, with the \nforecast target having been 93%. This indicator varies in \naccordance with any updating that is made to the legal \nrequirements and renewals of the environmental licenses. \nBetween 2014 and 2022 we invested a total of â¬ 427 \nmillion in projects that benefit the environment and \nadhere to one or more of the eligibility criteria estab-\nlished by the green bonds issued by BRF. In 2021 and \n2022 alone, these investments (which were made in the \nareas of energy efficiency, renewable energy sources \nand reduction of greenhouse gas emissions) totaled \nR$ 369.11 million (or â¬ 105.64 million, considering the \nWe have an Environmental Sustainability \nIndex (ESI) that is used as an indicator \nfor monitoring the protection of the \nenvironment and our performance in relation \nto effluents, waste, emissions, noise, \nsmell and compliance with environmental \nauthorizations and licensing\nexchange rate at the time of the launch of the green \nbonds in 2015.\nThe HSE issues are considered in relationship to all the \nparties interested in our operations, including in the \nprocesses that involve the transportation of people and \ncargo, and which form a part of the HSE Management \nSystem for Transport and Distribution.
