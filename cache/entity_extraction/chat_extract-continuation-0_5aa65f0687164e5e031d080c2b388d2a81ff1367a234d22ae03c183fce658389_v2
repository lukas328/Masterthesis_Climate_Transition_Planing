For the purposes of assessing going \nconcern, we have revisited our financial projections using the latest forecasts for our base case \nscenario. The base case scenario was stress tested to a severe-but-plausible downside case \nwhich reflects severe recession scenarios. \nThe severe-but-plausible case for Clean Air modelled scenarios assuming a smaller light duty \nvehicle market from reduced vehicle production and/or market consumer demand disruption \nor greater share of zero emission vehicles in market, assumed to result in a 10% drop in sales. \nFor PGMS and Catalyst Technologies, it also assumed a reduction in sales and associated \noperating profit based on adverse scenarios using external and internal market insights. \nAdditionally, as part of viability testing, the group considered scenarios including the impact \nfrom metal price volatility, higher inflation, delays in capital projects and delivery of cost \ntransformation savings, and slow down of operations in China. Whilst the combined impact \nwould reduce profitability and EBITDA against our latest forecast, our balance sheet remains \nstrong with ample working capital and Net Debt/EBITDA ratios. \nThe group has a robust funding position comprising a range of long-term debt and a £1 billion \nfive year committed revolving credit facility maturing in March 2027 which was entirely \nundrawn at 31st March 2023. There was £521 million of cash held in money market funds \nand £129 million of other cash and bank deposits. Of the existing loans, £151 million of term \ndebt and £4 million of other bank loans mature in the period to June 2024. We assume no \nrefinancing of this debt in our going concern modelling. As a long time, highly rated issuer in \nthe US private placement market and having recently extended its UK Export Financing \nfacility, the group expects to be able to access additional funding in its existing markets if \nrequired but the going concern conclusion is not dependant on such access as the company \nhas sufficient financing and liquidity to fund its obligations in the base and severe-but-\nplausible scenarios. The group also has a number of additional sources of funding available \nincluding uncommitted metal lease facilities that support precious metal funding. Whilst we \nwould fully expect to be able to utilise the metal lease facilities, they are excluded from our \ngoing concern modelling. \nConclusion \nUnder all scenarios above, the group has sufficient headroom against committed facilities and \nkey financial covenants are not in breach during the going concern period. To give further \nassurance on liquidity, we have also undertaken a reverse stress test to identify what \nadditional or alternative scenarios and circumstances would threaten our current financing \narrangements. This shows that we have headroom against a further decline in profitability \nbeyond the severe-but-plausible scenario or a significant increase in borrowings. Furthermore, \nthe group has a range of levers which it could utilise to protect headroom including reducing \ncapital expenditure, renegotiating payment terms and reducing future dividend distributions. \nThe directors are therefore of the opinion that the group has adequate resources to fund its \noperations for the period of at least twelve months following the date of this announcement \nthese financial statements and there are no material uncertainties relating to going concern so \ndetermine that it is appropriate to prepare the accounts on a going concern basis. \nNotes on the Accounts continued for the year ended 31st March 2023 \n151 \n1 Accounting policies continued \nSignificant accounting policies \nThe group’s and parent company’s accounting policies have been applied consistently during \nthe current and prior year, other than where new policies have been adopted (see below). The \ngroup’s and parent company’s significant accounting policies are as follows: \nForeign currencies \nForeign currency transactions are recorded in the functional currency of the relevant \nsubsidiary, joint venture, associate or branch at the exchange rate at the date of the \ntransaction. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are retranslated into the relevant \nfunctional currency at the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. \nIncome statements and cash flows of overseas subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates and \nbranches are translated into sterling at the average rates for the year. Balance sheets of \noverseas subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates and branches, including any fair value \nadjustments and related goodwill, are translated into sterling at the exchange rates at the \nbalance sheet date. \nExchange differences arising on the translation of the net investment in overseas subsidiaries, \njoint ventures, associates and branches, less exchange differences arising on related foreign \ncurrency financial instruments which hedge the group’s net investment in these operations, \nare taken to other comprehensive income. On disposal of the net investment, the cumulative \nexchange difference is reclassified from equity to operating profit.  \nOther exchange differences are recognised in operating profit. \nRevenue \nRevenue represents income derived from contracts for the provision of goods and services by \nthe parent company and its subsidiaries to customers in exchange for consideration in the \nordinary course of the group’s activities. \nPerformance obligations  \nUpon approval by the parties to a contract, the contract is assessed to identify each promise to \ntransfer either a distinct good or service or a series of distinct goods or services that are \nsubstantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer. Goods and \nservices are distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations in the contract if \nthe customer can benefit from them either on their own or together with other resources that \nare readily available to the customer and they are separately identifiable in the contract. \nThe group typically sells licences to its intellectual property together with other goods and \nservices and, since these licences are not generally distinct in the context of the contract, \nrevenue recognition is considered at the level of the performance obligation of\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>RUSSIA<|>GEO<|>Russia is a country involved in a war with Ukraine, impacting global economic outlooks and market stability)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UKRAINE<|>GEO<|>Ukraine is a country engaged in a conflict with Russia, affecting international relations and economic conditions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLEAN AIR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Clean Air is a company modeling scenarios related to vehicle markets, zero emission vehicles, and market disruptions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PGMS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>PGMS is an organization involved in manufacturing or technology, modeled in adverse market scenarios affecting sales and profits)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CATALYST TECHNOLOGIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Catalyst Technologies is a company impacted by external and internal market insights, with reduced sales and operating profit in adverse scenarios)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINA<|>GEO<|>China is a country where the group considers potential slowdowns in operations as part of viability testing)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The group is a corporate entity involved in manufacturing, financial management, and scenario planning, with a strong balance sheet and diverse funding sources)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FUNDING<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Funding refers to the financial resources and credit facilities available to the group, including long-term debt and revolving credit facilities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>METAL LEASE FACILITIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Metal lease facilities are financial arrangements supporting precious metal funding, excluded from going concern modeling)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARCH 2027<|>GEO<|>Maturity date for the group's five-year revolving credit facility)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>31st MARCH 2023<|>GEO<|>Date at which the group's cash holdings and financial assessments are based)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEBT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Refers to the group's term debt and bank loans maturing in June 2024, part of the group's financial obligations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>US PRIVATE PLACEMENT MARKET<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Market where the group is a highly rated issuer, providing access to additional funding if needed)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UK EXPORT FINANCING<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Financial facility recently extended by the group to support international trade financing)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOING CONCERN<|>EVENT<|>The assessment that the group has sufficient resources to continue operations for at least twelve months, with no material uncertainties)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REVERSE STRESS TEST<|>EVENT<|>A financial analysis performed to identify scenarios that could threaten the group's current financing arrangements)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAPITAL EXPENDITURE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Potential cost reduction lever for the group to protect financial headroom during adverse scenarios)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RENEGOTIATING PAYMENT TERMS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Strategy the group could use to maintain liquidity and headroom in financial covenants)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DISTRIBUTIONS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Future dividend distributions that could be reduced to preserve financial stability)\n##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
