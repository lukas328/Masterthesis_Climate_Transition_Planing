For \nexample, we recently were included in the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change’s and Transition \nPathway Initiative’s (TPI)1 financial sector pilot. The TPI is developing a framework to assess the financial \nsector’s preparedness for energy transition and, to that end, conducted a pilot analysis of 27 banks from \nacross the world, including Citi. The pilot indicators attempted to capture a comprehensive picture of \nCiti’s Net Zero Plan by looking at our (1) net zero commitments; (2) short- and medium-term targets; (3) \ndecarbonization strategies; (4) climate governance; (5) climate policy engagement; and (6) audit and \naccounts. The TPI pilot found that Citi was a leader among other pilot participants in climate governance \nand noted the granularity of our disclosures regarding our exposure to high-risk sectors. \nAs a global bank, we also engage with various local and national policymakers around the world on a range \nof topics including net-zero initiatives, modeling and disclosure. We are also a part of the Net Zero Banking \n1 The TPI Global Climate Transition Centre, launched by the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment (based at \nthe London School of Economics and Political Science) is an independent, authoritative source of research, designed to assess the world’s \nbiggest companies as they transition to a low-carbon economy, with particular focus on corporate climate governance and carbon emissions. \nFor more information, please see the TPI’s website.\n8 | TCFD REPORT 2022: CITI’S APPROACH TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND NET ZERO\nAlliance (NZBA), which is part of the broader Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ). This year’s \nReport also discusses the recommendations and voluntary guidance of GFANZ’s Financial Institutions Net-\nzero Transition Plans.\nIt is difficult to reflect on this past year without acknowledging the humanitarian crisis created by Russia’s \ninvasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and the resulting economic uncertainty in global energy security and \ncommodity prices. These events have highlighted the challenges inherent in the clean energy transition, \nas well as the importance of an orderly and equitable transition that minimizes global disruption while \nensuring access to energy. We are working with our clients to explore ways to align their individual \nemissions reduction strategies with the broader transition to a low-carbon economy. \nInformed by GFANZ Recommendations and Guidance\nCiti is a member of the GFANZ and NZBA steering groups that provide voluntary guidance on the \ndevelopment of net zero leadership initiatives and frameworks. \nIn June 2022, GFANZ released its recommendations and voluntary guidance for Financial \nInstitution Net-zero Transition Plans  which identifies four approaches to support real economy  \nGHG emissions reductions:\n1. Climate Solutions: financing or enabling entities and activities that develop and scale  \nclimate solutions; \n2. Aligned: financing or enabling entities that are already aligned to a 1.5°C pathway; \n3. Aligning: financing or enabling entities committed to 1.5°C-aligned pathways; and  \n4. Managed Phaseout: financing or enabling the accelerated managed phaseout of high-emitting \nphysical assets. \nTo that end, the guidance recommends that a net zero plan address ten core components grouped \ninto five themes: (1) Foundations; (2) Implementation Strategy; (3) Engagement Strategy; (4) Metrics \nand Targets; and (5) Governance. Our Net Zero Plan graphic on page 7 builds upon this guidance.\nIn addition to continued implementation of the TCFD recommendations, this report is also informed \nby the GFANZ guidance. We have drawn from GFANZ’s guidance in developing our approach, but note \nthat there may be some areas where we deviate if a particular recommendation does not make sense \nfor Citi given our businesses and unique geographic footprint.\nTCFD REPORT 2022: CITI’S APPROACH TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND NET ZERO | 9\nTimeline of Climate Action\n2015\nLaunched first Sustainable Progress Strategy \nand $100B Environmental Finance Goal\n2017\nAnnounced goal to source 100% renewable  \nelectricity for our facilities by 2020\n2019\nIssued inaugural €1B green bond\nFirst U.S. signatory of the Principles for  \nResponsible Banking\nCo-developed the Poseidon Principles\n2021\nAnnounced net zero emissions by 2050\nFounding member of  \nthe Net-Zero Banking Alliance \nJoined Breakthrough Energy Catalyst and RMI \nCenter for Climate Aligned Finance\n2023\nAdded Auto Manufacturing, Commercial Real \nEstate, Steel and Thermal Coal Mining loan \nportfolios to our Net Zero Plan\n2007\nIssued our first Climate Change  \nStatement, supporting a globally connected  \nmarket-based climate policy\nFirst U.S. bank to set a GHG reduction target\nLaunched 10-year $50B Climate Initiative\n2014\nCo-created The Green Bond Principles\n2018\nPublished first TCFD Report \nSigned “We Are Still In” Declaration \n in support of the Paris Agreement\n2020\nLaunched updated Sustainable Progress Strategy\nLaunched Citi Impact Fund\nIssued $1.5B green bond\nJoined Partnership for Carbon Accounting  \nFinancials (PCAF)\nPublished second TCFD Report\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CITI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Citi is a global bank actively engaged in climate and sustainability initiatives, including net zero commitments, climate governance, and policy engagement.
