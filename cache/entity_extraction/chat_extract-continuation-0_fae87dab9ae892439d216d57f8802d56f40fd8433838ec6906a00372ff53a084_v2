The IBRF is responsible \nfor managing the BRF Corporate Volunteer Program \nand for the entire BRF social intelligence area, defining \nthe strategies for social investment in the different \nregions, especially where there are productive units, and \nacting with the different business areas to find oppor-\ntunities for the promotion of a positive social impact in \nthe communities and society as a whole through two \nstrategic lines: “Food that Transforms” and “Education \nfor the Future”.\nThe BRF Institute is supported in its operations both by \nmeans of its own resources, provided by BRF, and by the \nguidance provided by the investment of tax-deducted \nfunds obtained through state laws.

To this enormous \nimpact can be added actions employed by the Company \ntogether with the communities neighboring its activities - \nthe objective of which is to promote local development.\nIn 2022, 27 of the Company's units developed programs \nfocused on the needs of the communities of which they \nform a part, identified by means of communities and \nprocesses of consultation together with the community. \nThese actions are led by the BRF Institute. All of the \nunits have socio-environmental impact evaluations, work \ncouncils, OHS commissions and formal processes for \nreceiving complaints from the local communities.\nIn the area of Corporate Affairs, we perform engagement \nactions that involve meetings in which the BRF senior \nmanagement takes part, dialogs with authorities and \nrepresentatives of the local government and business \ncommunity, as well as meetings with the operational \nteams of private institutions and companies. The \nactions involve three pillars: constructing long-term \nrelationships; working on the proposing and discussion \nof public policies; or acting in reaction to emergency \nand/or critical situations, such as crises of image or \nreputation, or emerging agendas. In these cases, we \ncan work directly or through sector entities, depending \nupon the issues in question.\nHighlighted by our stakeholders during the process \nthat resulted in BRF’s current materiality (read more \non page 4), the issue of food safety is addressed in \nthe commitments made in the BRF Sustainability Plan \nand is amongst the priorities of the Company's social \nimpact programs.
