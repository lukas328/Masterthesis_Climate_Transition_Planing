OTHER INFORMATION\nOther disclosures\nDirectors’ reappointment Johnson Matthey Plc’s Articles of Association (the Articles) provide the rules on director appointments and are consistent with the recommendation contained within the Code. \nAll directors retire and are eligible for re-election at each AGM (except any director appointed after the notice of an AGM meeting is published and before that AGM is held).\nDirectors’ powers The powers of the directors are determined by the Articles, UK legislation including the 2006 Act, and any directions given by the Company in general meetings. The directors are \nauthorised by the Company’s Articles to issue and allot ordinary shares and to make market purchases of its own shares. These powers are referred to shareholders for renewal at each \nAGM. Further information is set out below under ‘Authority to purchase own shares’.\nConstitution\nArticles of Association The Articles may only be amended by a special resolution at a general meeting of the Company. The Articles were adopted on 17th July 2019 and are available on our  \nwebsite: matthey.com/corporate-governance.\nBranches The Company and its subsidiaries have established branches in several different countries in which they operate.\nChange of control As at 31st March 2023 and as at the date of approval of this Annual Report, there were no significant agreements, to which the company or any subsidiary was or is a party to, that take \neffect, alter or terminate on a change of control of the Company, whether following a takeover bid or otherwise.\nHowever, the Company and its subsidiaries were, as at 31st March 2023, and as at the date of approval of this report, party to a number of commercial agreements. These may allow \ncounterparties to alter or terminate the commercial agreements on a change of control of JM following a takeover bid. These are not deemed significant in terms of their potential \neffect on the group.\nThe group also has a number of loan notes and borrowing facilities that may require prepayment of principal and payment of accrued interest and breakage costs if there is a change \nof control of JM. The group has entered into a series of financial instruments to hedge its currency, interest rate and metal price exposures, which provide for termination or alteration \nif a change of control at JM materially weakens the creditworthiness of the group.\nThe executive directors’ service contracts each contain a provision to the effect that, if the contract is terminated by the Company within one year after a change of control of the \nCompany, JM will pay an amount equivalent to one year’s gross base salary and other contractual benefits, less the period of any notice given by the Company, to the director as \nliquidated damages.\nThe rules of the Company’s employee share schemes set out the consequences of a change of control of the Company on participants’ rights under the schemes. Generally, the rights \nwill vest and become exercisable on a change of control, subject to the satisfaction of relevant performance conditions. As at 31st March 2023, and as at the date of approval of this \nAnnual Report, there were no other agreements between the Company, any subsidiaries and directors or employees, providing compensation for loss of office or employment \n(through resignation, purported redundancy or otherwise) that occurs due to a takeover bid.\nStakeholders and policies\nSuppliers We recognise the importance of good supplier relationships to our overall success. Further information on our payment practices is on the UK government’s reporting portal.\n Read more about our Supplier Code of Conduct and our engagement with suppliers during the year on page 40\nPolitical donations No political donations or contributions to political parties under the 2006 Act have been made during the year. The group policy is that no political donations be made or political \nexpenditure incurred.\nEvents occurring after \nthe reporting period\nThere have been no important events affecting Johnson Matthey Plc or any subsidiary between 31st March 2023 and the date of approval of this annual report, 25th May 2023.\nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 2023 129\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION\nDirectors’ Report continued\nShareholders and share capital\nAGM Our 2023 AGM will be held on Thursday 20th July 2023 at 11.00 am at Herbert Smith Freehills, Exchange House, 12 Primrose Street, London EC2A 2EG.
