This covers Scope 3 \nemissions from purchased goods and \nservices (‘PG&S’) and capital goods \nfrom around 1,500 partners and \nsuppliers. The majority of our spend \nis with suppliers of fully managed \noutsourced services, IT, professional \nservices and goods and services \nrelated to management of our premises. \nOur indicative supply chain emission footprint data \nis modelled based on current visibility of our supply \nchain and spend data. This baseline provides \ncontext around our current scope of supply chain \nemissions and has not yet been assured.\nOur baseline was calculated using a combination \nof top-down and bottom-up analysis. We used \nenvironmentally extended input-output (EEIO) \nanalysis, where an industry average emissions \nfactor is applied per pound of spend. This was \nsupplemented with CDP data from suppliers \nwhere available. \nImproving data quality\nWe continue to encourage our key suppliers to \nsubmit their carbon emissions data via the CDP \nsuppliers’ survey, with 84% of our surveyed \nsuppliers submitting data in 2022. This data \nenables us to refine our baseline further, identify \nemissions hotspots and identify priority areas  \nfor bespoke supplier engagement. \nWe are currently undergoing an extensive exercise \nto enhance our supply chain spend data quality, \ncategorisation and taxonomy, which will help us to \ncalculate supply chain emissions more accurately. \nIn line with operations and investments, we have \nused 2019 as a baseline for emissions to allow for \nthe highly atypical nature of 2020; however, we \nplan to re-baseline our 2019 footprint to capture \nthese data improvements and potentially more \naccurately account for mergers and acquisitions \nthat have taken place since 2019. We expect  \nto publish updated and assured supply chain \nemission footprint data in the next 18-36 months, \nalongside comparative trends and annual progress \non emissions reduction.\nWithin our 2019 baseline of c. 0.2M tCO 2e our \ntop 100 suppliers account for the vast majority \nof emissions, notably in purchased goods and \nservices category. This is particularly concentrated \nin our top 10 who account for c.65% (figure 28).\nFigure 28: 2019 estimated PG&S emissions assessment based  \non data from the top 755 PG&S suppliers \nThis graph depicts indicative supply chain emission footprint data modelled on current visibility of our supply chain and  \nspend to provide context around our current scope of supply chain emissions, which has not yet been assured. Phoenix Group \nis currently undergoing an extensive exercise to enhance supply chain spend data quality and categorisation and align this \nmore closely with Phoenix Group’s taxonomy within our procurement and finance tools, in order to calculate supply chain \nemissions more accurately.\n100 suppliers are considered to be \nmaterially significant at this stage of \nthe carbon reduction journey. Based on \n2022 available data, we estimate that:\n  Top 10 Suppliers = \nc.65% of PG&S emissions\n  Top 20 Suppliers =  \nc.75% of PG&S emissions\n  Top 50 Suppliers = \nc.85c.% of PG&S emissions\n  Top 100 Suppliers = c.95%  \nof PG&S emissions\nSize up exposure\nSupply chain\n60\nPhoenix Group Holdings plc Net Zero Transition Plan\nInvest Engage Lead\nEmbedding net zero \nin our business\nBecoming a \nnet zero business Measuring our progress\nExecutive \nsummary\n2 Plan the journey\nSupply chain\nOur ambition is to achieve a net zero \nsupply chain by 2050, with an interim \ntarget of halving supply chain \nemissions intensity by 2030. Our goal \nis to reduce underlying supply chain \nemissions intensity by c. 80% by 2050, \nand to ensure that our suppliers offset \nany residual emissions, in line with \nour Group offsetting approach.\nWith a significant spend we can use our \nrelationships with key partners to influence \nbehaviour change and encourage more ambitious \naction around net zero. \nWhile our supply chain data is indicative, it \nnevertheless provides a sound basis for identifying \nour most material emitters, therefore prioritised \nengagement with these will continue to form the \nbasis of our decarbonisation strategy and \napproach. Current modelling is also based on the \nassumption that there is no change to the growth \nand impact of emissions, therefore we are \nexploring whether it is feasible to integrate M&A \nfactors into our decarbonisation modelling from \n2024/5 onwards and to more effectively integrate \nnet zero considerations into our M&A strategy.\nOur top 100 material suppliers (c.80% of our \nsupply chain spend) collectively account for  \nc.95% of these emissions.
