In \nthe case of customers’ scope 3 emissions \nestimates, it must be taken into account \nthat this is a partial estimate, subject to \nthe availability of emission factors made \navailable by the PCAF methodology.\nPCAF offers various levels of quality scores \nwhen calculating financed emissions.
