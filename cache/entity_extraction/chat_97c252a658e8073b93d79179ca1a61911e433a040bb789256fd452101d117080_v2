This \nuncertainty elevates scenario analysis as a critical tool to reflect the broad range of possible outcomes and \nmodel the complex linkages across climate drivers, economic and financial variables, and sector/counterparty-\nlevel responses needed to estimate quantitative impact.   \nDesign choices for Citi’s internal exploratory exercises to date have largely focused on enabling capacity \nbuilding and setting boundary outcomes (e.g., sudden adoption of an overnight carbon tax) to compare \nagainst internal capital binding benchmarks. These internal exploratory exercises encompass portfolio-\nspecific pilots focused on more targeted sectors (e.g., Oil & Gas, Commercial Real Estate) and scaling \ngradually across to Enterprise-wide exercises across all major portfolios. Scenarios have typically included \nmore tractable assumptions such as a globally coordinated carbon tax policy and static balance sheet to \nstreamline analytical and operational challenges as a trade-off to more plausible and realistic scenarios at \nthe outset.  \nWe also recognize that while there is an imperative for a transition to a low-carbon economy, we must \nbe mindful that countries are in different stages of development with different energy and social needs. \nDeveloping markets should be allowed to grow and develop their economies, and they should have more \nleeway to transition to clean energy than developed markets. There also needs to be more investment \nand innovation to help those economies become part of the clean energy transition. It is critical that \nthe low-carbon transition accounts for the priorities for developing countries to increase their access \nto energy, and for workers currently involved in carbon-intensive sectors to continue to maintain their \nlivelihoods and receive support to transition and apply their skills to new technologies and/or sectors.\n46 | TCFD REPORT 2022: CITI’S APPROACH TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND NET ZERO\nMajor regulatory stress tests have been launched in several jurisdictions over recent periods and have \ngenerally been focused on the most systemically important and sizable institutions within each jurisdiction. \nThese stress tests leverage a common set of climate reference scenarios from the Network for Greening \nthe Financial System (NGFS) or Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Citi has met these \nrequirements for each of the legal entities deemed in scope, which are comprised of differing portfolios \nbased on local business footprint and legal vehicle structure. The delivery of these regulatory exercises \nhas further established foundational data, scenario and modeling capabilities, which leverage both external \nand internal analytical platforms.\nInitial internal scenario-based exercises have also been more targeted on heatmapping activities to \nenhance targeted physical risk identification across commercial real estate, residential real estate and our \nown facility/third-party operational risk considerations. Future internal exercises will aim to further enrich \nthe range of outcomes through higher resolution scenarios, internal modeling infrastructure that tailors \nmore to firm-specific climate risks and enhanced data integration to enable more granular risk capture.\nThis proactive approach towards capability enhancements extends to enhancing risk identification to \ninform more tailored scenario narratives, accelerating internal modelling efforts to decrease vendor \ndependency and establishing centralized data architecture to support overlapping climate data needs \nacross the Bank.
