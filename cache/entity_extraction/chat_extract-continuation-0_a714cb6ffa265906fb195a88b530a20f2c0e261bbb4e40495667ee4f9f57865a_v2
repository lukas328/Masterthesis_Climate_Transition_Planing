The ongoing engagement with the most different \ngroups of stakeholders, focusing mainly on our clients, \nis the pathway to identify innovative solutions and \ncapture opportunities towards a low carbon economy. \nWe engage in discussions on climate change in sector \nassociations, advocate this cause before the public \nauthorities, encourage our suppliers to integrate \nthis topic into their business and run awareness-\nraising campaigns among our employees and other \nstakeholders. \nThe third pillar is to reduce impacts and create \nopportunities by adopting any actions required \nto increase the resilience of our business and \noperations to climate change. Here our focus is on \nbusiness impacts. We work mainly with Itaú BBA, which \nis responsible for operating with large and middle-\nmarket companies and throughout the agribusiness \nchain, by setting decarbonization targets for specific \nsectors and sustainable finance, with the development \nof green products, ESG-linked structured operations, \nspecific credit lines and alignment of the portfolio to \nachieve Net Zero by 2050.\nWhen it comes to impacts on operations, our strategy \nis aimed at ecoefficiency projects, emission offset \nprograms, solar energy generation at branches, \ncontingency plans for climate risks and exposure of \nbranches to flooding risks.\n1 2 3\n18 \nItaú Unibanco Holding S.A.climate report 2022\nUnderstanding and assessing \nto apply\nMapping the impacts of risks and \nopportunities \nAs climate risks and opportunities can impact \nour operations and business understanding \nthem is crucial for our strategy. \nClimate risks can be either physical or transition. \nPhysical risks are related to the increase in \nfrequency and intensity of extreme climate \nevents and changes in climate patterns. \nTransition risks meanwhile are associated with \nemission trading and taxation schemes, laws \nand regulations to restrict emissions, climate \nlitigation, technological barriers, changes in \nclient and consumer behavior, etc.\nEffective actions in the present, aimed at \nmitigating climate change, minimize physical \nrisks in the long term. A late climate transition \nimplies increased exposure to physical risks \nin the future, especially if we fail to meet the \ntargets set by the Paris Agreement. \nClimate change also brings in opportunities \nassociated with the development of new \nproducts and services that promote climate \ntransition, participation in carbon markets, \nincreasing business resilience to different \nmitigation and adaptation scenarios and greater \nefficiency in the use of resources.
