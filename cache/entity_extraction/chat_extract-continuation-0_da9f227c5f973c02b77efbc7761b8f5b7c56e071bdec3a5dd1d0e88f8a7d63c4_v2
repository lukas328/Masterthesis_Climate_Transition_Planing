The \nexercise was based on three different \nmodules, with the following contents:\nMODULE 1  \nQualitative questionnaire about the internal \nframework of climate stress testing including \n11 blocks with topics related to governance, \nRAF, integration with the strategy, ICAAP and \nfuture plans\nMODULE 2  \nAnalysis of the current portfolio of entities \nwith respect to revenue dependence on \npolluting sectors6 as well as emissions \nfinanced in such sectors\n6.
