The hourly pension plan \nremains open to future accrual for existing members but the salaried pension plan will be \nclosed to future accrual from 1st July 2023 with plan participants transferring to a defined \ncontribution plan. All new US employees now join a defined contribution plan. \nOther post-employment benefits \nThe group’s principal post-employment medical plans are in the UK and US, and are unfunded \narrangements that have been closed to new entrants for over ten years. \nMaturity profile \nThe estimated weighted average durations of the defined benefit obligations of the main \nplans as at 31st March 2023 are: \n \nWeighted average \nduration\nYears \nPensions: \nUK 16\nUS 10\nPost-retirement medical benefits: \nUK 9\nUS 9\nFunding \nIntroduction \nThe group’s principal defined benefit retirement plans are funded through separate fiduciary \nor trustee administered funds that are independent of the sponsoring company. The \ncontributions paid to these arrangements are jointly agreed by the sponsoring company and \nthe relevant trustee or fiduciary body after each funding valuation and in consultation with \nindependent qualified actuaries. The plans’ assets, together with the agreed funding \ncontributions, should be sufficient to meet the plans’ future pension obligations. \nUK valuations \nUK legislation requires that pension plans are funded prudently and that, when undertaking a \nfunding valuation (every three years), assets are taken at their market value and liabilities are \ndetermined based on a set of prudent assumptions set by the trustee following consultation \nwith their appointed actuary. The assumptions used for funding valuations may, therefore, \ndiffer to the actuarial assumptions used for IAS 19, Employee Benefits, accounting purposes. \nIn January 2013, a special purpose vehicle (SPV), Johnson Matthey (Scotland) Limited \nPartnership, was set up to provide deficit reduction contributions and greater security to the \ntrustee. The group invested £50 million in a bond portfolio which is beneficially held by the \nSPV. The income generated by the SPV is used to make annual distributions of £3.5 million to \nJMEPS for a period of up to 25 years. These annual distributions are only payable if the legacy \nsection of JMEPS continues to be in deficit, on a funding basis. This bond portfolio is held as a \nnon-current investment at fair value through other comprehensive income and the group’s \nliability to pay the income to the plan is not a plan asset under IAS 19 although it is for \nactuarial funding valuation purposes. The SPV is exempt from the requirement to prepare \naudited annual accounts as it is included on a consolidated basis in these accounts.  \nA funding valuation of JMEPS was carried out as at 1st April 2021 and showed that there was a \ndeficit of £9 million in the legacy section of the plan, or a surplus of £24 million after taking \naccount of the future additional deficit contributions from the SPV. The valuation also showed \na deficit in the cash balance section of the plan of £1 million. The next triennial actuarial \nvaluation of JMEPS will be carried out as at 1st April 2024 with the results known later in \nthe year. \nIn accordance with the governing documentation of JMEPS, any future plan surplus would be \nreturned to the parent company by way of a refund assuming gradual settlement of the \nliabilities over the lifetime of the plan. As such, there are no adjustments required in respect of \nIFRIC 14, IAS 19 – The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and \ntheir Interaction. \nUS valuations \nThe last annual review of the US defined benefit pension plans was carried out by a qualified \nactuary as at 1st July 2021 and showed that there was a surplus of $10 million on the projected \nfunding basis.  \nThe assumptions used for funding valuations may differ to the actuarial assumptions used for \nIAS 19 accounting purposes. \nOther valuations \nSimilar funding valuations are undertaken on the group’s other defined benefit pension plans \noutside of the UK and US in accordance with prevailing local legislation. \n \nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 2023184\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION\nNotes on the Accounts continued for the year ended 31st March 2023 \n184 \n24 Post-employment benefits continued \nGroup continued \nThe group operates two defined benefit pension plans in the US. The hourly pension plan is for \nunionised employees and provides a fixed retirement benefit for life based upon years of \nservice. The salaried pension plan provides retirement benefits for life based on the member’s \nlength of service and final pensionable salary (averaged over the last five years). The salaried \nplan benefits attract inflation-related increases before leaving but are non-increasing \nthereafter. On retirement, members in either plan have the option to take the cash value of \ntheir benefit instead of a lifetime annuity in which case the plan has no obligation to pay any \nfurther benefits to the member. \nThe US salaried pension plan was closed to new entrants on 1st September 2013, and the US \nhourly pension plan was closed to new entrants on 1st January 2019.
