Whilst our initial targets and our SBTi \ncommitment were set in 2020 we used 2019 as  \na baseline for emissions to allow for the highly \natypical nature of 2020. This meant that some \ninformation was not as granular as it has become \nin later years. \nTo meet these science-based targets we need to \nfollow a reduction trajectory of about 6.3% per \nyear or 70% by 2030. We have used market-based \nemissions for our targets to recognise the \ncontribution renewable energy makes to our \nNet Zero Transition Plan and to global carbon \nreduction priorities. \nFor additional and remaining Scope 3 categories \n(e.g. upstream leased assets, etc) that we measure \nand report against, we are currently targeting  \nnet zero by 2050 with an interim target of 50% \nreduction by 2030 from the applicable baseline.\nWe are progressing well with our carbon reduction \nstrategy that focuses on energy-efficient \noperations, business travel, renewable energy  \nand carbon offsets and is based on the following \nprinciples as detailed in table 10.\n2 Plan the journey\nOperations\n56\nPhoenix Group Holdings plc Net Zero Transition Plan\nInvest Engage Lead\nEmbedding net zero \nin our business\nBecoming a \nnet zero business Measuring our progress\nExecutive \nsummary\n3 Execute actions\nOperations\nSetting a carbon price to support capital \nexpenditure decisions\nWe have set an internal carbon price (‘ICP’) of \n$100 USD / £90 GBP to inform our operational \ncapital expenditure decisions. The price is in line \nwith recommendations made by the United \nNations Global Compact (‘UNGC’) which suggests \nthat a price of USD $100 is needed to incentivise \nsustainable options, unlock investment and shift \nmarket signals. We intend to continue using the  \nICP to influence the Group’s purchasing decisions, \nfor example:\n• The procurement and consumption of  \ngas (i.e. Scope 1 emissions).\n• The procurement and consumption of  \nelectricity (i.e. Scope 2 emissions).\n• The procurement of goods and services (i.e., \nScope 3 categories 1 and 2) – the ICP would  \nbe used as a tool when choosing capital goods \nand between models of capital goods based  \non their efficiencies. \n• Business travel (i.e., Scope 3 category 6) – ICPs \nwould be used as a way to encourage more \nsustainable decisions and better use practices.\n• New spaces to lease (i.e., Scope 3 category 8).\nOther categories and processes within the \nbusiness (such as waste generated within the \nbusiness or home working) are less likely to  \nbe influenced by using an ICP. \nEvolving our travel policy\nWe saw business travel emissions significantly \nincrease in 2022, up 220% on 2021, reflecting \nan increase in colleague numbers as well as a \ndecrease in travel restrictions across the world.  \n1. First eliminate\nWe have aligned our capital expenditure \nprogramme to our net zero target and re-\nprioritised spend based on the potential carbon \nimpact of the projects we consider, and we use  \nour internal carbon price to incentivise the options \nthat provide the most carbon reduction. \nWe continually review the use of our buildings and \ntake evolving ways of working into account. In some \ninstances we are able to consolidate our buildings  \nas an effective way of eliminating emissions.\n2. Then reduce\nWe see building improvement works as a key action \nneeded to reduce carbon emissions and improve \nenergy efficiency. We have identified several \nprojects that will help reduce energy consumption \nas we advance our strategy. Some of the ongoing \nprojects include:\n• LED lighting roll-out \n• Building and ventilation control  \nsystems upgrades\n• Sub-metering installations\n•  Boiler upgrades, including gas to electric  \nsystem replacements \n• Chiller replacements\nThis fast-growing emissions source represents a \nsignificant challenge, which is why we launched \nour Group Green Travel Policy in 2022. All \nemployees are required to evaluate the necessity \nof business travel and prioritise sustainable travel \noptions where practical. We are working towards a \nminimum of 50% of business travel to be by train/\npublic transport. \nWe have invested heavily in technological solutions \nto allow remote collaborations such as video \nconferencing equipment and software as a way to \neliminate the need for travel altogether. We will \ncontinue to investigate ways to incentivise the use \nof lower-carbon travel options for business trips. \nAdditionally, we offer colleagues a range of \nbenefits to reduce the impact of commuting travel. \nThis includes Cycle to Work scheme in the UK and \nBike to Work Scheme in the Republic of Ireland. \nThese schemes offer bicycle leasing across a \n12-month period with tax/national insurance (NI) \nexemption benefits. The limit has been increased \nto £3,600 in the UK so that more e-bikes are  \nnow covered through the scheme. We have also \npartnered with Octopus Energy to offer UK \ncolleagues a salary sacrifice to lease an electric \nvehicle (‘EV’), including tax/NI exemption benefits. \nWe also continue to incentivise the use of public \ntransport through Season Ticket Loans that offer \nan interest-free amount payable via salary sacrifice \neach month.\nWe will continue to invest in technology such as car \nsharing apps and infrastructure facilities such as \nimproving security of bike sheds and improving \nchanging rooms to enable employees to support \nthis policy. \nWe completed the installation of one of\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
