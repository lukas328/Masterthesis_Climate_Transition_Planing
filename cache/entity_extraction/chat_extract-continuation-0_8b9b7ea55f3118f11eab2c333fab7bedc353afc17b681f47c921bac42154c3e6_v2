It provides technical solutions \nto adjust projects from client construction \ncompanies and real estate developers to more \nsustainable construction processes. The projects \nare periodically audited, aimed at ensuring their \ncompliance to obtain the final certification, \nfostering a more sustainable market and \ntechnical training for real estate developers.\nCPR (Rural Product Note) Legal Reserve +\nIt provides with differential rates agricultural \nproducers who have preserved native vegetation \narea larger than required by legislation and who \ncommit to not engage in deforestation of all \ntheir properties over the term of the operation.  \nEligibility and monitoring throughout the \noperation are checked out by remote sensing \nequipment. Monitoring also aims to ensure \nthat funds are not used to clear new areas in \nother regions.\nWholesale \n39 \nItaú Unibanco Holding S.A.climate report 2022\nAgricultural insurance 100%\nWe sell Agricultural Insurance through partner insurance \ncompanies to protect the rural producer’s crops from planting to \nharvesting, against climate events covered, such as:  fire, wind, \nrainfall and temperature variations, among others. If the rural \nproducer uses Precision Farming, through which the production \nsystem is carried out in a more sustainable way, such producer \nmay be eligible for rate reductions.  \nInvestments\nWe operate through Itaú Asset in structuring ESG funds, \nincluding funds linked to water, clean energy and green \neconomy. We also offer off-the-shelf products with positive \ncontribution to the ESG and climate agendas, which include \ngreen fixed income operations or those issued by companies \nwith good practices.\nFinancing of electric cars\nWe offer differential rates to finance electric cars, as a way of encouraging the \nclient’s choice and reducing the generation of emissions.\nConsortium for electric and hybrid vehicles\nWe made available a consortium for electric and hybrid vehicles to meet the \ndifferent needs of our clients who wish to purchase this type of vehicle.\nSolar panel financing\nThe product aims to facilitate the payment of solar panel installation, which may \nhave a high initial cost, directly contributing to mitigate climate change.\nRetail \nInvestments\nInsurance \n40 \nItaú Unibanco Holding S.A.climate report 2022\nOur work on the carbon market\nIn addition to the products already mentioned, we also have a history of work on and support to the structuring of the carbon market in Brazil, both from the standpoint of products and \nthrough advocacy, as detailed in the box below.\nWe have been operating in the voluntary carbon market for a long time \nWe have operated in this market since 2017 when we started to offset our scopes 1 and 2 GHG emissions by buying credits from the \nClimate Commitment Program. Launched in partnership with renowned institutions, the commitment was a pioneering initiative in \nBrazil, since it connects companies interested in offsetting their emissions with projects dedicated to generating carbon credits with \nsocial and environmental benefits. By supporting over 15 projects, the Climate Commitment records over 22,000 hectares of \nprotected forest and 1 million MWh of renewable energy generated, which resulted in an impact of 1.4 million tCO₂e of emissions \nverified and 1,600 people trained.\nIn 2021, we created a business team specialized in ESG and climate issues, focused on offering climate solutions to our clients, and \nits strategy is supported by three key pillars:  (i) diagnosis; (ii) reduction and removal of emissions; and (iii) management of residual \nemissions.  We want to encourage our clients to increasingly invest in understanding their carbon footprint and identifying projects \nthat may contribute to reduce and/or remove GHG emissions from their activities. In cases in which reducing and/or removing GHG \nemissions is still not possible, we encourage the company to invest in managing their emissions. With this goal in mind, we work \non all fronts, under a one-stop-shop concept for carbon services, which ranges from origination of projects to their sale.  \nIn the origination side, our ESG Business team has the expertise to provide our clients with advisory services to identify both new \nprojects that require financing for reduction and/or removal initiatives, and new carbon credit projects that may be developed and \nmonetized. The team also works on structuring funds and other investment vehicles for carbon projects, allocating capital to this type \nof initiative.  We were the first Brazilian bank to provide advisory services in a merger and acquisition operation in the carbon market, \nas advisors of Carbonext in the sale of ownership interest to Shell. We were also innovative by investing, together with Suzano, Vale, \nMarfrig, Santander and Rabobank, in the creation of Biomas, a new company focused on forest conservation and restoration (for further \ninformation about Biomas, access our ESG Report).\nIn order to sell carbon credits in the voluntary market, we set out, in partnership with other international banks, the Carbon Place, a \ncarbon credit marketplace, aimed to facilitate the access to the voluntary carbon market, promoting higher liquidity and transparency. \nThe platform aims at eliminating some barriers, such as lack of transparency in relation to rates applied in the market and liquidity.  \nOur strategy also includes supporting, in partnership with other market players, the public policies, governance and macroeconomic \nconditions that encourage the generation and trading of high integrity carbon credits in Brazil, positively exploiting the economic \nand environmental potential that this asset can bring to the country.
