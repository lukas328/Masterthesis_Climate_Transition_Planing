Climate transition plan Risk Management and Scenario Analysis Metrics and TargetsIntroduction\nClimate transition plan: Government and \npolicy engagement \nAs noted in section 3.4 there is a significant dependency on timely and appropriate government policies as well as on our customers and society to respond.\nGiven the dependence on timely and appropriate government policies to support our climate ambitions – and those \nof our customers - engagement with the UK Government is key part of our strategy to support the transition net \nzero. Given macro instability in the external environment and the ongoing cost of living crisis, we have focused our \nengagement on heat and buildings and food security, given these sectors have most impact on the day to day lives \nof our customers and that there is significant potential for further evolution of government policy in this space to \nsupport the transition to Net Zero. \nNatWest Group also provided extensive input into the Independent Review of Net Zero led by Chris Skidmore MP, \ncommissioned by the previous Prime Minister, Rt. Hon Liz Truss MP. NatWest Group welcomed the review, which \nconcluded that net zero is the growth opportunity for this century, with the UK well-placed to take advantage, with \nthe potential for 480,000 jobs supported by the transition by 2030. The report makes 129 recommendations across \na wide range of issues of strategic importance to NatWest Group, including Transition Plans, support for SMEs, \nTransport, Agriculture, Skills and Carbon Markets. The review makes several recommendations on energy \nefficiency in line with NatWest Group’s own policy advocacy. Through our work on developing our climate transition \nplan, we have developed a view on key policies required to support homeowners to decarbonise. The policy work is \nsupported by regular engagement with the UK Government and other political and industry stakeholders to inform \nand develop effective policy. The key NatWest Group policy asks on home energy efficiency are: \n • Public awareness campaign on energy efficiency measures; \n • Investment signals, including local area energy planning; \n • All homes sold must be rated EPC C+ by 2033; \n • Support low interest loans to help households improve their performance; and, \n • Introduce an energy saving stamp duty rebate. \nIn 2022, we also worked alongside the UK Government to support the UK Pavilion at COP 27 and hosted high \nprofile events with customers and partners like the Sustainable Markets Initiative (SMI) and WWF. In addition, we \npublished our second thought leadership report, A Springboard to Sustainable Recovery(1), that highlights a \n£175 billion+ revenue opportunity for the UK economy between now and 2030 through the transition to Net Zero. \nFurthermore, we continued to be an active participant in The Sustainable Homes and Buildings Coalition. During Q4 \n2022, the Coalition published its Home Its Home is where the Heat Is: Progress Report(1) , which reiterates the \nCoalition’s call to the government to make energy efficiency a national priority. The report was delivered on the \n19th October 2022 to politicians, industry-leading figures, and charity representatives. \nDuring 2023, we will continue to work with the UK Government as well as peers and industry partners to support \nour customers’ and the UK’s decarbonisation journey.\n‘The need for further action is clear. For all the UK’s \nsuccesses and clear ambition shown by government, it is not \non track to deliver on all of its commitments according to the \nlatest progress report by the CCC, which shows risks across \nmost sectors – but particularly agriculture, aviation, waste, \nand buildings decarbonisation.’\nMission Zero, Independent Review of Net Zero Report by Rt Hon Chris Skidmore MP,  \npublished in January 2023\nNote:\n  During 2022, NatWest Group made no political donations, not incurred any political expenditure in the UK or EU.
