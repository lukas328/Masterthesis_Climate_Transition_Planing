CIRCULAR ECONOMY\nWaste generation is becoming a serious \nproblem at global level, so part of BBVA’s \ncontribution to sustainable development \nmust consist in transitioning linear \nconsumption practices to circular \nconsumption. BBVA has been working for \nmany years to reduce this impact through \nsustainable construction standards and \nthe implementation of ISO 14001-certified \nEnvironmental Management Systems. \nIt has also implemented Aenor’s Zero \nWaste certification in Ciudad BBVA, \nBBVA’s headquarters in Spain. The goal is \nto minimize the amount of waste sent to \nlandfills. The Bank’s facilities have clearly \ndifferentiated and marked areas that enable \nto carry out a proper sorting and subsequent \nrecycling of waste. \nTABLE 12.

CARBON FOOTPRINT\nThe reduction of the carbon footprint is one \nof the goals established within the Goal 2025. \nBBVA’s total emissions are composed of:\n SCOPE 1 GREENHOUSE GAS \nEMISSIONS, comprising DIRECT \nEMISSIONS from own-use property \ncombustion facilities, vehicle fleet fuels \nand refrigerant gases.\n SCOPE 2 GREENHOUSE GAS \nEMISSIONS, including INDIRECT \nEMISSIONS related to the production of \nelectricity purchased for and consumed \nby buildings and branches.\n SCOPE 3 GREENHOUSE GAS \nEMISSIONS, which INCLUDE OTHER \nINDIRECT EMISSIONS At BBVA, this \nscope includes emissions from business \ntravel (by plane and train), emissions \nfrom waste management and emissions \nfrom the commuting of employees from \ncentral services to the work center. \nP.  97\nBBVA Report on TCFD 2022\nThis English version is a translation of the original in Spanish for information purposes only. In case of a discrepancy, the Spanish original will prevail.\nSECTION 04/ METRICS AND GOALS\nBoth Scope 1 and 2 emissions and Scope 3 \nemissions are calculated taking into account \nthe GHG Protocol standard established by \nthe World Resources Institute (WRI) and \nthe World Business Council for Sustainable \nDevelopment (WBCSD).\nBBVA is a neutral company in terms of CO2 \nemissions related to the aforementioned \ncategories and offsets its carbon emissions \nthrough the purchase of credits in the \nVoluntary Carbon Market. Moreover, in line \nwith the recommendations of the T askforce \non Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets, \nBBVA has established requirements for \nthe selection of projects with which to \noffset its residual emissions. Among these \nrequirements are the obligation for projects \nto be certified under the maximum quality \nstandards such as the Verra Verified Carbon \nStandard (VCS) and the Gold Standard, \nAmerican Carbon Registry (ARC), Climate \nAction Reserve (CAR) and Plan Vivo; and \nthat preferably are CO2 absorption or \ncapture projects. The projects selected in \n2022 have been 4 reforestation/afforestation \nprojects (Carbioin, Scolette, Cumare, \nGuarané) and 2 wind farms (Manantiales \nWind Farm and Rotor Elektrik).\n4. SUSTAINABLE CONSTRUCTION\nAnother of the objectives is to guarantee the \nimplementation of the best environmental \nand energy standards in BBVA buildings \nto achieve a large percentage of \nenvironmentally certified surface area. \nIn fact, the BBVA facilities hold a number \nof construction and management \ncertifications.\nAmong the construction certifications, there \nare 16 buildings and 10 Group branches with \nthe prestigious LEED (Leadership in Energy \nand Environmental Design) certificate for \nsustainable construction. These buildings \ninclude the Group’s headquarters in Spain, \nMexico, Argentina and T urkey.
