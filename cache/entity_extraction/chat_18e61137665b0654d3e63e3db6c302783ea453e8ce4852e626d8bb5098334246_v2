Despite challenges, \nmembership in the sector-specific net-zero \nCONTENTS  |  FINANCIAL INSTITUTION NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLANS — FUNDAMENTALS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND GUIDANCE\n99\nalliances is increasing and financial institutions are \ndeveloping and implementing NZTPs, pointing to \nincreased commitment and action to realize those \ncommitments. Figure  22 sets out an illustrative path \nfor how NZTPs could mature in the industry over \nthe next five years.\nRealization of this path will require the widespread \nadoption of NZTPs by financial institutions. \nTo enable this adoption, the financial sector \nrequires increased availability of high-quality \ntransition-related data and transition plans \nfrom real-economy firms; the improvement and \nharmonization of transition planning methodologies \nfrom target setting to reporting standards; and \nnear-term action by policymakers.\nOverall, transition plan implementation should \nincrease financial flows toward the four key \nfinancing strategies outlined in this report, \nultimately supporting the real-economy net-\nzero transition. Over time, the ratio of allocation \nbetween transition finance versus clients and \nportfolio companies who do not fall under the key \nfinancing strategies is expected to evolve as the \nreal-economy transition progresses. For example, \nthere could be a larger allocation to “climate \nsolutions” as opportunities related to solutions \nexpand in number and scale; greater attention \nand allocation to “managed phaseout” as the \npractice becomes mainstream; and expansion in \nthe “aligning” and “aligned” categories as more \nreal-economy, net-zero commitments are made and \nimplemented. Eventually, net-zero considerations \nshould become systemically embedded across the \nfinancial sector.\nTo achieve this, GFANZ encourages financial \ninstitutions to heed the guidance in this report and \ntheir net-zero, sector-specific alliance by developing \nand implementing NZTPs and evaluating their \nstrategies against the four key financing strategies. \nReal-economy firms would also benefit from \nsetting net-zero commitments and developing \nambitious NZTPs, given the scale of the financial \nsector’s commitment to net-zero alignment. For \npolicymakers, establishing clear and consistent \npolicy around transition-related disclosures could \ncatalyze action at the scale needed to realize the \nambition of the Paris Agreement. Cooperation \nbetween all key stakeholders is critical to accelerate \nwidespread development and implementation of \nNZTPs in support of achieving net zero and limiting \nwarming to 1.5 degrees C. \nFor more information, please visit  gfanzero.com\nPlease  see \nSection 1: Executive  Summary  \nSection 3: Supplemental  Information\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
