materially from those expressed or implied in these forward-looking such statements.\nThe most important of these uncertainties and factors that could cause actual results and outcomes to differ

(with special regard to the risk factors in relation \nto ‘Climate and sustainability-related risks’ that describes several particular uncertainties, climate and sustainability-\nrelated risks to which NatWest Group is exposed and which may be amended from time to time).\nOther uncertainties and factors include, without limitation:\n • the extent and pace of climate change, including the timing and manifestation of physical and transition risks, \nthe macroeconomic environment;\n • uncertainty around future climate-related policy, including the timely implementation and integration of \nadequate government policies;\n • the effectiveness of actions of governments, legislators, regulators, businesses, investors, customers and other \nstakeholders to mitigate the impact of climate and sustainability-related risks;\n • changes in customer behaviour and demand, changes in the available technology for mitigation;\n • the roll-out of low carbon infrastructure;\n • the availability of accurate, verifiable, reliable, consistent and comparable climate-related data;\n • lack of transparency and comparability of climate-related forward-looking methodologies; \n • variation in approaches and outcomes – variations in methodologies may lead to under or overestimates, and \nconsequently present exaggerated indication of climate-related risk; \n • reliance on assumptions and future uncertainty (calculations of forward-looking metrics are complex and require \nmany methodological choices and assumptions); and\n • see also, Section 5.7 (‘Cautions about climate-related metrics, data and methodology challenges’) of this report.  \nAccordingly, undue reliance should not be placed on these statements. \nFurthermore, changing national and international standards,
