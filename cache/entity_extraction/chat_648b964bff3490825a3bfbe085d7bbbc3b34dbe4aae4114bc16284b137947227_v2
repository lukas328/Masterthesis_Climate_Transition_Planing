We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped \nus to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect \nof misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole.\nBased on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:\nFinancial statements – group Financial statements – company\nOverall materiality £21.1 million (2022: £21.8 million). £60 million (2022: £60 million).\nHow we determined it Approximately 5% of the three year average profit before tax from continuing \noperations, adjusted for loss on disposal of businesses, gains and losses on \nsignificant legal proceedings, major impairment and restructuring charges\n1% of total assets. However the materiality is capped at £20 million \n(2021: £20 million) for the purpose of the audit of the consolidated financial \nstatements, this being the maximum allocation of group materiality to \na component\nRationale for benchmark \napplied\nAdjusted (underlying) profit before tax from continuing operations is used \nas the materiality benchmark excluding amortisation of acquired intangibles \nand share of losses from associates. Management uses this measure as it \nbelieves that it reflects the underlying performance of the group and this \nis how the directors and key management personnel are measured on their \nperformance. We did not adjust profit before tax to add back amortisation \nof acquired intangibles or share of losses of associates as in our view these \nare recurring items.\nWe considered total assets to be an appropriate benchmark for the parent \ncompany given that, whilst it does include trading businesses, it is the ultimate \nholding company, incurs corporate costs and enters into financing on behalf \nof the group. The materiality level was capped at £20 million given overall \ngroup materiality for the purposes of the audit of the consolidated financial \nstatements, this being the maximum allocation of group materiality \nto a component.\nFor each component in the scope of our group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall group materiality. The range of materiality allocated across components was between \n£1 million and £20 million. Certain components were audited to a local statutory audit materiality that was also less than our overall group materiality.\nWe use performance materiality to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds overall materiality. Specifically, \nwe use performance materiality in determining the scope of our audit and the nature and extent of our testing of account balances, classes of transactions and disclosures, for example in \ndetermining sample sizes. Our performance materiality was 75% (2022: 75%) of overall materiality, amounting to £15.8 million (2022: £16.3 million) for the group financial statements \nand £15 million (2022: £15 million) for the company financial statements.\nIn determining the performance materiality, we considered a number of factors – the history of misstatements, risk assessment and aggregation risk and the effectiveness of controls – and concluded \nthat an amount at the upper end of our normal range was appropriate.\nWe agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £1 million (group audit) (2022: £1 million) and £1 million (company audit) \n(2022: £1 million) as well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.\nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 2023 139\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION\nIndependent auditors’ report to the members of Johnson Matthey Plc continued\nConclusion relating to going concern\nOur evaluation of the directors’ assessment of the group’s and the company’s ability \nto continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included:\n• Evaluation of management’s base case and downside case scenarios, understanding \nand evaluating the key assumptions, including assumptions related to inflation and other \nmacro-economic factors;\n• Validation that the cash flow forecasts used to support management’s impairment, going \nconcern and viability assessments were consistent;\n• Assessment of the historical accuracy and reasonableness of management’s forecasting;\n• Consideration of the group’s available financing and debt maturity profile;\n• Testing of the mathematical integrity of management’s liquidity headroom, covenant \ncompliance, sensitivity and stress testing calculations;\n• Assessment of the reasonableness of management\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
