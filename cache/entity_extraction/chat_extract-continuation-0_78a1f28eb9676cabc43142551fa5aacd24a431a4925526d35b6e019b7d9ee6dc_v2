In the short term (12-18 \nmonths), it is considered that an accelerated \ntransition to a low-carbon economy would \nentail a medium-impact risk event, although \nthe probability currently given to this type \nof scenario is medium low. At a medium/\nlong-term time horizon, the risk of physical \nclimate change is included in the inventory \nof emerging risks (those that may have an \nimpact on a longer horizon) and is assigned \na medium risk.\n2/ Risk level assessment: The second \napproach followed in risk assessment is \nbased on an assessment of the profile \nof each type of risk expressed in a heat \nmap. In 2022, the analysis was extended \nto the six relevant geographical areas \nof the BBVA Group (Spain, Mexico, \nT urkey, Argentina, Peru and Colombia). \nThe financial year incorporates risk \nfactors, such as the carbon footprint \nof customers, the energy efficiency of \nreal estate collateral and the emissions \nfinanced, to name a few. Work has also \nbeen done on the preliminary inclusion \nof quantitative metrics for certain risk \nfactors, especially exposures to activities \nthat are sensitive to transition risk \n(include table of indicators). \nThe conclusions of the assessment for \n2022 suggest that the main risks emerge \nin medium- and long-term loan portfolios, \nwith an earlier impact on transition risk in \nSpain given the speed of this geographic \narea in adopting decarbonization policies. \nIn contrast, there has been a reduction in \nrisk due to regulatory pressure in emerging \ngeographies. The factor that has the \ngreatest impact in the long term on credit \nrisk is that derived from the investments in \ntechnological change that companies will \nhave to carry out in order to decarbonise. \nWith respect to the impact of physical risk \nP.  55\nBBVA Report on TCFD 2022\nThis English version is a translation of the original in Spanish for information purposes only.

Also \nnoteworthy is the increase in medium-term \ninsurance risk associated with the increase \nin reinsurance premiums, which may have \nan impact in the medium term, although the \nlevel of risk remains at a medium-low level.\nThe impact of transition risk on liquidity risk \nis low due to the stability of the retail deposit \nbase and the high asset quality of the liquid \nasset buffer. Market risk is equally low, due \nto the diversification of the equity portfolio \nand low exposure to sectors sensitive to \ntransition risk in the fixed-income portfolio. \nAs for operational risk, there is a difference \nin the perceived risk in Spain (medium-\nlow) and in the rest of the geographic areas \n(medium-high), due to the greater exposure \nof the latter to physical risk in the medium \nand long term.\nTABLE 04.
