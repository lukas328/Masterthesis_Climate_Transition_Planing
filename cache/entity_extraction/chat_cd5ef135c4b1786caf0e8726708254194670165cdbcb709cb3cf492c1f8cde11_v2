We’ve also just announced a broader package \nof health and wellbeing initiatives, Viva, to help our \npeople worldwide and this will be rolled out across \nBupa this year. Our thoughts are with everyone \nimpacted by the tragic recent earthquakes in Türkiye \nand Syria. As the recovery efforts continue, our team \nin Türkiye has been working hard on a support package \nfor those in need, including customers and colleagues. \nThrough our business in Poland, we have been \nproviding free healthcare support to Ukrainian refugees \nwho have been forced to flee the war over the past \nyear. We’re clear that we will continue to fund this \nsupport for as long as needed. \nOutlook \nWe are seeing continued strong demand for our \nproducts and services to meet changing customer \nneeds, particularly digital access to healthcare. Through \nour 3x6 strategy, we are focused on expanding the \navailability of these services across all of our markets. \nWe are encouraged by the positive overall performance \nacross the Group and how our businesses are \ntransforming while continuing to deliver for our \ncustomers. High inflation continues to increase costs \nfor our businesses and for our customers, although we \nare encouraged by the customer growth we have seen. \nThe recruitment and retention of healthcare workers \nremains an ongoing sector-wide challenge in multiple \nmarkets – impacting our health provision businesses, \nnotably UK dental and some aged care businesses. \nIn Chile, as noted on page 11 ongoing judicial and \nregulatory uncertainty continues to affect the Isapre \nindustry creating a challenging operating environment \nfor our Isapre business. We are confident in the future \nand see positive momentum behind the implementation \nof our strategy. There is much to do but we are well-\npositioned to meet rising demand for healthcare \nservices across all our markets. \nIñaki Ereño \nGroup CEO \nBupa Annual Report 2022 6 \n \nStrategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements \nProgress on our 3x6 strategy \nProgress against our ambition KPIs: \nIn 2021, we introduced the 3x6 strategy. Our main focus \nlast year was driving progress against three headline \nelements of that strategy - all of which aim to ensure \nthat Bupa will become the most customer-centric \nhealthcare company in the world. \n1. We have made progress in increasing the customer\ncare touchpoints that we own (vs. a global goal of\nowning 40% of touchpoints) - driving more frequent\ninteraction with customers and giving us more ways\nto improve their access to great quality healthcare.\n2. We have meaningfully increased the percentage of\nour customers who we interact with digitally (vs. a\nglobal goal of 60%) - enabling us to serve customers\nhow they want to be served, and to offer anytime\nand immediate access to Bupa.\n3. We have improved NPS scores across most of our\nbusinesses (vs. a global goal of 80 NPS) - showing\nthat our focus on implementing high volumes of\ncustomer experience improvements is delivering\nactual benefits to our customers.\nThis positions us well for 2023, when we plan to make \nsignificant further progress vs. our '40:60:80' targets. \nSet out below are some examples from across our \nbusinesses which illustrate the progress made in 2022. \nExamples of progress against our ambition KPIs \nDouble-digit \ngrowth \nBupa Arabia \n+13 ppts\n40% 60% \n 80 \nCustomer care touchpoints Active digital Net Promoter \nowned by Bupa Score of 80 customers \nDouble-digit digital \ncustomer growth rates \nBupa Chile \n+28 ppts\nTürkiye \n+22 ppts\nBupa Arabia \n+13 ppts\nAround 82% \nBusiness Units have increased \ntheir scores, with particular \nNPS improvements in \nHK Health Services \n+15 pts\nAustralia Aged Care \n+13 pts\nUK Aged Care \n+9 pts\nGood \nimprovement \nBupa Mexico \n+5 ppts\nBupa Global \n+4 ppts\nBupa Annual Report 2022 7 \n \n \nStrategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements \nProgress against our six strategic \nand enabling pillars: \nIn our 3x6 strategy, we established six key strategic and \nenabling pillars - areas of focus for our business-wide \ntransformation activities. \nWhile our transformation journey is not yet complete, \nour people have focused their energy on - and \ndelivered at pace across - all six pillars. We have \nmade measurable progress and have put in place \nbusiness fundamentals that will allow us to go \nfurther and faster in 2023. \nAn overview of tangible progress against these pillars \nis set out below. \nWe also have several initiatives under way to improve \nour organisational capabilities to support delivery of \nour goals across each strategic and enabling pillar. \nThese include: \n1.
