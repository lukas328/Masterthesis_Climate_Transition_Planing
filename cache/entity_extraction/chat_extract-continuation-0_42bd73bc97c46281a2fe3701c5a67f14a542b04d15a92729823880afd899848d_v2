Appendix \n \n-4- Mizuho Financial Group \n \n \nClimate change is a crucial global issue, one we must \nsolve to continue living securely on our planet and look \nforward to a brighter future. Mizuho has included \nresponding to climate change as a key pillar of our \nbusiness strategy, and we are harnessing our group’s \ncapabilities to contribute to the achievement of a low-\ncarbon society by 2050. \n \nIn recent years, action on climate change has progressed \nrapidly, bringing with it considerable transformation. The \nUN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow (COP26) last \nyear saw the adoption of the Glasgow Climate Pact, which \nreaffirms the goal of “pursuing efforts to limit the \ntemperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels”. \nThe trend towards a low-carbon society is gaining even \ngreater momentum and becoming an irreversible structural \nchange. Alongside our clients in industry and our fellow \nfinancial institutions, we have been making ceaseless \nefforts to respond to it. \n \nIn order for us to make progress with our clients toward \nour shared goals of achieving a low-carbon society and \nsustainable development, our business execution and \nsupervisory lines have sought advice from outside experts \nand engaged in thorough discussions, which have led us to clarify our goal of reaching net zero by 2050 and \nour actions for this goal. While aiming for an orderly, just transition, we will pursue efforts to limit the \ntemperature increase to 1.5°C. \n \nIn this regard, one of the major roles we have to play as a financial institution is to support our clients in \nintroducing climate change countermeasures and transitioning to a low-carbon society. The road to transition \nwill vary by business location and industry type. There is also a need to give adequate consideration to \nimportant issues such as energy security and stable power supply. At Mizuho, we understand that our \nstakeholders, most prominently our clients, find themselves in differing environments and situations. We are \ntaking these into account together with the required transition time frame, the underlying science, and the \nimpacts on the economy and society and moving forward our transition support initiatives. \n \nKey to this is constructive dialogue with our clients, also known as engagement, and a combination of \nfinancial and non-financial support. We are capable of working with our clients to design comprehensive \nstrategies for transitioning to a low-carbon society, based on a deep understanding of their challenges and \nneeds, and our strength lies in providing optimal solutions to our clients by seamlessly connecting the wide-\nranging functions of our group companies in banking, trust banking, securities, asset management, leasing, \nand consulting. Maximizing our capabilities to support our clients’ strategies for decarbonization is our \nresponsibility and mission. \n \nEffective government policies and the development of next-generation technology are essential for the \ntransition to net-zero emissions. For industry, particularly carbon-intensive sectors, a steady transition entails \nmassive capital demands, which must be met. Mizuho has been advancing innovative initiatives in this area. \nFor example, we have been supporting development of technology in the proof-of-concept trial phase through \na transition investment budget. We have also been a front-runner in developing the fields of sustainable \nfinance, in which we are aiming to provide a total of ¥25 trillion by 2030, and transition finance, which has \n1.
