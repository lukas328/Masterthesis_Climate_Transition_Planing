For example, if the \ncommittee set a broader range of EPS targets than in prior years this may result in threshold \nvesting being as low as 0% as opposed to 15% (or higher) for that part of the award.\n• Given our refreshed strategy will require investment over the coming years there will be \nno defined ROIC underpin applied to future PSP awards.

New or promoted executive directors may receive higher pay increases \nthan typical for the group over a period of time following their appointment as their pay trends toward an appropriate \nlevel for their role.\nMaximum opportunity\nNo salary increase will be awarded which results in a base \nsalary which exceeds the competitive market range considered \nappropriate by the committee for the role.\nDetails of the current salaries for the executive directors \nare included in the Annual Report on Remuneration on \n(see page 119).\nBenefits\nBenefits are provided to support \nthe director in his or her \nperformance in the role. They \nhelp to remove certain day-to-day \nconcerns from executive directors, \nto allow them to focus on \nmanaging and directing the \nbusiness. In general, benefits will \nbe restricted to the typical level \nin the relevant market for an \nexecutive director. \nBenefits include, but are not limited to, medical, life and income protection insurance, medical assessments, company \nsick pay, and a company car (or equivalent).\nOther appropriate benefits may also be provided from time to time at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.\nDirectors’ and officers’ liability insurance is maintained for all directors.\nDirectors who are required to move for a business reason may, where appropriate, also be provided with benefits such \nas relocation benefits (e.g. the provision of accommodation, transport or medical insurance away from their country \nof residence) and schooling for dependants. The company may pay the tax on these benefits.\nDirectors may be assisted with tax advice and tax compliance services.\nThe company will reimburse all reasonable expenses (including any associated tax charges) which the executive \ndirector is authorised to incur while carrying out executive duties.\nBenefits are not generally expected to be a significant part \nof the remuneration package in financial terms.\nCar benefits will not exceed a total of £25,000 per annum.\nThe cost of medical insurance for an individual executive director \nand dependants will not exceed £25,000 per annum.\nCompany sick pay is 52 weeks’ full pay.\nPension\nProvides for post-retirement \nremuneration, ensures that the \ntotal package is competitive \nand aids retention.\nAll executive directors will be eligible to participate in a company pension plan and/or paid a cash supplement in lieu \nof membership in a pension plan. \nThe maximum company contribution is 15% of base salary for \nexecutive directors. This is aligned to the typical cost of providing \npension benefits to other employees in the UK.
