In 2022, we were included once again in \nthe Climate Resilience Index (ICDPR70), launched by CDP \nLatin America, the international organization responsible \nfor gauging the environmental impact of companies and \ngovernments.\nIn 2022, we recorded a 23% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 \nemissions compared to 2021, as well as a 26% reduction \nin our absolute GHG emissions in relation to the baseline \n(2019). The performance of BRF emissions was impacted \nby the reduction of the energy GRID emission factor in \nBrazil, leading to a reduction in BRF’s Scope 2 emissions in \n2022, when compared to 2019, and by the strategy imple-\nmented by BRF to prioritize clean and renewable sources \nwhen acquiring energy.\n26%\nreduction of Scope 1 and 2 \nabsolute GHG emissions\nThe mapping, measurement and management of the \nemissions of the value chain (Scope 3), represents a \nchallenge for any organization, and for BRF it is no \ndifferent. We are aware of the importance of these \nemissions and have identified the chain links of priority \nimportance and the main initiatives that can contribute to \na reduction in our emissions. In 2022, we made advances \nin the mapping of more than 10 categories applicable to \nthe value chain, whilst a mitigation ‘roadmap’ is currently \nunder development.\nAs such, the sources of Scope 3 emissions measured \nby BRF currently refer to the upstream logistics, the \nexternal treatment of waste, and business trips. In 2022, \nwe recorded a 5% increase in Scope 3 GHG emissions, \nin relation to the baseline (2020), and a 0.2% increase \nin relation to 2021, this having been influenced by the \nresumption of business trips following the slowdown \ncaused by the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as the increase \nin the amount of waste sent for external treatment in the \nform of composting.\n104\nValue Generation5\nOur way of \ndoing business\nOur strategy\nCulture and \nEngagement\nIndicators  \nand annex\n3\n4\n6\n2\nPresentation1\n2022 Integrated  \nReport\nEnergy\nOur commitment to increasing our use of electricity \ngenerated by clean sources by 50% by 2030 has been \na priority for our investments over the last decade. This \nmeasure can be added to our actions concerning efficiency \nand the energy transition to renewable sources involving our \nentire operation and the chain as a whole - actions which are \nalso driving our commitment to Net Zero.\nCurrently, 90% of the energy consumed (fuels and electricity) \nby BRF is drawn from renewable sources, 31% of the \nelectricity consumed comes from clean sources (solar and \nwind), whos 24%* comes from market based sources.he \nmeasurement of energy measured in the production units \nand 24% comes from tax-deducted energy.
