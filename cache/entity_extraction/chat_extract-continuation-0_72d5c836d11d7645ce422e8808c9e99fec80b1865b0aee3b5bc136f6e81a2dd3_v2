While \nthis may result in some sectors being assigned a vulnerability score that is higher than the average of \nall climate risks, we have decided to take this more conservative approach in order to recognize that the \nsector is exposed to climate risks up to that highest level under our methodology.\nOur heatmap assessment helps us to prioritize portfolios when further evaluating the risks within each \nbusiness unit. We intend to initially focus on the higher-risk, higher-exposure sectors. However , additional \ndue diligence will be required to differentiate the vulnerabilities of individual counterparties within \neach sector (taking into consideration differences in business models, geographic footprint and climate \nadaptation and/or mitigation plans).\nIt is important to note that these risks are not expected to manifest in every sector immediately. For this \nreason, the table on pages 54 to 56 should not be interpreted as imminent risks to existing exposures, but \nrather , exposures we are proactively identifying to focus on, where we will work methodically in the coming \nyears to better understand, analyze and manage our climate risk exposures in these sectors.\nA comprehensive table of our credit exposures is provided below, including a further detailed breakdown of \nidentified sectors into subsectors and, for each, the level of risk relating to physical and transition climate \nrisk. By looking at the subsector level, we can further distinguish between the levels of risk within an \nindividual sector .\nWe note that since our 2021 TCFD Report, there have been minor updates within the table, but there have \nbeen no substantial changes to our heatmap as we have been prioritizing climate risk assessments focused \non more vulnerable sectors. \n1 2 3 4\nPhysical \nRisks\nAcute \nHazard\nAcute physical \nhazards have no \nimpact on the day-\nto-day operations \nof companies in the \nsector\nSector would \nexperience minor \nimpact from acute \nphysical hazards \non operations (e.g., \nrevenue loss due to \nbusiness disruption), \nor minor damage to \nassets (e.g., asset \ndevaluation)\nSector would \nexperience moderate \nand protracted \nimpact from acute \nphysical hazards \non operations (e.g., \nrevenue loss due to \nbusiness disruption), \nor moderate damage \nto assets (e.g., asset \ndevaluation)\nSector would \nexperience major \nand protracted \nimpact from acute \nphysical hazards \non operations (e.g., \nrevenue loss due to\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>REGULATORY/POLICY CHANGES<|><|>EVENT<|>Changes in laws or policies such as building efficiency standards, carbon taxes, or other regulations that impact the sector's operations and financial performance)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SECTOR<|><|>ORGANIZATION<|>The sector refers to a specific industry or economic segment affected by regulatory/policy and technology changes, with impacts on asset valuation, expenditures, and revenue)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TECHNOLOGY<|><|>EVENT<|>Modernization or shifts in technology affecting the sector's operations, market share, and economic dynamics)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STAKEHOLDER<|><|>ORGANIZATION<|>Entities such as investors, customers, or regulators whose preferences and composition influence or are impacted by sector changes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEGAL<|>EVENT<|>Legal concerns including litigation risks, legal fees, and settlements that can impact the sector's financial health)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>REGULATORY/POLICY CHANGES<|>SECTOR<|>Regulatory and policy changes directly influence the sector's operations, asset valuation, and revenue<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>SECTOR<|>Technological shifts can cause market share loss or operational changes within the sector<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STAKEHOLDER<|>SECTOR<|>Changes in stakeholder preferences or composition can significantly impact the sector's financial outcomes<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LEGAL<|>SECTOR<|>Legal concerns such as litigation can impose financial burdens on the sector<|>5)\n##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
