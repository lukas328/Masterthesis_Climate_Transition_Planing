We will work closely alongside \nour top 10 material suppliers and the most \nmature suppliers to support them to \ndecarbonise at a faster rate from 2024 onwards. \nThis engagement strategy will function as \na dedicated data-driven decarbonisation \nworkstream that sits alongside our current  \nnet zero asks of key suppliers.\nOur proposed carbon reduction levers  \nfor the top 100 material suppliers include: \n• Developing category-led decarbonisation \nstrategies, prioritising those categories which \nrepresent the highest share of our current \nfootprint – IT, outsourced business processes, \nincluding policy fulfilment and adminstration \nand professional services\n• Collaborating around category-led \nmitigation and reduction strategies  \nwithin their own business\n• Aligning on sustainable strategic sourcing \napproaches and supplier provisions to assess \nrisks and opportunities to identify priority \nmaterials or critical commodities\n• Supporting with identification of energy \nefficiency and emission reduction \nopportunities – focusing on impactful and \ncost-effective projects and report reductions\n• Understanding renewable energy options \nacross our supply chain and supporting \nsuppliers to overcome lingering barriers\n• Integrating net zero ESG clauses to help  \nratify our commitment and drive positive \nbehaviour change among our supplier  \nbase in terms of net zero.\nWe understand that this is a significant \nchallenge, and we are committed to working \nwith our suppliers in a supportive way to achieve \nour collective ambitions together. We will also \nmeasure the progress from our top 100 material \nsuppliers against clear targets that support the \ndelivery of our net zero targets.\n62\nPhoenix Group Holdings plc Net Zero Transition Plan\nInvest Engage Lead\nEmbedding net zero \nin our business\nBecoming a \nnet zero business Measuring our progress\nExecutive \nsummary\nBuilding net zero considerations into  \nour supplier management processes\nSustainable strategic sourcing\nAs we continue to build out visibility of our supply \nchain, we want to start proactively tackling those \nareas which present the most material risk. With  \nthis in mind, we are in the process of developing  \na series of category-led sustainable sourcing \nstrategies and principles in high-risk and high-value \ncategories to tackle the emissions hot spots in  \nour supply chain which directly correlate with  \nour most carbon-intensive spend. \nIntegrating carbon pricing into our sustainable \nsourcing strategy and purchasing decisions \nIn line with the planned introduction of an internal \ncarbon price (‘ICP’) across our operational capital \nexpenditure decisions, we are looking to shift \nconsumption away from emissions-intensive \npurchased goods and services towards more \nsustainable alternatives via the introduction of \ncarbon pricing into our sustainable sourcing \nstrategy and purchasing decisions. We are looking \nto identify which parts of our supply chain to \ntarget, covering those purchased products and \nmaterials that could contribute most to achieving \nour defined objectives. We will then look to \ndetermine how an ICP should influence decisions \nwithin our procurement processes and supply \nchain management so that it has a material impact. \nBased on our procurement scenario planning and \nfindings, we will seek to set optimal carbon prices \ndepending on category impact, the nature of the \nproduct or service and sourcing location. \nMake net zero business as usual for procurement\nWe know that sourcing and procurement is the \nprimary way that we can positively impact our \nsupply chain emissions. To complement our ESG \nSupply Chain Standards, we are hoping to \nintegrate quantitative strategic net zero criteria in \nsupplier selections and sourcing decisions. In the \nlonger term, we will translate our net zero ESG \nambition into robust management objectives,  \nkey performance indicators and new operational \napproaches to the core business, starting with  \nthe third-party management risk policy.\nStrategic third-party engagement model\nAs a business we have a number of strategic \nsupplier relationships which are key to our success \nboth commercially and in terms of ESG. With this  \nin mind, we have refreshed our partnership \nengagement model (‘PEM’) to ensure that it \nsupports effective lasting partner relationships \nwhich drive positive, value-adding outcomes for \nPhoenix Group’s customers, shareholders and \nstakeholders. The PEM will act as a single joint \ngovernance to drive excellent customer service \nand to support relevant change programmes, \nincluding our decarbonisation supply chain strategy.\nUpskilling relevant colleagues\nOur procurement and supplier management \ncolleagues are central to delivering our robust \nbespoke supplier engagement. As such, we have \nrolled out initial internal training to these colleagues \non climate and related nature and biodiversity issues, \nand are now developing a suite of further training. \nWe will also engage more widely with relationship \nmanagers and employees across the Group to \namplify our net zero impact in terms of supplier \nengagement, and support more responsible and \nemissions-friendly procurement decisions.\nA key partner to Phoenix, Milliman provides \nintegral cloud-based solutions which support \nour actuarial activities and solutions.\nAn important element of our relationship over \nthe last year has been to collaborate closely  \nto align on Phoenix’s climate change strategy, \nfirst outlined in our open letter to key suppliers \nin December 2021. Through regular \nengagement, we assisted Milliman on its \ncarbon reduction journey by providing our \nperspectives on the commercial and wider \nbenefits that positive environmental action \nwould have on their business. In addition,  \nwe shared supplementary information on the \nimportance of net zero in the fight against \nclimate change and practical tools to help \nMilliman as they were developing their own \nambitious net zero targets. This included \nguiding Milliman towards the SBTi framework \nand explaining how it could support Mill\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
