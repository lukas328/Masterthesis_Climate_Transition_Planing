These relate to contracted capital expenditure. Contingent liabilities \nare those that are considered possible at year end, whose existence will be \nand determined by an uncertain future event or, a present obligation that is not \nsufficiently probable or cannot currently be measured with sufficient \nreliability to give rise to a provision. contingencies \n(i) Capital commitments \nCapital expenditure for the Group contracted as at 31 December 2022 but for which no provision has been made \nin the Consolidated Financial Statements amounted to £40m (2021: £68m). Of this, £40m (2021: £67m) relates to \naged care facility and retirement village project commitments in Australia and New Zealand and care homes in the \nUK; specifically £21m (2021: £29m) in relation to property, plant and equipment and £19m (2021: £38m) in relation \nto investment property. \n(ii) Contingent assets and liabilities \nThe Group currently has no contingent assets. \nThe Group has contingent liabilities arising in the ordinary course of business. These include losses which might \narise from litigation, consumer matters, other disputes, regulatory compliance (including data protection) and \ninterpretation of law (including employment law and tax law). It is not considered that the ultimate outcome \nof any contingent liabilities other than the item below will have a significant adverse impact on the financial \ncondition of the Group. \nIn December 2022, a ruling was issued by the Supreme Court in Chile that obliges Isapres to make use of a table \nof risk factors (used to adjust the price of insurance contracts based on risk factors such as age) prepared by the \nChilean Superintendent of Health in 2019. Like other Isapres, Isapre Cruz Blanca uses product-specific risk factor \ntables rather than the statutory table. The ruling requires the statutory table to be applied going forward, and \nthat where the statutory table is applied to previous contracts entered into over the previous 3 years, the excess \namount is to be returned to the customer to the extent the application of the statutory table results in a lower price \nthan that price charged during that period. Any retrospective payments finally determined to be due in respect of \nhistoric policies as a result of this ruling would be liabilities for Isapre Cruz Blanca. \nThe calculation of the impact of the ruling is not possible without detailed application guidance which needs to \nbe specified by the regulator. The Chilean Superintendent of Health has six months to determine how to apply this \nruling to Isapre businesses and there is currently significant uncertainty around how it will be applied and therefore \nits potential impacts. In the absence of the necessary application details, Bupa Chile is unable to reliably estimate \nthe value of the future retrospective payments, therefore, no provision has been recognised as at 31 December \n2022. The regulator has confirmed publicly that as at 31 December 2022, the Isapres are not able to reliably \nestimate the amount and this should be disclosed as a contingent liability considering the requirements of IAS 37. \nThere are a broad range of possible outcomes in respect of the potential retrospective payments arising from the \nrecent Supreme Court decision, however, in contrast to the requirements of IFRS, under Solvency II the Group is \nrequired to include a value for contingent liabilities, even if the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with \nsufficient reliability. The Group has included an allowance of £100m for this contingent liability for retrospective \npayments within the Solvency II regulatory balance sheet.
