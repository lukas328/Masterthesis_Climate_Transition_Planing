In order to do our best for \nour customers, we need to take care of our people, and \nthis will lead to strong and sustainable performance \nto enable us to deliver our purpose. \nThe Board monitors culture in a number of ways, \nincluding direct workforce engagement (described \nfurther below) and regular people-related items on \nits agenda including: \n▪ Measuring our people’s engagement level and how \nthey embody Bupa’s values through our People Pulse \nsurvey tool and considering recommendations to \nmanagement in response to the survey results \n▪ Regularly considering the level of, and themes arising \nfrom, reports received through our Speak Up \nwhistleblowing process \n▪ Leadership development, talent and succession, \ninclusion and diversity, and employee wellbeing. \nThe Board has also received specific updates on culture \nand initiatives helping drive change in Bupa’s culture \nto more agile ways of working to deliver on the 3x6 \nstrategy. In 2023, the Board will receive regular updates \non 'Changemaker', a global initiative which is being \nestablished to create more capacity for Bupa to both \nrun and change. More information on some of these \ninitiatives can be found in the People and Culture \nsection on page 18. \nListening to and engaging our people \nListening to the views of our people and engaging with \nthem on matters important to them is key to our culture \nand values. The results of our People Pulse surveys are \nconsidered by the Board and have led to a number of \ninitiatives, including the introduction of Viva, described \nunder Supporting our people above. The results of \nPeople Pulse surveys carried out during the year, and \nViva are described in more detail in the People and \nCulture section on page 20. \nWe want our people to see the Board as accessible \nand approachable. With the travel restrictions in place \nduring the COVID-19 pandemic having been largely \nrelaxed, we have resumed our programme of arranging \nsite visits for Directors to different parts of the Group. \nThese visits provide an invaluable opportunity for our \npeople to ask questions directly to the Board and for \nthe Directors to gain an insight into the issues \nimportant to our people in various parts of the \nbusiness. This helps enhance decision-making and \nconsideration of the longer-term impact of the \nBoard’s decisions on our people. \nBupa Annual Report 2022 54 \n          \n         \n        \n         \n          \n          \n        \n         \n    \n       \n       \n        \n        \n        \n         \n        \n         \n       \n        \n         \n         \n        \n        \n          \n          \n      \n          \n       \n         \n        \n       \n          \n       \n      \n            \n    \n      \n        \n            \n        \n         \n     \n        \n          \n        \n        \n    \n        \n         \n       \n         \n        \n           \n         \n         \n     \n      \n        \n        \n   \n     \n        \n           \n          \n         \n        \n        \n        \n        \n   \n    \n         \n           \n       \n        \n       \n       \n          \n        \n        \n      \n         \n    \n  \n       \n       \n       \n      \n      \n       \n      \n       \n       \n     \n      \n     \n       \n  \n     \n  \n        \n     \n       \n      \n        \n        \n         \n    \n      \n         \n      \n       \n    \n          \n \n   \nStrategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements \nLeadership continued \nThis year, a group of our NEDs visited our Australian \nbusiness where, as well as meeting with executives to \ngain deeper insights into the business, they attended \na number of customer-facing sites, including a dental \nclinic, aged care facility and a hospital where they were \nable to talk to frontline staff.
