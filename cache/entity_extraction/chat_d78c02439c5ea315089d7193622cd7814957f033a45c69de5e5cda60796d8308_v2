Where a specific default score is not available for a single \ninvestment, average default probabilities for instruments with a similar credit rating are used. Determining when \nan issuer is in financial difficulty and that a lifetime ECL allowance is required, requires the use of judgement. The \nGroup considers a number of factors including economy wide and industry specific risk factors, issuerâ€™s financial \nand liquidity position, near-term prospects, credit rating declines and known breaches of contracts in determining \nfinancial difficulty. \nWhen there is objective evidence of impairment of a financial asset as a result of one or more events and the event \nhas an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the assets that can be reliably estimated, the Group considers \nsuch investments as credit impaired. To the extent that an investment is impaired, it is written down to its \nrecoverable amount, measured as the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the original \neffective interest rate on the instrument. Subsequent recoveries in excess of the written-down carrying value \nare credited to the Consolidated Income Statement. \nThe investment profile (including financial investments, restricted assets and cash and cash equivalents) as at \n31 December is as follows: \n2022 2021 \nÂ£m Â£m \nInvestment grade counterparties 4,541 4,209 \nNon-investment grade counterparties 697 599 \nTotal 5,238 4,808 \nInvestment grade counterparties include restricted assets of Â£117m (2021: Â£158m).
