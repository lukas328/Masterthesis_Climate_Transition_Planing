In FY2021, we performed another qualitative \nevaluation of risks and opportunities. The results of the new evaluation led us to add steel and cement, which we identified as \nhigh transition risk sectors, to our list of carbon-related sectors and begin undertaking risk control in them (For details on the \nqualitative evaluation, see page 38). \n \nIn addition, we strengthened our handling of cases in which we do not see progress from our engagement, with the aim of raising \nthe effectiveness of our engagement and restraining climate-related risk for both our clients and Mizuho. \nTable 9: Details of strengthened risk control in carbon-related sectors \n(Underlined parts indicate strengthened elements) \n \n(3) Exposure in high-risk areas \nOur credit exposure in high-risk areas (electric utilities, oil, gas, coal, steel, and cement) has declined from ¥1.8 trillion as of March \n31, 2021 (in electric utilities, oil, gas, and coal) to ¥1.6 trillion 15 as of March 31, 2022.
