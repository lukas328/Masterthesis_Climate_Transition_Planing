Bupa’s status as a \ncompany without shareholders means that we can \nfocus on the long-term achievement of our purpose \nand reinvest our profits into providing more and \nbetter healthcare for the benefit of current and \nfuture customers. \nWhen making decisions, the Board takes into account: \n▪ The likely long-term impact of the decision \n▪ The interests or concerns of, and impact on, \nour key stakeholders \n▪ The impact of our decisions and operations \non the communities in which we operate and \nthe environment \n▪ The need to maintain a reputation for high \nstandards of business conduct. \nEngaging with our key stakeholders \nWe consider our customers, people, Association \nMembers (AMs), bond investors, suppliers and \nregulators to be our key stakeholder groups, and \ntheir views and concerns are taken into account in \ndeveloping our business model and strategy. \nThe Board endeavours to gain an understanding of the \nperceptions and attitudes of each stakeholder group \nand the weight they give to different issues. Where the \nviews of different stakeholder groups do not align, the \nBoard must decide on the best course of action to \npromote Bupa’s long-term sustainability and success. \nIt is important for all levels of the business to engage \nwith stakeholder groups to gain a better understanding \nof their interests and concerns and the impact our \ndecisions have on them. \nMore detail on how we engage with our key \nstakeholder groups or where to find more information \nis set out below. \nCustomers \nOur ambition is to be the world’s most customer-centric \nhealthcare company and our three ambition KPIs all \nrelate to our customers, putting them at the heart of \neverything we do and making them our most important \nstakeholder group. \nThe Customers section on page 17 sets out the priorities \nthat we have focused on in 2022 and provides examples \nof the improvements we have made to our customers’ \nexperience in different parts of Bupa. Our customers \ninclude individuals, companies and governments. \nDirect customer feedback is an important tool to help \nus improve their experience and our leaders in all areas \nof the business are encouraged to use our Customer \nListening app to gain insights on the issues that \ncustomers raise and to provide feedback to the \nbusinesses across Bupa on how customer experiences \ncould be improved. \nThe Board has received regular updates during 2022 \non the progress against the three ambition KPIs and the \nproject to drive customer experience improvements. \nPeople \nWe want our people to feel engaged and empowered \nto deliver great outcomes for our customers, to feel \nthat Bupa is a great place to work and to be healthier \nand happier. Our Global People Framework sets out the \npriorities that we focus on, taking into account both the \nexternal employment context and the needs of our \npeople, and is shared with the Board annually for its \nreview and endorsement. \nOur employee engagement results are shared and \ndiscussed with the Board twice a year. Three Non-\nExecutive Directors have been designated to engage \nwith our people in the UK, Australia and Spain - our \nthree largest markets - and they participate in a series \nof events in those markets throughout the year. These \nare usually in the form of site visits, sessions with \nPeople teams, town hall meetings with employees and \nsmaller group events where open dialogue and Q&A is \nencouraged. Their findings are regularly reported back \nto the Board.
