processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risk continued\nThis table provides highlights of key progress and priorities for the principal risks with relatively significant impacts from climate risk. To provide comprehensive assessment of risks to NatWest Group’s strategy, scenario analysis has been \nused to assess the impacts to the following principal risks: conduct risk, operational risk, pension risk, market risk, liquidity and funding risk and capital risk – see section 4.2a. While climate change has the potential to pose significant risks, \nit also offers NatWest Group a range of opportunities to support customer transition to net zero. For details of our climate-related opportunities, see section 3.1 of this report.\n56NatWest Group plc | 2022 Climate-related Disclosures Report\nGovernance Strategy and Climate transition plan Risk Management and Scenario Analysis Metrics and TargetsIntroduction\nOur processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risk continued\nNatWest Group’s climate risk policy and defined maturity standards were reviewed during 2022 and enhanced to ensure that it continues to accurately reflect the risk management principles which \nNatWest Group is aiming to achieve to manage climate-related risk effectively. In line with policy, NatWest Group seeks to effectively identify and assess climate-related risks through three principles:\n1. Undertaking scenario analysis to \nunderstand the potential impacts of \nclimate-related risks\n2. Identifying segments of our portfolio and operations with heightened climate-\nrelated risk exposure\n3. Assessing individual customer’s and supplier’s climate-related risk exposure\nWe conducted a range of scenario \nanalyses during 2022:\n • CBES\n • Conduct risk\n • Pension risk\n • Market risk\n • Capital risk\n • Liquidity and funding risk.\nWe have continued to develop our internal \nscenario analysis capabilities to reduce \ndependence on third-party models.\nDetails of this and our broader \nscenario analysis work can be \nfound in section 4.2a\nWe have developed an increasingly quantitative methodology to consistently identify \nand assess sectors and subsectors exposed to heightened climate-related risk.\n • During 2022, a granular review of climate-related risk exposure was completed at a subsector level, \nreflecting the variability of subsector exposure to climate-related risk within a sector.\n • The quantitative subsector level outputs from climate scenario analysis form the foundations of the \nmethodology. For the latest assessment, the No Additional Action and Late Action scenarios used in \nour internal scenario analysis, carried out to support participation in the CBES exercise, were the \nstarting point to assess subsector exposure to physical risk and transitional risk respectively. For \ndescriptions of these scenarios see page 59. \n • Other climate data available to NatWest Group was then applied to provide additional insight of \nphysical and transition risk exposure. These additional data considerations include external sector \ntransition risk assessments and supply chain dependencies on trade with countries subject to physical \nrisks. We also considered the financed emissions rate for the subsector.\n • This approach identified 44 subsectors exposed to heightened climate-related risk, increasing to 47 \nwithin 17 wholesale sectors, following a qualitative overlay applied by internal subject matter experts.\n • The development of this enhanced, granular view of climate-related risk exposure at subsector level \ncreates potential for more robust consideration of climate-related risk during customer decisioning\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
