Our baseline serves as \nthe starting position for our \ndecarbonisation journey and is the \nreference point from which we will \ndetermine progress. It also provides \nus with important information about \nwhere we should prioritise our \ndecarbonisation activities. \nWe use current industry best practice to help \ndetermine our carbon emission baseline, and  \nhave adopted the current industry standard \nmethodologies as developed by the Partnership \nfor Carbon Accounting Financials (‘PCAF’).\nOur 2019 baseline of 24 million tonnes CO 2e^ \nconsists of 15 million tonnes from our listed equity \nand credit¹1 portfolio and 9 million tonnes from \nour sovereign debt and real estate portfolios. \nBetween 2019 and 2021 these emissions reduced \nby c.15%, largely driven by our listed equity and \nlisted credit¹ portfolio financed emissions reducing \nfrom c.15 million tonnes CO2e a to c.12 million \ntonnes CO2e. \nWe believe this reduction is largely a result of the \neconomic slowdown due to Covid-19.
