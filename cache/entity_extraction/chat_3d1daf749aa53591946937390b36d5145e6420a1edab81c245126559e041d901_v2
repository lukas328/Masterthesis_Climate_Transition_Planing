Reconciling client data from data vendors with Mizuho’s internal credit data \n Issue: In merging the company emissions and EVIC data we obtained from data vendors with Mizuho’ s internal credit \ndata, we needed to perform reconciliation using codes for each client. For companies in Japan, we were able to make \nthe securities code the key for the merge. For companies outside Japan, because our internal data does not include the \nrelevant code, we needed to make the company name the key. Some company names are similar or abbreviated, and \nreconciling the data based on company names proved to be extremely labor intensive. \n Response: We reconciled client data one-by-one, excluding data that was low priority due to the size of the balance or \nother reasons. With this measurement process we were able to organize ticker information, and we expect to be able \nto perform reconciliation more efficiently going forward. \n \n \nCEO message\nOverview/Introduction\nGovernance\nStrategy\nRisk management\nMetrics and targets\nConclusion\nAppendix\n \n-72- Mizuho Financial Group \n \nc. Reconciling sector classifications \n Issue: To come up with usable data, we needed to match the sectors in Mizuho’ s internal credit data (which are the \nsame as in the industry type classification established by the Bank of Japan), the TCFD recommended disclosures \n(which has no set classification method), and the PCAF database (which applies multiple classifications, including GICS, \nNAICS, and NACE). \n Response: We linked each sector after confirming the adequacy of the match. For the TCFD sectors and PCAF \ndatabase sectors, we based the matching on GICS codes. \n \nd. Integrating the PCAF database’s region-specific emission factors \n Issue: The PCAF database includes emission factor data (to use in making estimates based on revenue or assets) for \na range of countries and regions. This allows financial institutions to make estimates in line with their own country-\nspecific portfolios. On the other hand, there is considerable variation in the values of emission factors for different \ncountries (e.g. a gap of 3,000x between the minimum and maximum), and applying the emission factors as they are \nruns the risk of producing estimates removed from reality. \n Response: We consolidated PCAF’s country-specific data into six world regions and calculated emission factors for \neach region (the average of emission factors for the countries in each region). We linked this with the location of the \nheadquarters for each of our clients. \n \ne. Obtaining project data \n Issue: Measuring project emissions from project finance for power generation projects requires project data such as \npower output and capacity factors. While such data was available internally in individual departments, it was not \ncentralized. \n Response: We centralized the project data necessary for measuring project emissions, as well as attribution factor data \nfor each project. Going forward, we will update the data each year as necessary and add more projects subject to \nmeasurement. In this way, we will streamline our management of such data. \n  \n  \nTCFD Report 2022  -73- \n \n2.
