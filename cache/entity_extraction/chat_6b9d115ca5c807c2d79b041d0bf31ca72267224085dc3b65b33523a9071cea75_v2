Approach to climate change and plans \nIn April 2020, we established our Environmental Policy under the Mizuho Code of Conduct in order to clarify our stance on climate \nchange as well as our environmental awareness and specific actions that we will take on environmental initiatives, including those \ntargeting climate change, as we work toward transitioning to a low -carbon society. We have been implementing such initiatives \non a group-wide basis. In April 2021, we revised our Environmental  Policy, clarifying our contribution to achieving a low -carbon \nsociety by 2050, our support for the objective of the Paris Agreement, and our transformation to a portfolio aligned with the targets \nin the Paris Agreement. \n \nIn taking concrete steps forward w ith our response to climate change as outlined in our Environmental Policy, we are pursuing \nefforts to limit the rise in global temperature to 1.5°C. To this end, we formulated Mizuho’ s Approach to Achieving Net Zero by \n2050, which demonstrates our aims and actions towards realizing a low-carbon society by 2050, and the Net Zero Transition Plan, \nwhich indicates the direction of our initiatives. \n \nBased on these policies and plans, we are implementing initiatives responding to climate change, including supporting our clients’ \nefforts to transition to a low-carbon society, and are disclosing information in line with the TCFD Recommendations. \n \nEnvironmental Policy (excerpt) \nEfforts to address climate change \n \nWe recognize climate change as one of the most crucial global issues with the potential to impact the stability of financial \nmarkets, representing a threat to the environment, society, people’s lifestyles, and businesses. \n \nAt the same time, we believe there are new business opportunities arising from t he need to transition to a low -carbon \nsociety, such as the field of renewable energy and other businesses and innovations which contribute to mitigating and \nadapting to the impact of climate change. \n \nMizuho supports the Paris Agreement’s objective to “strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change”. \n \nIn light of this, we have included responding to climate change as a key pillar of our business strategy and will take the \nfollowing actions in order to proactively fulfill our role as a financial services group in the effort to achieve a low -carbon \nsociety (achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions) and to develop a climate change-resilient society by 2050. \n We are directing finance flows towards achievement of the Paris Agreement targets to limit the global average \ntemperature rise, and we are undertaking phased transformation to a finance portfolio aligned with said targets. \n We will engage in proactive, constructive dialogue in response to our clients’ individual concerns and needs, and in \nsupport of their efforts to introduce climate change countermeasures and transition to a low-carbon society in both \nthe medium and long term. \n We will proactively develop and offer financial products and services designed to support clients’ efforts to introduce \nclimate change countermeasures and transition to a low-carbon society. \n We understand the importance of climate-related financial disclosures, and we utilize the framework under the \nRecommendations of the TCFD in order to leverage growth opportunities and strengthen risk management as well \nas disclose information in a transparent manner regarding our progress. \n \nMizuho’s Approach to Achieving Net Zero by 2050 (Formulated in April 2022) \nMizuho’s goal \nClimate change is one of the most important global issues, and it cannot be addressed unless all countries and all \nstakeholders make efforts to reach the same targets. It is necessary that responses to climate change be based on the best \navailable science, including the expertise of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). \n \n4. Strategy \nCEO message\nOverview/Introduction\nGovernance\nStrategy\nRisk management\nMetrics and targets\nConclusion\nAppendix\n \n-22- Mizuho Financial Group \n \nMizuho recognizes that the impact of climate change would be much less if the global temperature were to increase by \n1.5°C instead of 2°C. We believe that the next ten years will be crucial in terms of limiting the rise in temperature to the \n1.5°C target. This is why we are pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to this amount. As part of such efforts, \nMizuho is aiming to become carbon neutral for Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by FY2030, and to reduce \nScope 3 GHG emissions produced via our finance portfolio to net zero by 2050. \n \nWe recognize that abrupt, disorderly changes can have severe economic and societal impacts. Accordingly, at Mizuho, we \nare aiming for an orderly, just transition. \n \nMizuho’s steps to achieving net-zero emissions \nAt Mizuho, we recognize the importance of the role financial institutions play in achieving a net-zero real economy. Financial \ninstitutions should support clients’ climate change countermeasures and the transition to a low-carbon society. This support \nshould be grounded in an understanding that the transition process will differ by location and industry type. In order for us  \nto fulfil our role as a financial institution, Mizuho conducts engagement with clients\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
