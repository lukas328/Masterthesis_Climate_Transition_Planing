Volkswagen contracts a line of credit linked to an ESG commitment , February 5, 2022.\n98 Bradesco. Climate Change Management at Bradesco , June 2022.\nIn 2020, Banco Bradesco S.A. structured the first green export credit note in the Brazilian market. 94\nBradesco worked with Companhia Brasileira de Aluminio (CBA), a vertically integrated aluminum company, on a \nBRL 250 million credit note — a loan to exporting clients — to support CBA to reduce the carbon footprint of its \naluminum production.  \nLoan proceeds are targeted toward CBA projects that improve environmental indicators involving, among other \nbenefits, the reduction in the carbon emissions per ton of aluminum produced. The use of proceeds will adhere to \nthe criteria of CBA’s Green Financing Framework,95 which was developed with technical assistance from Bradesco. \nThe aluminum company’s framework received a second-party opinion from SITAWI96 that indicates capital raised will \nbe allocated to projects and assets with a positive environmental impact, aligned with international best practices \n(Green Bond Principles, Green Loan Principles, and United Nations Sustainable Development Goals [UN SDGs]).\nThe green export credit note to CBA was Bradesco 's first ESG-labeled operation and shows how its investment \nbank unit is engaging with, and financing, clients in the transition to a low-carbon economy, consistent with \nGFANZ recommendations. Bradesco is working to develop further customized solutions to help corporate clients \nachieve their objectives and environmental goals through loan operations as well as in the capital markets. \nSimilarly, Bradesco supported Volkswagen with a BRL 500 million green export credit note, which ensures that \nthe vehicle manufacturer is committed to reduce its Scope 1 GHG emissions by 12% by replacing 20% of natural \ngas consumption with biomethane by 2024, and achieve 25.6% of women in leadership positions, ensuring at least \n24.8% of women in management and executive management positions, by 2024. 97 \nAs for other net zero-supportive products and services, Bradesco is one of Brazil’s main financial agents for \nrenewable energy projects (in 2020, it advised on 15 operations focused on generation, transmission, and \ndistribution of energy from renewable sources). It also participates in a program offering loans with special \ninterest rates for farmers to remediate pastureland and forests and adopt farming technologies that help reduce \nGHG emissions, and it offers a direct-to-customer loan product for solar power equipment. 98 \nIMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY\nCONTENTS  |  FINANCIAL INSTITUTION NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLANS — FUNDAMENTALS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND GUIDANCE\n42\n \nExample 4.
