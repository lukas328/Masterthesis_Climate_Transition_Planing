These \nmetrics may include the proportion of GHG portfolio \nemissions reduction that are a result of changes in \nportfolio composition and those by changes in the \nunderlying companies.272\nWhere carbon credits are used by financial \ninstitutions or their clients, financial institutions \nshould monitor how credits are used and the type \nand quality of credits. The use of credits should be \nmonitored alongside, but separate from portfolio \nemissions. Financial institutions should consider \nspecifying whether credits are being used to \nneutralize residual emissions or to compensate \nemissions beyond emissions reduction targets on \n272 Where the portfolio changes significantly, a recalculation of the baseline may be needed. Both the GHG Protocol  and PCAF \nStandard call for a policy to define the circumstances that trigger a recalculation. There are additional data consistency \nconsiderations in such cases.  \n273 See the Financial Institution Net-zero Transition Plans â€” Supplemental Information report for additional information on ongoing \ninitiatives to define standards for the use and quality of carbon credits.
