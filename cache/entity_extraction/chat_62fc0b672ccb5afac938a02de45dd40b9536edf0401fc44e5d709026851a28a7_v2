Accordingly, there is a lack of commonly accepted \nreporting practices for NatWest Group to follow or align to and climate-related measures between organisations in \nour industry may be non-comparable. \nIn addition, the maturity of underlying data, systems and controls that support non-financial reporting is generally \nconsiderably less sophisticated than the systems and internal controls for financial reporting and it also includes \nmanual processes. This may result in non-comparable information between organisations and between reporting \nperiods within organisations as methodologies develop. The further development of accounting and/or reporting \nstandards could materially impact the performance metrics, data points and targets contained in this report and \nthe reader may therefore not be able to compare performance metrics, data points or targets from one reporting \nperiod to another, on a direct like-for-like basis. NatWest Group plans to continue to review available data sources \nand enhance its methodology and processes to improve the robustness of its climate-related reporting over time \naligned with recognised industry developments. \nFurther to the above, there is currently no single globally recognised or accepted, consistent and comparable \nset of definitions or standards (legal, regulatory or otherwise) of, nor widespread cross-market consensus: \n • as to what constitutes, a ‘green’, ‘social’ or ‘sustainable’ or having equivalent-labelled activity, product or asset; or \n • as to what precise attributes are required for a particular activity, product or asset to be defined as ‘green’, \n‘social’ or ‘sustainable’ or such other equivalent label; or\n • as to climate and sustainable funding and financing activities and their classification and reporting.\nTherefore, there is little certainty, and no assurance or representation is given that such activities and/or reporting \nof those activities will meet any present or future expectations or requirements for describing or classifying funding \nand financing activities as ‘green’, ‘social’ or ‘sustainable’ or attributing similar labels. We expect policies, regulatory \nrequirements, standards, and definitions to be developed and continuously evolve over time.\nCaution about references to websites. \n • Reference to websites and other reports is made for information purposes only, and information found at such \nwebsites or in such reports is not incorporated by reference into this report.
