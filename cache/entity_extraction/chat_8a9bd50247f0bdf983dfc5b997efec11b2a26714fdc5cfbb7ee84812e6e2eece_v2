Vodafone UK \nalso plans to install rooftop solar photovoltaic \non additional sites across the UK over the next \nfew years. \nNatural gas for heating \nWe’re committed to gradually reducing our \nreliance on natural gas for heating and hot \nwater in our office and technical facilities. \nInstead, we’re transitioning to electric heat \npumps and point-of-use water heaters. This \ntransition will be completed over the next \nthree years.\nDiesel generators \nEliminating the use of diesel generators is \nextremely challenging due to the need for \nemergency, temporary, and standby power. \nTherefore, we are currently transitioning \nour generators to operate on biofuel, \nhydrotreated vegetable oil, and/ or hybrid \nmodes (battery and/ or solar).

We are further investigating and beginning to use alternative \nrefrigerant gases with lower Global Warming Potential (GWP) during routine \nequipment replacement or refurbishment. Given that lower GWP gases can be \ntoxic or flammable, we are monitoring innovations in low GWP refrigerants and \nevolving F-gas regulations. We aim to replace 61% of our stored volumes by the \nend of the financial year ending March 2025.\n \nElectric car and van fleet \nWe are transitioning our fleet to electric vehicles (EV) and will be fully EV across \nour car fleet by 2026. We are closely monitoring advancements needed in \nbattery technology that are expected to occur within this timeframe.

In 2018 Vodafone Group carried out a materiality assessment to determine its most significant Scope 3 emissions. None of \nthe five categories that the UK Government has mandated to be included in this Carbon Reduction Plan were deemed to be \nmaterial for Vodafone. Vodafone’s main Scope 3 emissions relate to goods and services we purchase, energy-related services, \nconsumer use of sold products and investments. As a result, we did not record Scope 3 data for the categories that UK \nGovernment has requested in our baseline year.  \n3. https:/ / ghgprotocol.org/ corporate-standard  \n4. https:/ /www.gov.uk/ government/ collections/ government-conversion-factors-for-company-reporting  \n5. https:/ / ghgprotocol.org/standards/scope-3-standard\nDeclaration and sign off\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
