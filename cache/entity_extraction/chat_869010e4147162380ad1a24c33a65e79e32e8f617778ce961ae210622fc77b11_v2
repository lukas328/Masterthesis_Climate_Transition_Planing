Where differences in operations within a sector can \nresult in a different emissions profile, we have used \nsubsector level financial forecasts e.g. within the land \ntransport sector, forecasts for road, rail and passenger \ntransport were separately assessed.\nA Finance working group was set up with representatives \nfrom financial planning, climate and business finance \nteams to ensure linkage between the initial iteration of \nour Climate transition plan and the financial plan. Climate \nmetrics and initial Climate transition plan outcomes were \nalso incorporated in the financial planning governance \nand approval process.\nWe will continue to enhance the linkage between \nour Climate transition plan and the financial plan \nduring 2023.\nAs outlined in the Mission Zero, Independent Review of \nNet Zero Report by Rt Hon Chris Skidmore MP, \npublished in January 2023, “Net Zero is the growth \nopportunity of the 21st century and “the UK must act \ndecisively to seek the economic opportunities and smooth \nthe transition”. The report also outlines how net zero will \ndrive widespread changes to the global economy \nincluding how we heat our homes, generate electricity, \ntravel and produce food. Aligned with this, and our \nambition to be a leading bank in the UK to help address \nthe climate challenge, work to develop the initial iteration \nof our climate transition plan included an assessment of  \nproducts, services and business model changes to \nsupport our customers’ and the UK’s transition.\nThe following variables are considered within the \nTransition Risk Calculator methodology:\n • Emissions intensity (direct and through supply \nchain): the higher the emissions intensity the \nlarger the carbon cost impact on that sector\n • Cost of abatement: sector-specific current and \nprojected marginal abatement cost curves to \nestimate cost effective abatement across different \nsectors\n • Ability to pass through cost increases to \nconsumers: elasticity of demand and potential to \npass through costs determines how sensitive \noutput prices are to cost increases as a result of \nclimate policy\n • Recycling of government carbon tax revenues: \nin some scenarios government might collect \nsignificant carbon tax revenues, which can be used \nto stimulate demand in selected sectors\n • Demand destruction/demand creation: direct \nprojections of demand for different types of high \nand low carbon goods and services related to the \nparticular policy scenario; for example could be \ntaken from the Network of Central Banks and \nSupervisors for Greening the Financial System \nscenarios.\nTransition Risk \nCalculator \nWe have focused the initial iteration of our Climate \ntransition plan on developing plans to support the \ntransition of our customers in key sectors linked to \nproperty, energy, mobility and food systems as these \nhave most impact on the UK’s carbon footprint and our \ncustomers’ day to day lives.
