Response to the Commissioner’s Questions of March 15, 2021, About Investor Interest in the Financial Impact of Climate \nChange, June 9, 2021.\nImpax Asset Management is a UK-based asset management group working to demonstrate its commitment to \nreaching net-zero GHG emissions by 2050, in line with global efforts to limit warming to 1.5 degrees C. Since its \ninception in 1998, Impax has invested in companies and assets that lead or benefit from the transition to a more \nsustainable economy. Impax sees active engagement as a key part of its role and collaborates with clients and \nothers to create policies supportive of a low-carbon, sustainable economy. \nImpax has established a Global Policy Group, with a dedicated lead and senior membership including the CEO.  \nThe group brings together expertise from across the firm to implement a rolling three-year advocacy plan \nfocused on engagement with policymakers in Europe and the United States. Impax deploys a variety of advocacy \napproaches, ranging from traditional interventions (e.g., consultations and sign-on letters) to more proactive \nactivity (e.g., publishing perspectives and funding research). Impax also applies its environmental markets \nexpertise to stimulate innovation in science and technology, such as through its CEO’s role as an independent \ndirector on the UK government’s Net Zero Innovation Board . \nIn the last two years, Impax has focused its activities on financing the energy transition; nature-based solutions; \nphysical climate risk; and greening the finance industry. In early 2020, Impax produced a Clean Investment \nRoadmaps white paper ,238 which called for governments to make investment opportunities more explicit \nby breaking down their national climate goals into clear sectoral roadmaps. The white paper also called on \npolicymakers to establish dialogues with investors and other key stakeholders on the design of policies likely  \nto attract finance into the solutions needed in each sector.\nImpax actively contributed to commitments and calls to action that emerged at COP26, including: \n• the Investor Agenda Global Investor Statement to Governments on the Climate Crisis ,239 which calls for \ngovernments to strengthen their NDCs to align with a transition to net zero; commit to a clear decarbonization \nroadmap for each carbon-intensive sector; implement domestic policies to incentivize private investments; and \ncommit to mandatory climate  disclosures;\n• the Energy Transitions Commission (ETC) report Keeping 1.5 degree C Alive: Closing the Gap in the 2020s ,240 \nwhich set out the key actions needed, sector by sector, to deliver the Paris Agreement; and\n• various “coalitions of the willing” that committed to ambitious global action in key sectors (e.g., the PPCA,  \nthe Natural Capital Investment Alliance, investor commitment to deforestation-free portfolios, and NZAM).\nDuring 2021, Impax also advocated in favor of improvements to the regulation of climate-related disclosures. \nIt was a lead author of the Climate Financial Risk Forum’s Climate Data and Metrics report 241 whose \nrecommendations were referenced in the FCA’s subsequent consultation on TCFD implementation. In response \nto the SEC’s request for inputs on climate disclosure, Impax submitted a set of detailed recommendations 242 that \ninformed the SEC’s proposed rule published in March 2022. \nENGAGEMENT STRATEGY\nCONTENTS  |  FINANCIAL INSTITUTION NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLANS — FUNDAMENTALS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND GUIDANCE\n77\n \nOverview and relevance: This report acknowledges \nthat specific metrics and targets methodologies \nmay be more suited to a certain sector or net-zero \nfinancing approach. As well, the report recognizes \nthere are challenges in using certain metrics, and in \nthe availability and quality of data. Some of these \nchallenges, including the early stage of metrics \nrelated to the four key financing strategies, are \ndiscussed in the \"Expansion of metrics and targets” \nand “Data” sections in the Financial Institution Net-\n243 Scope 3 should be included at minimum for high-emitting sectors, such as the priority sectors identified in the Net Zero Asset \nOwners Alliance target-setting protocol, which include Oil and gas; Utilities (including coal); Transport (civil aviation, shipping, \nand road transport); Materials (steel, cement, and aluminum); Agriculture, forestry, and fisheries; Chemicals; Construction and \nbuildings; Water utilities; and Textiles and leather. Financial institutions should consider other sectors for Scope 3 that are \nproportionally material to their financed emissions and where data allows. Financial institutions should also refer to their sector-\nspecific alliance for guidance. ( NZAOA. Target Setting Protocol Second Edition ).\n244 Recall that this report uses “financed emissions” and “portfolio emissions” interchangeably.\nzero Transition Plans — Supplemental Information \nreport.
