This is due to the recoverable amount on a value in use basis reducing to £221m driven by an increase in \nWACC rates in the period from 7.8% to 10.5% and a deterioration of the underlying forecast cash flows of the \nbusiness. \nCash flow assumptions are highly sensitive to available clinician hours and to operating expenses. Future medium \nto long-term cash flow forecasts have been reduced in light of the ongoing under-performance of the business. \nOperational challenges have increased in the second half of 2022 due to below target recruitment and retention \nof clinicians and increasing wage and energy costs. \nAfter impairment, Bupa Dental Care UK has a remaining goodwill balance of £191m. This remains sensitive to further \nimpairment should the key assumptions move adversely as shown in the table below. \nReduction in \nReduction in headroom Reduction in \nheadroom from 0.5% headroom \nfrom 0.5% reduction in from 10% \nTerminal increase in terminal reduction in \nHeadroom Discount rate growth rate discount rate growth rate cash flows \n£m % % £m £m £m \nBupa Dental Care UK – 10.5 2.1 (21) (17) (22) \nBupa Care Services \nAn impairment of goodwill of £90m has been recognised for the Bupa Care Services CGU in 2022, writing off \nthe goodwill balance to £nil. This is due to the recoverable amount on a value in use basis reducing to £796m \npredominantly driven by the increase in the WACC rate in the period from 7.0% to 8.5%. \nBupa Villages and Aged Care Australia \nBupa Villages and Aged Care Australia has recognised an impairment of goodwill of £103m in 2022, writing off \nthe goodwill balance to £nil. This is due to the recoverable amount on a value in use basis reducing to £296m. \nThis reduction has been driven by the increase in the WACC rate in the period from 9.8% to 10.3%, along with \nupdates to the cash flow assumptions. The cash flow assumptions remain highly sensitive to the recovery of \noccupancy and staff costs. Staff cost forecasts have been negatively impacted by the inclusion of the cost \nof implementing minimum mandatory care minutes for residents, which the Australian Federal Government \nis bringing into force from 1 October 2023. \nBupa Chile \nThe Bupa Chile CGU operates domestic health insurance businesses (primarily an Isapre business) and health \nclinics and hospitals in Chile. An impairment of £139m has been recognised in respect of the Bupa Chile CGU \nin 2022, writing off the goodwill balance to £nil. This is due to the recoverable amount on a value in use basis \nreducing to £481m driven by increased WACC rates and reductions in future cash flow forecasts reflective of the \nlocal pressures on the Isapre industry that has been negatively impacted by judicalisation of premium pricing and \nregulatory action. In addition to the goodwill impairment, Bupa Chile has recognised a £22m impairment of brand \nassets relating to the Isapre element of the business in Chile (Isapre Cruz Blanca). The Group has recognised a \ncontingent liability following a Chile Supreme Court ruling in December 2022 in respect of risk factor tables used \nby Isapre Cruz Blanca. This does not impact the impairments noted as the relevant intangible balances have been \nfully impaired in 2022.
