At the same time, any financing to \nfossil fuel companies — to ensure continuity of \nenergy supply in the interim — should consider the \ntimelines in a science-based 1.5 degrees C pathway \nto ensure the energy sector continues along \na net-zero transition and is not supporting the \ndevelopment of assets that will be stranded. \nGFANZ urges financial institutions to be aggressive \nwhen developing their net-zero strategies, as the \nnext few years are crucial for the state of climate \nchange.

For GFANZ members, \na transition plan should be consistent with \nachieving net zero by 2050, at the latest, in line \nwith commitments and global efforts to limit \nwarming to 1.5 degrees C, above pre-industrial \nlevels, with low or no overshoot. 59, 60, 61\nNet-zero transition plans are foundational to \noperationalizing commitments and demonstrating \nthe credibility of a financial institution’s net-zero \npledge. A transition plan is both a strategic planning \ntool and a practical action plan. It translates an \ninstitution’s net-zero commitment into specific \nobjectives and actions that are aimed at reducing \nreal-economy GHG emissions. A transition plan \nsupports accountability and signals to both internal \nand external audiences that an institution’s steps \ntoward net zero are deliberate, transparent, and   \ncan be monitored. It also illustrates to stakeholders \nthat a financial institution is taking the transition \nrisks it faces seriously, working to mitigate them  \nas the transition to a net-zero economy progresses. \nThe breadth of a net-zero transition plan requires \nrevisiting strategies, governance, incentives, and \nother fundamental business considerations. The \nfour key financing strategies provide a lens through \nwhich an institution can review its entire business. \nThe review should assess how the allocation of \ncapital\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
