In case of a discrepancy, the Spanish original will prevail.\nSECTION 02 / STRATEGY\nResilience of the \nstrategy against \nclimate change risks\nThe concept of climate resilience requires \nthat organizations develop the adaptive \ncapacity to respond to climate change, \nleveraging opportunities and managing the \nassociated transitional and physical risks.\nTCFD recommends that organizations \ndescribe the ability of their strategy to \nleverage opportunities related to climate \nchange, consistent with a scenario of orderly \ntransition to a low-carbon economy, but \nalso their resilience to possible scenarios of \nincreased climate risks.\nAs mentioned in the section \nDefinition of risks and opportunities associated with  \n climate change  BBVA’s strategy may be \naffected by climate-related risks and \nopportunities.\nTherefore, BBVA is working on measuring \nthe impact of different climate scenarios, \nboth transition and physical risks, on its \nstrategy and business.\nThe first results, obtained in the framework \nof the Climate Stress T esting regulatory \nexercise promoted in 2022 by the ECB, show \nimmaterial impacts on both transition risk \nand physical risk. However, it is important \nto consider that methodological limitations, \nespecially in terms of data and scenario \ndesign, could be underestimating the losses \nestimated by the financial system. In this \nsense, BBVA is working to reinforce and \nstrengthen bottom-up methodologies and \nanalytical capabilities in order to obtain \nprojections of customer financial statements \nand estimate impacts on collateral values \nbased on different climate scenarios and \nover different time horizons.\nAdditionally, the inclusion of impacts from \na physical risk event in the capital self-\nassessment exercise (ICAAP) is being \ndeveloped. Preliminary analyses of these \nevents also show immaterial impacts.\nFinally, the resilience of the strategy in \nthe face of different climate scenarios is \nreinforced by the fact that BBVA has set \nsustainability as one of its six strategic \npriorities, with a special focus on the fight \nagainst climate change, integrating its \ncommitment to align its financing portfolio \nwith scenarios compatible with the Paris \nAgreement: BBVA subsequently set \nintermediate 2030 goals for CO2 the oil & gas, \npower generation, autos, steel, cement \nsectors and the coal phase-out5 goal.\nOn the business side, the analysis is ongoing \nand the available results point to a resilient \nsituation, given the relatively low exposure \nto clients and sectors with higher climate-\nrelated risks. In fact, BBVA’s wholesale \nexposures related to emission-intensive and \ntransition risk-sensitive activities represent \napproximately 12.95% of total wholesale \nexposure, and 6.69% of the Group’s total \nexposure. Additional information on risk \nassessment and scenario analysis is \nincluded in the   Integrating climate change into  \n risk planning  section of this report. \n5.

In case of a discrepancy, the Spanish original will prevail.\nSECTION 02 / STRATEGY\nEngagement strategy \nwith customers, the \nindustry and the \npublic sector \n1. Customer engagement\nBBVA provides financial services to \ncorporate and institutional customers \nthrough its Corporate & Investment Banking \n(CIB) and Corporate and Business Banking \n(CBB) units, and to its retail and individual \ncustomers through its Retail Banking unit. \nThese clients include both large global \ncorporate and institutional clients, as well as \nsmaller clients with a more local presence \nor less sophisticated financial needs. BBVA \ncontinuously engages with its customers as \nindicated below. \n1.1. Due diligence process and \nknowledge of the customer\nFor wholesale clients, industry-specific \nsustainability questionnaires have \nbeen created with the aim of increasing \nmanagers’ and risk specialists’ knowledge \nof the environmental performance of large \ncorporate and institutional clients. This is \nlinked to the timing of the preparation or \nrenewal of the client’s financial program \nin order to make the best data-driven \ndecisions.\nBased on the information included in the \nKYC and provided by an external ESG expert \nadvisor, BBVA ensures that new wholesale \ncustomers covered by the Environmental \nand Social Framework do not incur any \nof the general exclusions or specific \nprohibitions for the mining, agribusiness, \nenergy, infrastructure and defense sectors. \nIf a potential customer is involved in any \ncontroversy or breach, a specific analysis \nof the situation will be carried out. A \nplan of dialogue and accompaniment of \nthe customer with measures aimed at \nunderstanding and trying to correct the \nsituation may then be undertaken. \nBBVA will not support the provision of \nfinancial services to wholesale customers \nincluded in\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GARANTI BBVA<|><organization<|>Garanti BBVA is a financial institution and a subsidiary of BBVA in Turkey, involved in banking services and part of sustainability indices)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BBVA<|><organization<|>BBVA is a multinational banking group that emphasizes sustainability, climate resilience, and responsible financial practices, with operations including its subsidiary Garanti BBVA in Turkey)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TURKEY<|><geo<|>Turkey is a country in which Garanti BBVA operates as a subsidiary, and it is involved in national financial and economic activities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BBVA GROUP<|><organization<|>BBVA Group is the parent banking organization that oversees BBVA and its subsidiaries, focusing on climate change strategies and sustainability reporting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUSTAINABILITY INDICES<|><event<|>Sustainability indices are benchmarks that evaluate companies' environmental, social, and governance performance, which Garanti BBVA is a member of)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REPORT ON CLIMATE CHANGE AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL ISSUES<|><event<|>A report section within BBVA's non-financial reporting that discusses climate change, environmental, and social issues affecting BBVA and its subsidiaries)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TCFD<|><event<|>Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, an organization providing recommendations for climate-related financial risk disclosures, which BBVA follows in its reporting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLIMATE RESILIENCE<|><event<|>The concept of developing adaptive capacity to respond to climate change, including managing transition and physical risks, which BBVA incorporates into its strategy)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARIS AGREEMENT<|><event<|>International treaty aiming to limit global warming, which BBVA aligns its financing portfolio with to combat climate change)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ECONOMIC SECTORS<|><organization<|>Various sectors such as oil & gas, power generation, autos, steel, cement, and coal, which BBVA has set CO2 reduction goals for by 2030 and 2040)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CUSTOMERS<|><person<|>Clients of BBVA, including corporate, institutional, retail, and individual customers, engaged in financial activities and sustainability practices)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KYC<|><event<|>Know Your Customer process used by BBVA to assess environmental and social risks associated with clients)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ESG EXPERT ADVISOR<|><organization<|>External organization providing environmental, social, and governance expertise to BBVA for due diligence and client assessment)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MINING, AGRIBUSINESS, ENERGY, INFRASTRUCTURE, DEFENSE<|><organization<|>Sectors involved in potential controversies or breaches that BBVA evaluates before providing financial services)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GARANTI BBVA<|>TURKEY<|>Garanti BBVA operates as a subsidiary of BBVA in Turkey<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BBVA<|>SUSTAINABILITY INDICES<|>BBVA is a member of main sustainability indices<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BBVA<|>REPORT ON CLIMATE CHANGE AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL ISSUES<|>BBVA publishes reports discussing climate and social issues<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BBVA<|>TCFD<|>BBVA follows TCFD recommendations for climate risk disclosures<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BBVA<|>PARIS AGREEMENT<|>BBVA aligns its climate strategies with the Paris Agreement<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BBVA<|>ECONOMIC SECTORS<|>BBVA has set CO2 reduction goals for specific sectors<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CUSTOMERS<|>BBVA<|>BBVA engages with its customers regarding sustainability and risk management<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KYC<|>ESG EXPERT ADVISOR<|>BBVA uses external ESG advisors for client due diligence<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MINING, AGRIBUSINESS, ENERGY, INFRASTRUCTURE, DEFENSE<|>BBVA assesses risks related to these sectors before providing services<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
