IPA website link https://ipa-news.de/index/sustainability/ \nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 202316\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION\nOur performance in 2022/23\nAs with businesses across the globe, adverse macro-economic trends are impacting our \nperformance. Underlying operating profit declined 21% mainly impacted by lower average \nPGM prices (c. £55 million impact*) and reduced refinery volumes. Cost inflation was more \nthan offset by efficiency benefits, as well as higher pricing across both our refining and \nproducts businesses. \nWe continued to invest in the long term future of our refineries, updating our assets so that \nwe are fully positioned to capture the opportunities in the coming decades. In China, we have \nexpanded our capabilities and now provide a full refinery offering, consolidating our position \nas a global leader in PGMs. \nGlobally we continue to make progress towards an integrated closed loop solution for CCM \nrecycling for Hydrogen Technologies. This will allow us to once again be a leading innovator \nin making circularity a reality in our markets, and in doing so, we will add to our value \nproposition to Hydrogen Technologies customers.\nThroughout 2022/23 we consulted with a range of government agencies around the world \non matters relating to critical material supply, circularity and the transition to net zero. Our \nexpertise is actively helping to drive forward the global green economy through contributing \nto policy development and technological progress.\nPositioning ourselves for long-term success\nIn the longer term, we see significant opportunities for PGMS. Platinum and iridium in \nparticular are growth areas given they are critical enablers of the hydrogen economy. We also \nsee new opportunities for palladium in industrial applications, including sustainable aviation \nfuels. We have world-leading expertise in securing a sustainable supply, through responsible \nsourcing and recycling. In addition, our ability to provide low carbon refined metals will \nbe increasingly important to our customers and society over time.\nPGMS is also a critical enabler for our other core businesses. We offer them an integrated \necosystem with expert knowledge of the PGM markets, responsible and sustainable metal \nsourcing, value added PGM catalysts and solutions for end-of-life recycling of their products. \nOur R&D priorities include a closed loop solution for CCMs used in fuel cells and electrolysers, \nrecovering the PGMs and ionomers, making it more sustainable and cost-effective for \nour customers.\n * £55 million adverse impact represents a gross PGM price impact before any foreign exchange movement\nSynergy in action\nWe’ve advised, supplied and facilitated recycling for big OEMs in the automotive industry for \nthe last 30-40 years, working closely with the Clean Air business. We have created a model \nthat enables us to work in partnership with our customers, offering a full range of services. \nThis is a blueprint that we will leverage as the CT and HT businesses continue to grow.\nEfficiency, performance and circularity \nin our products \nPGMs are essential to the processes and \ntechnologies that enhance our daily lives, \nbut it’s not always obvious where they’re \nused. One example is pharmaceutical \nmanufacturing. PGM catalysts and \nbiocatalysts are used across a vast range \nof drug synthesis processes to enable \ncomplex chemical structures to be formed. \nThey also help reduce the overall number \nof process steps in the synthesis, along \nwith waste. \nWe work with our pharmaceutical \ncustomers to develop tailored solutions \nand optimise catalyst performance for \na wide range of drug synthesis steps. \nThis includes reducing the metal loadings \nthrough catalyst thrifting. Using less metal \nnot only lowers costs, but can also reduce \nthe CO₂ footprint of production processes.\nOur unique end-to-end offering means \nthat while we source PGMs and use them \nto create products for specialist \napplications, we also maximise their value \nby recovering and refining them. For our \npharmaceutical customers, this happens \nin a closed loop, giving them a sustainable \nsupply of PGMs. \nIf you’ve bought or been prescribed \nmedication, you may well have benefitted \nfrom our expertise in PGMs and catalysis.\nWatch: a circular solution  \nfor a net zero future: matthey.com/circular-\nsolution-for-net-zero\nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 2023\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION 17\nPlatinum Group Metal Services continued\nCatalyst Technologies\nEnabling the chemicals and fuels \nindustries to operate efficiently and \ntransition to net zero \nOur Catalyst Technologies business focuses on  \nour core expertise in process technology\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>JOHNSON MATTHEY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Johnson Matthey is a global leader in sustainable technologies, specializing in the refining, recycling, and manufacturing of platinum group metals (PGMs) and related products, with a focus on circular economy solutions and enabling industries such as automotive, pharmaceuticals, and hydrogen technologies.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>PGM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Platinum Group Metals (PGMs) include platinum, palladium, rhodium, iridium, ruthenium, and osmium, which are critical for various industrial applications including catalysis, automotive emissions control, and hydrogen economy, and are sourced responsibly through recycling and responsible mining.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOHNSON MATTHEY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Johnson Matthey's performance in 2022/23 involved refining, recycling, and developing sustainable solutions for PGMs, with strategic investments in refining assets and expanding capabilities in China to support the global green economy.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINA<|>GEO<|>China is a key market where Johnson Matthey has expanded its refinery capabilities, consolidating its position as a global leader in PGMs and supporting the transition to sustainable technologies.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>HYDROGEN TECHNOLOGIES<|>EVENT<|>Hydrogen Technologies involve the use of PGMs such as platinum and iridium as critical enablers for fuel cells and electrolysers, contributing to the transition to a net-zero future.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUTOMOTIVE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The automotive industry uses PGMs in catalytic converters to reduce vehicle emissions, and Johnson Matthey has advised and supplied recycling services to major OEMs for 30-40 years.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>PHARMACEUTICAL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The pharmaceutical industry utilizes PGMs in catalysts and biocatalysts for drug synthesis, with Johnson Matthey developing tailored solutions to optimize catalyst performance and enable sustainable production.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>RECYCLING<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Recycling in Johnson Matthey involves recovering PGMs from end-of-life products, such as automotive and industrial spent catalysts, to support a circular economy and reduce environmental impact.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>CIRCULAR ECONOMY<|>EVENT<|>The circular economy is a key focus for Johnson Matthey, emphasizing recycling, responsible sourcing, and closed-loop solutions to minimize waste and environmental impact across industries.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>HYDROGEN<|>EVENT<|>Hydrogen is a critical element in Johnson Matthey's strategic focus, especially in enabling hydrogen economy applications through PGMs in fuel cells and electrolysers.)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOHNSON MATTHEY<|>PGM<|>Johnson Matthey specializes in refining and recycling PGMs, which are essential for their core applications in catalysis and green technologies<|>8)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOHNSON MATTHEY<|>CHINA<|>Johnson Matthey expanded its refinery capabilities in China to support global PGMs supply and technological innovation<|>6)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PGM<|>HYDROGEN TECHNOLOGIES<|>PGMs like platinum and iridium are enablers for hydrogen fuel cells and electrolysers, critical for the hydrogen economy<|>7)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOHNSON MATTHEY<|>RECYCLING<|>Johnson Matthey actively recovers PGMs from end-of-life products to support sustainability and circular economy initiatives<|>7)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOHNSON MATTHEY<|>AUTOMOTIVE<|>Johnson Matthey has a long-standing relationship with automotive OEMs, providing recycling and catalyst solutions for emission reduction<|>7)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOHNSON MATTHEY<|>PHARMACEUTICAL<|>Johnson Matthey develops catalysts for drug synthesis, contributing to sustainable pharmaceutical manufacturing<|>6)##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
