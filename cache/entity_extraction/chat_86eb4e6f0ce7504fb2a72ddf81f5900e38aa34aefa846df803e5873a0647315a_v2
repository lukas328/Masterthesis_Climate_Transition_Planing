We will continue to monitor and manage this through our enterprise-wide risk \nmanagement framework. This is consistent with the PRA’s aggregate findings from the CBES exercise, \npublished in July 2022, and justifies our continued focus on the measurement, management, and \nmonitoring of climate-related risks.\nA priority area of focus for NatWest Group in 2022 has been the continued enhancement of how we \nincorporate climate risk into our capital adequacy assessment process (ICAAP) and strategic planning \nprocess. This ensures that we have sufficient capital for the most material source of climate-related risk \nover the capital planning horizon. This analysis complements the longer-term analysis carried out for \nthe CBES and other internal scenario analysis, to give us a view on NatWest Group’s overall resilience \nto climate-related risks on a short (<5 years) and medium-to-long term (5-30 year) horizon. In 2022, \nwe also conducted scenario analysis on other principal risks including market risk, liquidity risk, conduct \nrisk and pension risk, which is outlined later in this section. NatWest Group continues to expand and \nenhance its use of climate risk scenario analysis and we recognise that this is a multi-year journey to \nfull maturity, with models and methodologies being refined as best practice evolves and data improves.\nIn this section we focus on the key developments and achievements in our scenario analysis capability \nbuild in 2022 and the key regulatory and internal use cases which drive our focus.\nNatWest Group recognises a number of key use cases for climate scenario analysis.\nThese include supporting strategic decision-making via our planning processes and supporting customer level \ndecisions via risk management across the customer lifecycle process. Scenario analysis use cases continue to \ndevelop across risk management practices through portfolio management and sector and subsector risk appetite, \nas well as identifying opportunities to support customers through products and pricing. Climate risk is also now an \nimportant part of the regulatory stress testing toolkit.\nNatWest Group is continuing to make progress in embedding climate risk analytics as \nappropriate across customer journeys and in supporting decision-making at customer and \nstrategic portfolio levels.\nIn response to internal use cases and 2022 regulatory feedback and guidance, NatWest Group has focused on \ndevelopment of scenarios, modelling infrastructure and data to meet our current and potential requirements for\n58NatWest Group plc | 2022 Climate-related Disclosures Report\nGovernance Strategy and Climate transition plan Risk Management and Scenario Analysis Metrics and TargetsIntroduction\nScenario Analysis continued\nInsights from climate risk scenario analysis that informed our work in 2022\nOur internal climate scenario analysis, carried out to support participation in the CBES exercise, considered \nprojected credit losses for three climate pathways over a 30-year time horizon (2021-2050) under a static balance \nsheet assumption. The scenarios, which are detailed in the table below, were all assessed against a hypothetical \ncounterfactual scenario, that assumes transition and physical risk remain constant at current levels. The \ncounterfactual is a hypothetical reference point to assess the increase in climate-related risk over the three main \nscenarios. This work was a critical step in understanding the potential impacts of climate change on NatWest \nGroup, assessing our resilience, and developing our climate scenario analysis and climate risk management \ncapabilities.\nIn light of the limitations included below, the initial results from our climate scenario analysis should \nmainly be used to understand the relative differences between scenarios, rather than the absolute \nlevel of modelled impairments. These results should not be interpreted as forecasts of expected \nlosses over the scenario period.\nUnder the three hypothetical scenarios, NatWest Group is most exposed under the Late Action scenario with \nless than £10 billion of potential cumulative losses above the counterfactual scenario to 2050. Approximately \ntwo thirds of these estimated losses could potentially crystalise between 2030 and 2035, the point at which \ndisruptive transition policy is implemented, resulting in a material increase in transition risk and an economic \nrecession. The majority of forecasted losses relate to corporate lending. A key conclusion for transition risk is \nthat supporting our customers transition to net zero is critical to managing our exposure to transition risk but \nachieving transition is subject to key dependencies as set out in section 3.4. \nThe impacts of physical risk were explored through the No Additional Action scenario, producing lower \ncumulative impairments such that the margin above the counterfactual scenario was about one quarter of \nthose seen in the Late Action scenario. This comparatively lower level of estimated impairments versus \ntransition risk scenarios is reflective of NatWest Group’s diversified lending profile across sectors, primarily \nlocated in the UK and hence expected to be less exposed relative to other regions, although note the \nlimitations highlighted below.\nThere are several key limitations which should be considered when looking at the results. These \nwere covered in detail in the 2021 Climate-related Disclosures Report and we are working to address \nthese key challenges.\nIn light of these limitations and building on the learnings and insights from this analysis, we have developed \nenhanced methodologies to incorporate climate-related risks into ECL and capital adequacy assessments - \nsee page 58.\nPhysical risk: We recognise that the No Additional Action scenario does not fully capture the severe \nlong-term impacts of irreversible climate change. Modelling the impact of physical risk poses material \nchallenges and limitations in comparison to transition risk. Particular challenges persist around data and \nlocation of customer assets, combined with the complexity of modelling physical risk perils and their \ninteraction with global and local supply chains. We continue to refine and enhance our physical risk modelling \ncapabilities, in particular focusing on ‘event based’ analysis to test resilience to severe weather events in the \nnear-term.
