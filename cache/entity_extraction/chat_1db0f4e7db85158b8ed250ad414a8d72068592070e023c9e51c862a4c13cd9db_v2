They worked in agile ways on sustainability \nchallenge areas with external start-ups, to build \ninnovative and scalable market propositions. We \nalso took the opportunity to work further with the \nprevious alumni of both programmes, engaging them \nas mentors for participants as well as tracking the \nimpact of their development. \nAcademies \nIn 2022, we launched two global academies. \nOur Digital Academy is designed to upskill our \ntechnology teams across the globe, as well as providing \nbasic digital and data literacy to people beyond the \ntechnology teams. \nWe also launched the Sustainability Academy that is \nsummarised in the Sustainability and ESG section. \nBoth academies run a schedule of events and \nlearning activities across the year. We also continued \nto invest in the development of our frontline and \ncustomer-facing teams with training that is locally \ndesigned and deployed. \nLeadership forums \nAnother way we connected with our leaders to \nreinforce delivery of our strategy is through two \nleadership communities. \nThe Strategic Development Forum is made up of our \nCEC as well as 60 senior leaders across Bupa. This \ngroup meets quarterly (once per year face-to-face) \nto discuss current progress against our strategy and to \nwork together on future priorities and focus areas. This \nforum creates a strong bond between leaders across \nthe globe and fosters the learning and sharing of best \npractice initiatives. \nThe Global Leadership Team is a broader leadership \nforum, hosting our top 700 leaders globally, again \nmeeting quarterly as a leadership exchange of \ninformation, including performance progress, \nexpectations of leaders and development focus \nareas for leaders. \nThese two forums are uniting our leadership \ncommunities, as a collective and in their messaging \nand approach to leadership. \nBupa Annual Report 2022 21 \n \n  \n    \n   \n             \n                  \n            \n                     \n               \n                \n               \n   \n               \n             \n  \n  \n        \n          \n         \n           \n       \n       \n      \n   \n       \n \n      \n     \n       \n        \n        \n \n        \n        \n            \n       \n    \n       \n         \n         \n       \n      \n       \n       \n      \n          \n     \n    \n       \n     \n        \n       \n         \n          \n         \n       \n  \n        \n   \n          \n  \n   \nStrategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements \nSustainability and ESG \nSustainability and Environmental, \nSocial and Governance (ESG) agenda \nOverview of sustainability strategy \nAt Bupa, sustainability starts with our purpose: 'Helping people live longer, healthier, happier lives \nand making a better world'. This commitment has been shaped by what we have learned as a global \nhealthcare company which has been looking after people’s health for 75 years. \nIt's become clear to us that, to look after people's health, we also need to look after the health of the \nplanet; and this reflects the World Health Organization’s description of climate change as the single \nbiggest health threat facing humanity. Put simply, climate change is a health crisis. As a healthcare \ncompany we have an important role to play in addressing the climate crisis, and a responsibility \nto act now. \nIn 2022, we launched our new sustainability strategy, which sets our ambition to play our part \nin tackling this challenge, and ‘making a better world’ for our colleagues, customers, communities \nand wider society. \nOur sustainability strategy \nOur sustainability strategy prioritises focus on the areas \nwhere we can drive the greatest impact for 'making a \nbetter world', the intersection of the health of humans \nand of the planet, because when we take care of the \nplanet, we are caring for people’s health too. \nComprised of three leading pillars, ‘Mission Zero’, \n‘Mission Accelerate’ and ‘Mission Regenerate’, we \ndo this by: \n1. Reducing the environmental impact of healthcare -\nMission Zero \n2. Accelerating innovative solutions to the biggest \nhealth-related sustainability challenges - Mission \nAccelerate \n3. Supporting action to protect, restore and regenerate \nlocal environments for the benefit of our customers \nour people, our communities and wider society -\nMission Regenerate. \nThe strategy has clear 2040 ambitions, but also nearer-\nterm goals as we know that transformational change \nis required in the next decade. In 2022, our focus was \non establishing our KPI measurement and reporting \napproach across all three pillars. \nAlthough our sustainability strategy sets the priorities \nwhere we can drive the greatest impact, we recognise \nthat broader ESG action is also needed. The three \nleading pillars are therefore underpinned by strong \nperformance across broader ESG topics including \ninclusion & diversity, social impact and responsible \nbusiness conduct. See more information about our \nsustainability strategy, and the materiality assessment \nthat informs it, on Bupa.com and the Task Force on \nClimate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) table \non page 101. \nIn 2022 we started our Sustainability Academy, \nbeginning with upskilling our leadership including \nthe Board and CEC, and priority functions on climate-\nrelated issues, to increase understanding of their \nimpacts to Bupa, and the impacts on the environment \nand society from Bupa, as well as how Bupa can play \nits part to drive transformative change in climate and \nhealth. The Academy curriculum will be developed \nfurther through 2023. \nSee Bupa.com here for more information on our \napproach to sustainability. \nBupa Annual Report 2022 22\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
