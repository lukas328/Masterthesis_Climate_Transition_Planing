Different processes, management policies and \ndirectives that cover the issue are supervised by a struc-\ntured system of governance, using guidelines that range \nfrom advisory committees to the Board of Directors and \nwhich are the direct responsibility of Vice-Presidencies \nand the directors of the Supply and Farming areas - with \nEESG programs and initiatives that also involve teams \nfrom areas such as Sustainability and Compliance.\nOur evolution in partner management involves the \nincorporation of socio-environmental premises and, in \n2022, 100% of our 696 new partners were selected based \non this criteria. We have a Chain Monitoring Program, \nwhich covers operations from the purchase of grains \nthrough freight and logistics services, involving quality \naudits, actions designed to disseminate the BRF Business \nPartners’ Code of Conduct, consultations of public data \nand contractual requirements. The requirements and \nprocesses are:\nCode of Conduct for BRF Business Partners: dissemi-\nnation of the document, which establishes the rules and \nethical and socio-environmental behavior expected of \nthose who work with us.\nPublic lists: once a fortnight, we cross-check the infor-\nmation contained in the public lists of entities such as the \nBrazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable \nNatural Resources (Ibama), the Ministry of Labor and \nEmployment (MTE), and the National Register of the \nDisreputable and Suspended Companies (Ceis), with the \naim of identifying suppliers which are not in compliance. \nShould irregularities be found, their registration is \nblocked for future business, until their situation has been \nregularized and they have been awarded a clearance \ncertificate.\nHuman rights and labor practices:: we have a HUMAN \nRIGHTS CORPORATE POLICY and we aim to curb any \noccurrence of labor in degrading or forced conditions, \nor conditions that are no compatible with human dignity, \nespecially child labor . \nAnimal welfare: this is an essential theme in our \nrelations, from integrated producers to our dialog with \ntransport service and logistics providers, involving all \nthose who have contact with live animals.\nSelf-assessment: all of our suppliers have to fill out a \n86\nValue Generation5\nOur way of \ndoing business\nOur strategy\nCulture and \nEngagement\nIndicators  \nand annex\n3\n4\n6\n2\nPresentation1\n2022 Integrated  \nReport\nchecklist/questionnaire addressing technical information.\nOne of our policies is to distribute our Business Partners’ \nCode of Conduct, Transparency Manual and Corporate \nPolicy on Human Rights amongst our suppliers and \npartners. As well as covering the guarantee of human \nrights, these regulatory documents contain specific guide-\nlines on our position in relation to child labor , forced labor \nor labor analogous to slavery - guidelines which must be \nrigorously complied with. \nWe closed the year with 100% of BRF’s volume of \npurchases made from suppliers who are in compliance \nwith the company’s norms and directives in relation to \nsocial, environmental and human rights aspects.\nOf the 35,225 partners assessed in social aspects, three \nwere identified as causing significant real or potential \nnegative social impacts, with whom we needed to \nestablish improvement plans. In relation to the socio-en-\nvironmental issue, we also assessed 35,225 suppliers. \nFifteen of them were identified as causing negative \nimpacts and, of these, we have outlined improvement \nplans for five partners. Also during the year , we ended \nrelations with 189 suppliers which presented real or \npotential negative environmental impacts, representing \n3.3% of the base. \nDevelopment of integrated producers\nIn 2022, we had approximately 9,500 integrated \nproducers working on animal farming. The controls and \ngovernance relating to the partners involve evaluations of \ncompliance analyzing whether they should be included in \nthe definition of a Politically Exposed Person and whether \nthere exist any conflicts of interest (corporate relationship \nor kinship with BRF employees and/or suppliers, for \nexample). We also apply actions to them in the sphere of \nthe Chain Monitoring Program, relating to sustainability, \ncompliance, legal compliance and human rights. \nIn the environmental sphere, we have an  area specifically \nworking on control and management in order to monitor \nsuppliers together with extension workers, these being \nemployees linked to livestock farming who\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SUPPLIERS<|><|>organization<|>Suppliers include centers, branch units, rural producers, farmers, cooperatives, traders, and retailers involved in supply chain activities, responsible for providing goods and services to the company)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BRF<|>organization<|>BRF is a company engaged in food production and supply chain management, focusing on sustainable practices, supplier management, and socio-environmental monitoring)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BRAZIL<|>geo<|>Brazil is the country where BRF's domestic suppliers are primarily located, representing 90.81% of the company's purchase volume)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Ibama<|>organization<|>Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources, responsible for environmental regulation and monitoring of suppliers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MTE<|>organization<|>Ministry of Labor and Employment in Brazil, overseeing labor practices and compliance among suppliers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Ceis<|>organization<|>National Register of the Disreputable and Suspended Companies, used to identify non-compliant suppliers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUSTAINABILITY<|>event<|>BRF's strategic focus on social, environmental, and economic sustainability in its supply chain management)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHAIN MONITORING PROGRAM<|>organization<|>BRF's program to oversee and ensure compliance, quality, and socio-environmental standards across its supply chain)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HUMAN RIGHTS CORPORATE POLICY<|>organization<|>BRF's policy aimed at preventing labor abuses, child labor, forced labor, and ensuring human dignity among suppliers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Animal Welfare<|>event<|>BRF's initiatives to promote humane treatment of animals throughout the supply chain, involving producers and logistics providers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOCIALLY IMPACTED PARTNERS<|>organization<|>Suppliers and partners identified as causing significant negative social or environmental impacts, requiring improvement plans)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Integrated Producers<|>organization<|>Approximately 9,500 producers involved in animal farming, monitored for compliance with sustainability, legal, and human rights standards)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Supply Chain<|>event<|>The entire process involving procurement, logistics, quality audits, and compliance activities managed by BRF)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRF<|>SUPPLIERS<|>BRF manages and oversees suppliers to ensure compliance with social, environmental, and human rights standards<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUPPLIERS<|>Ibama<|>Suppliers are cross-checked against Ibama's public lists to ensure environmental compliance<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUPPLIERS<|>MTE<|>Suppliers are monitored for labor law compliance through MTE's data<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUPPLIERS<|>Ceis<|>Suppliers are checked against the Ceis list to identify disreputable or suspended entities<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRF<|>SUSTAINABILITY<|>BRF's sustainability initiatives guide its supply chain management<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRF<|>CHAIN MONITORING PROGRAM<|>The program oversees supplier compliance and quality<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRF<|>HUMAN RIGHTS CORPORATE POLICY<|>BRF's policy ensures human rights are respected across its supply chain<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRF<|>Animal Welfare<|>BRF promotes humane treatment of animals in its supply chain<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRF<|>Integrated Producers<|>BRF works with approximately 9,500 producers to ensure compliance and sustainability<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
