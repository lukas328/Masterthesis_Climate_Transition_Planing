Is this something that can be scaled across multiple \nregions, or does it require a market and/or geographical-specific \napproach?\n> Just and inclusive transition: Ensuring that the principles of a just \nand inclusive transition are considered, with thought given to the \nsocial implications and any unintended consequences.  \n> Real-world impact: In exploring opportunities and evaluating \naction, we consider the real-world impact. We seek to contribute \nto tangible progress on decarbonisation, in a way that makes \nsense to the communities in which we operate, our customers, \nand our investors. \nEastspring invests in labelled bonds issued by companies, when \nsuitable investment opportunities are available. Labelled bonds \ninclude green bonds, and are considered by Eastspring only where the \ncompanies produce documentation that funding provided solely funds \nsustainable alternatives. These exist where investee companies issue a \ndebt instrument that finances decarbonisation targets, and is certified \nby a globally recognised standard. As of December 2022, Eastspring’s \nportfolio contained $1.5 billion in green bonds, a 25 per cent increase \nfrom FY21.  \nIn the future, Prudential may consider setting targets around the \nproportion of its assets to be classified as ESG- or SDG-promoted. \nThese targets would be set with full consideration of investment \nobjectives, risk tolerance and overall strategy. Further information \ncan be found in our 2022 ESG Report. \nObjective:  \nRisk/return and minimum \nthreshold on ESG\nPrudential has continued \nto integrate a minimum \nthreshold on ESG into its \ninvestment management \nagreements for mandates. \nEastspring classifies a range of strategies, developed in 2022, as \nESG promoted. These are funds managed against one or more \nESG KPIs, such as a lower carbon footprint, a lower exposure to \nfossil fuel reserves, and gender diversity indicators.\nIn 2022, Prudential introduced WACI budgets into certain \ncurrent funds or mandates, which allows these funds to be \nconsidered as ESG promoted. A phased approach for WACI \nbudgets into current funds and mandates was approved by the \nGroup ESG Committee during mid-2022, subject to appropriate \ninvestment governance. \nEastspring is currently \ndeveloping funds with \nthe objective of targeting \nalignment with the UN \nSDGs. These funds will \nlook at investing in listed \ncompanies that have \nevidence of addressing one \nor more UN SDGs through \ntheir products and services. \nObjective:  \nSpecific ESG objective  \nalongside risk/return\nObjective:  \nSDG alignment  \nalongside risk/return\nESG \nscreened\nESG \npromoted\nSDG \npromoted\nFigure 6: Framework to classify ESG investments \nImplementation and engagement strategy / continued\n  Policies and exclusions     \nOur coal policy is to divest from all direct investments in \nbusinesses that derive more than 30 per cent of their income \nfrom coal (whether mining or energy production). Our coal policy \nwas set to balance our stewardship duties in emerging markets, \nwhile also allowing companies in those markets to phase out coal \nin a just and inclusive manner, as discussed in our ‘Supporting a \nJust and Inclusive Transition’ white paper.

To understand our impact, we measure our \nenvironmental performance and take action to improve our \nperformance.  \nWe have set a target to become carbon neutral across our Scope 1 \nand 2 (market-based) emissions by the end of 2030. We aim to \ndeliver a 25 per cent reduction per full time employee (FTE) in our \noperational emissions from a 2016 baseline, and abate the \nremaining emissions via carbon offsetting initiatives. As of 2022, \nwe are ahead of the emissions reduction trajectory required to \nmeet our 2030 target. \nWe are continuing to explore the feasibility of setting operational \nnet-zero targets, which is currently difficult due to the lack of \nrenewable energy available within the markets that we operate. \nHowever, it may be possible in the future, through  mechanisms \nsuch as renewable energy certificates.   \nDuring 2021, we carried out a review of our Scope 3 emissions  in \naccordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and Partnership for \nCarbon Accounting Financials (PCAF). It considered all 15 Scope 3 \ncategories and provided us a better understanding of which areas of \nour value chain contribute most significantly to our overall emissions \nfootprint. For 2022, we focused on improving the data quality for the \ncategories we already report. Moving forward, we seek to keep this \nunder review and explore expansions of further Scope 3 categories, \nsuch as our extended supply chain. \n  Carbon offsets      \nAlthough we have an\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
