It is clear from 1.5°C climate scenarios that, in order to drive down \nemissions, we will need to electrify vast segments of our economy, such as transportation and the \nheating and cooling of our homes. Improving energy efficiency will also be essential. Electric vehicles \nwill need to be the dominant type of new vehicle sold by approximately 2030. By 2050, electricity \nwill need to be predominantly renewable, such as wind and solar , and nuclear power will also be \nimportant. And, finally, there will be a growing market and need for sustainable fuels, hydrogen and \ncarbon capture, utilization and sequestration (CCUS). Transition of the energy sector is not just about \nreducing emissions, but meeting energy demands of today and tomorrow. \nThe Effect of the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act on Citi’s Finance Activities\nIn August 2022, the U.S. enacted the Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”), which allocates $369 billion to \nspur investment in businesses and technologies that will facilitate and accelerate decarbonization. \nIn addition to extending tax credits for renewable energy development, this major piece of climate \nlegislation introduces new tax credits and incentives to support: energy storage; electrification of \ntransportation; building electrification and energy efficiency; domestically produced renewables \nequipment; low-carbon hydrogen; carbon capture utilization and storage; methane emissions \nreduction; bio-fuels; and nuclear power . This Act represents unequivocal prioritization and \nincreased momentum for emissions mitigation and reduction technologies. Citi is closely following \nthe implementation of the IRA and recognizes it could allow more clients to access tax incentives \nthan have historically been able to do so. We are evaluating financing opportunities as guidance \nbecomes available with the objective of assisting our clients and accelerating the transition to a \nlow-carbon economy.\nTCFD REPORT 2022: CITI’S APPROACH TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND NET ZERO | 29\nExamples of Client Engagements in 2022\nesVolta\nGenerate Capital, PBC (“Generate”), a leading sustainable infrastructure company that owns and \noperates more than 2,000 assets globally, announced its acquisition of esVolta, a leading developer , \nowner and operator of utility-scale battery storage projects around North America. Citi served as \nsole financial advisor to esVolta and ran a competitive sales process for them in a record acquisition \nyear for battery storage companies. esVolta’s portfolio includes over 1 GWh of operational and utility-\ncontracted projects in the U.S. and Canada and has additional energy storage projects including \nacross Arizona, California, Colorado, Montana, New Mexico, Texas and Washington in its development \nhorizon. By adding a growing team of experts with a pipeline of attractive projects, this acquisition \nenables Generate to expand into the market of large-scale battery storage projects that support the \npower grid.\nGIC Private Ltd.\nIn April 2022, GIC Private Ltd. (“GIC”) agreed to invest and co-lead the private capital raise for \nClimeworks AG, one of the most advanced and pioneering industry players in direct air capture \n(“DAC”) technology. GIC is a leading global investment firm established in 1981 to secure Singapore’s \nfinancial future and serves as the manager of Singapore’s foreign reserves. Climeworks builds \nand operates DAC facilities, which capture CO2 directly from the air and store it permanently \nunderground. Climeworks operates the world’s first and only commercial-scale DAC plant, in \nIceland. With total proceeds of CHF 600 million ($650 million USD) raised, the investment supports \nClimeworks with the capital to unlock the next phase of its growth, scaling direct air capture up to \nmulti-million-ton capacity and implementing large-scale facilities. Citi served as the sole financial \nadvisor to GIC on this capital raise.\n30 | TCFD REPORT 2022: CITI’S APPROACH TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND NET ZERO\nEngagement  \nWe work with new and existing clients across varying stages of transformation in their strategies and goals \nas they navigate the transition to a low-carbon economy. When we issued our 2021 TCFD Report, which \nincluded our initial net zero targets, we spent significant time explaining our methodology to clients and \nhow we intend to engage with them. Many of our clients are still in the initial phases of establishing and \nmeeting their decarbonization goals, although we continue to be impressed with many of their unique and \ncreative decarbonization strategies that are optimized for their distinct business models. \nOne of our ongoing engagement priorities is to identify clients with high emissions footprints and engage \nin discussions on climate strategy, such as emissions reductions plans. To aid our engagement efforts, we \nhave developed a Net Zero Review Template to pull together information on our clients’ profiles (see below).  \nOur conversations related to the Template, are only the jumping-off point for further engagement, strategic \ndialogue and the delivery of Citi’s capabilities to help empower clients in achieving their goals. \nCiti is also engaging with those clients who are not yet disclosing their own emissions and encouraging \nthem to start doing so. Disclosure of emissions will be needed to understand our clients’ current emissions \nprofiles and transition opportunities and to inform future business decisions\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CITI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Citi is a global financial services company actively involved in financing and advising on climate change mitigation, renewable energy projects, and low-carbon transition strategies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TCFD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) is an organization that develops voluntary, consistent climate-related financial risk disclosures for companies to provide transparency to investors and stakeholders)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Generate Capital<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Generate Capital is a leading sustainable infrastructure company owning and operating over 2,000 assets globally, specializing in renewable energy and energy storage projects)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>esVolta<|>ORGANIZATION<|>esVolta is a developer, owner, and operator of utility-scale battery storage projects across North America, acquired by Generate Capital in 2022)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GIC Private Ltd.<|>ORGANIZATION<|>GIC Private Ltd. is Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund established in 1981, investing globally to secure Singapore’s financial future, including investments in climate-related technologies like direct air capture)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Climeworks<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Climeworks is a pioneering company in direct air capture (DAC) technology, operating the world’s first commercial-scale DAC plant in Iceland to capture and store CO2 underground)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>U.S. Inflation Reduction Act<|>EVENT<|>The Inflation Reduction Act enacted in August 2022 is a major legislative measure in the U.S. that allocates $369 billion to promote decarbonization, renewable energy, energy efficiency, and low-carbon technologies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>2030<|>EVENT<|>The year 2030 is identified as a target for electric vehicles to become the dominant new vehicle type, and for electricity to be predominantly renewable, marking key milestones in climate and energy transition)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>2050<|>EVENT<|>The year 2050 is projected as a milestone when electricity generation will need to be mainly from renewable sources like wind, solar, and nuclear power)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CITI<|>TCFD<|>Citi follows the recommendations of the TCFD for climate-related disclosures and engagement<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Generate Capital<|>esVolta<|>Generate Capital acquired esVolta, a developer and operator of utility-scale battery storage projects<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GIC Private Ltd.<|>Climeworks<|>GIC invested in Climeworks to support direct air capture technology<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>U.S. Inflation Reduction Act<|>CITI<|>Citi is monitoring and evaluating financing opportunities arising from the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>2030<|>Electric Vehicles<|>Electric vehicles are expected to be the dominant new vehicle type by 2030<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>2050<|>Renewable Energy<|>By 2050, electricity generation will be mainly from renewable sources like wind, solar, and nuclear<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
