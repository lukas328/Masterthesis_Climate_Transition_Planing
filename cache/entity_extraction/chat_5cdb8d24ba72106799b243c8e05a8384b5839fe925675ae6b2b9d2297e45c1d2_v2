It considered all 15 Scope 3 \ncategories and provided us a better understanding of which areas of \nour value chain contribute most significantly to our overall emissions \nfootprint. For 2022, we focused on improving the data quality for the \ncategories we already report. Moving forward, we seek to keep this \nunder review and explore expansions of further Scope 3 categories, \nsuch as our extended supply chain. \n  Carbon offsets      \nAlthough we have an operational carbon neutral target, it is \nour strategy to decarbonise where possible before purchasing \noffsets. Importantly, offsets do not form a part of our core \ndecarbonisation strategy. As the fall in our 2022 emissions \ncontinues to be ahead of the reduction trajectory required to \nmeet our 2030 target for Scope 1 and 2 emissions, we have \nnot purchased any carbon offsets for Scope 1 and 2 emissions \nin 2022. We continue to keep our policy around the use of \noffsets under review and revisit the purchase of offsets on \nan annual basis. \n16\nPrudential plc Climate Transition Plan prudentialplc.com\nPrudential’s relevant climate-related metrics can be found in the table below.

It \nrecognises the major role that Prudential can continue to play across \nAsia and Africa, as well as in the long-term success, resilience and \nhealth of the communities in which we operate. As such, ESG matters, \nincluding climate change, are overseen by the Board, which is \nresponsible for determining overall strategy and prioritisation of \nkey focus areas, and monitoring risk. More information on the \ncomposition and competencies of our Board can be found in the \nGovernance section of our 2022 Annual Report.\nThe Board Responsibility and Sustainability Working Group (RSWG), \nestablished in January 2021, continued during 2022. In July 2022, \nthe responsibilities of the RSWG were re-positioned to focus on \ncustomer, culture and digital, in addition to people and community \nmatters. Oversight responsibilities for environmental and climate-\nrelated issues, and the ongoing implementation of the Group’s \nexternal commitments to the decarbonisation of its operations \nand investment portfolio and other climate-focused external \nresponsible investment commitments were transferred to the Group \nRisk Committee (GRC). Their terms of reference were amended to \nensure a holistic approach to these climate-related topics. The GRC’s \nadditional responsibilities extend to external reporting, via the ESG \nReport, where it relates to those areas within its remit, including \nmonitoring the progress of the Group’s reporting against the \nrecommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-Related Financial \nDisclosures (TCFD).  \nFollowing this transition, an exercise was completed to map \nthe material climate and climate-commitment-related activities \nwhich support the GRC’s new responsibilities, and the supporting \ngovernance arrangements. The supporting management \ninformation and frequency has also been reviewed. \nIn addition to regular course discussion, to further enhance strategic \nBoard-level discussions on climate, a dedicated climate deep-dive \nsession was also held with the Board in September 2022. Following \ndiscussions at the Board on our approach to climate change, the \nprogress towards the Group’s externally communicated climate-\nrelated commitments, climate-related opportunities and the evolving \nexpectations of stakeholders, the Board agreed on the need for clear \ncommunication around Prudential\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
