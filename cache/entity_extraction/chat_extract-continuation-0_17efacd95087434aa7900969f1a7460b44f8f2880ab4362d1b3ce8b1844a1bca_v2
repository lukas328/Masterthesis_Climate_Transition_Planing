(TRIR) to 1� 5 by 2025, and to 0�6  \nby 2030� \nTRIR includes ‘restricted work injuries’ and ‘medical treatment \ninjuries’ in addition to Lost Time Injuries (LTI's) � The TRIR therefore \nprovides greater insight to help inform our activities and initiatives � \nOur focus on TRIR also indicates the maturity of our safety journey, \nunderscoring the fact that we have reduced our Lost Time Injury \nRate (LTIR) by 25 percent over the last five years � \nThe scope of our TRIR reporting has included Vestas employees and \nsupervised contractors � Going forward from 12 January 2023, we \nwill include all contractors under our operational control � The \nconsequence will be our baseline will rise; however, we are still \ncommitted to reducing our TRIR by 2025 (please see page 58 for \nmore information on contractor safety) �\nPredicting, preventing, \nand managing health \nand safety risks\n44\nVestas Sustainability Report 2022\nSocialIn brief General GovernanceEnvironment

2027 2028 2029 2030\nTo reach our ambitious target, in the second half of 2022 we have \ninitiated a new HSE management system, which is simpler, clearer, \nand more systematic � The system takes a risk-based approach, in \nline with the new ISO 45001 standards � It will form the backbone of \nour approach to addressing HSE risks, and is fundamental to \neffective HSE management, which must be integrated into the \noperational process and considered in all future development \nprojects � It will be mandatory for all regions and functions to comply \nwith this systematic approach, which sets the minimum bar for how \nwe manage our risks in our operations � With this in place, we will be \nable to address operational control through critical control checks, \nand an assurance methodology including the training of certified \nauditors �\nIn 2023, we will also focus on HSE leadership and awareness, \nincluding personal safety action plans, global campaigns and \nenhanced training products � These programmes will establish a \nsystematic approach to driving our vision and ambition to establish \na culture where safety is second nature � The bottom line is that \nsafety needs to be a natural part of our working culture � To drive the \nawareness, we have started developing dashboards providing \nintelligence on HSE performance down to the individual site for \nmanagers throughout the organisational levels � \nOur safety performance in 2022\nOur TRIR increased to 3 �3, from 3�1 in 2021� While we have \nmanaged to reduce our TRIR by 69 percent since 2012, we remain \ncommitted to maintaining progress and meeting our 2025 and \n2030 targets � \nDuring the year, our LTIR per million working hours increased to 1� 2� \nWe continued to focus on incidents with high actual severity or high \npotential severity � We will now ensure that we learn from these \nincidents and share the lessons across the organisation to prevent \nre-occurrence � Zero employee fatalities occurred in 2022 � \nSafety awareness \nWidespread awareness is integral to the management and preven -\ntion of safety hazards � Since 2007 , we have run a safety awareness \nprogramme for employees and managers � Furthermore, safety \ntraining is a mandatory part of the onboarding process for all \nemployees � The ultimate objective of this programme is to eliminate \nall Lost Time Injuries � To further strengthen our safety culture and \nencourage good safety behaviours, 22,497 of our employees \nparticipated in safety awareness training during 2022 � \nAs well as participating in the safety awareness programme, senior \nmanagement demonstrated top level commitment to safety this \nyear by participating in ‘safety walks’ � A safety walk is an opportunity \nfor managers to engage in constructive dialogue and discuss safe \nbehaviour with employees, helping to find new ways of improving \nsafety within specific job environments � \nFocusing on behaviour \nWe have identified behaviour, specifically a lack of focus and \nawareness, as primary causes of workplace incidents and injuries � \nOur My Team My Responsibility (MTMR) programme builds on a \nstrong foundation of employee engagement with safety issues � \nFrontline managers and supervisors work with their teams to \nidentify the behaviours they want to improve together, then take \nownership as a team to drive change and improvement � \nThe Vestas Behavioural Change (VBC) programme is an employ -\nee-led safety observation initiative � It actively encourages employ -\nees to observe and assess each other’s behaviour while carrying out \nspecific work-related tasks, with recognition and reward for good \nsafety behaviour � Equally, any risky behaviours identified during the \nobservation are stopped, adjusted, and reassessed to ensure risk is \nmitigated � The programme also encourages open, honest, and \nconstructive safety dialogue between colleagues � It emphasises the \ncollective
