Overall, we have set transition plans for 72% of our lending book as at December 2019. To develop \ntransition plans for financing activity, we considered the following:\nBusiness operations, products and services\n • Supporting our customers’ transition is a key driver in the development and delivery of our transition plans. \nWe have worked with the business teams within each sector to identify products, services and business \noperation changes that can be made available to support customer transition.\n • Where possible, we have performed this analysis at a subsector level to ensure actions most relevant to \ncustomers within these segments are identified and recorded within the transition plan.\nFinancial planning\n • We have started to align the initial iteration of our Climate transition plan with our financial plan. \nThis helps ensure that climate strategy and its execution are built into the financial plan, including regular \nmonitoring and review.\n • We will continue to develop this alignment during 2023 as part of the evolution of our Climate transition plan.\nSensitivity analysis including dependence on government policies\n • NatWest Group’s initial climate transition plan has been developed with reference to the UK’s statutory \ncommitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions to net zero target by 2050.\n • NatWest Group and our customers are dependent on the UK Government to deliver credible, consistent and \nsecure policies capable of delivering the UK’s 2050 net zero target. The UK CCC’s 2022 Progress Report \nhighlights the UK’s own commitment to deliver a 78% reduction in emissions by 2035, based on 1990 levels.\n • To assess climate impacts of policies within the initial iteration of our transition plans, we have used the UK \nCCC Beyond Net Zero (BNZ) scenario, aligned with the UK’s sixth carbon budget, as a starting point. In \naddition, we have used the credibility ratings for sectoral policies provided by the UK CCC 2022 Progress \nReport to the Parliament (UK CCC 2022 Progress Report) to develop a BNZ adjusted pathway to reflect \nestimated time delays based on credibility ratings as follows\n • Credible Policies: estimated 0 years of delayed adjustment to the BNZ pathway for the associated policy \ne.g. policies for zero emissions vehicles mandate and renewable electricity supply.\n • Policies with some or significant risk: estimated 3 and 5 years of delay respectively for the associated \npolicy\n • Policies with insufficient plans: estimated 10 years of delay for the associated policy.\n • In cases where the UK CCC 2022 Progress Report has provided commentary on policies without providing a \ncredibility rating, we have not adjusted the BNZ pathway for our analysis.\nSections 3, 5.4 and 5.5 include details of the initial iteration of our Climate transition plan. While we have developed \nthese plans on a sector basis, these are presented aggregated as systems to demonstrate the inter-linkages \nbetween sectors. Refer to section 3.4 for further details of our systems thinking approach. Refer to section 5.5 for \nfurther details on sector level estimates of financed absolute emissions and emissions intensities including progress \nmade against pathways for each sector.\nRelevant limitations associated with the initial iteration of our Climate transition plan and associated metrics are \nincluded in sections 5.4, 5.5, 5.7 and the “Risk Factors” included within the NatWest Group plc Annual Report and \nAccounts. Transition-related Risks are outlined in section 4.2 of this report.\nThe initial iteration of our Climate transition plan has confirmed that further action is required by NatWest Group \nand its customers to meet our ambition and decarbonisation plans. It is also clear that support from timely and \nappropriate government policies will be required to create incentives for transition and customer behaviour \nchanges. This is aligned with the Mission Zero: Independent Review of Net Zero Report published by Rt Hon Chris \nSkidmore MP in January 2023:\n‘Evidence provided to the review has shown that the Net \nZero Strategy and other recent government publications \nhave not provided adequate certainty to business and \ninvestors. Clearer plans, focused on individual sectors, set \nout over the long-term, and communicated clearly to the \npublic, are important to ensure buy-in and providing a stable \ninvestment environment.’\nMission Zero: Independent Review of Net Zero Report, January 2023\nThe initial iteration of our Climate transition plan has been informed by the Transition Planning Taskforce (TPT) \nsummary recommendations.
