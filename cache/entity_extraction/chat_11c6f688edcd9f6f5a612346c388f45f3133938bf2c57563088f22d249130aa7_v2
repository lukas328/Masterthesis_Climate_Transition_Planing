The Committee discussed \nwith management how the legal, regulatory and ethical \nissues associated with each of these risks would be \naddressed. The Committee has monitored the potential \nrisks to the business from rising inflation and has \nconsidered the actions management are taking \nto mitigate its impact. \nConsideration of other emerging risks has focused \non those that would be a threat to, or would indicate \na weakness in, our business model. Emerging risks \nhave been taken into account by management \nwhen developing the Group’s strategic objectives, \nincluding through identifying mitigating actions, \nand also to enable the Group to take advantage \nof the opportunities these risks may also present. \nThey cover themes including: \n▪ Increasing customer, staff and societal expectations \n▪ Advances in technology \n▪ Increasing standards of regulation \n▪ Geopolitical uncertainty and deglobalisation \n▪ Rapidly advancing medical treatments and \ntechnologies, including personalised therapies \n▪ Climate change. \nWhile the emerging risks we considered apply to our \ninsurance, provision and aged care businesses, they \ncould manifest in a different way in each business, \nrequiring a different response.

The conclusions of this assessment are set out \nin the Audit Committee report on page 67. \nIn early 2023, I asked members of the Committee for \ntheir views on whether any Group-wide adjustments \nshould be made to discretionary remuneration in \nrespect of risk matters arising during 2022. I then \nattended a meeting of the Remuneration Committee \nto give the Committee’s view, to aid the Remuneration \nCommittee’s decision on whether any risk-related \nadjustments should be applied to the financial \nperformance data used in connection with the \ncalculation of the bonuses potentially payable \nunder the incentive schemes within the Remuneration \nCommittee’s remit. No Group-wide adjustments \nwere recommended, although I indicated that the \nCommittee would be monitoring the risk environment \nin Australia closely going forward. \nOther \nIn addition, the Committee has carried out other \nbusiness as required under its Terms of Reference \nincluding: reviewing and recommending the Group’s \nannual Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) \nto the Board for approval, including the results of \na worldwide stress and scenario test based on an \ninflation-driven economic scenario; reviewing the \nGroup’s insurance coverage; considering risk \nassessments in contemplation of commencing business \nin new territories for the Group; and reviewing the \nmodelling of economic capital as part of the Group’s \nannual ORSA process. A number of risk appetite \nstatements have been reviewed to ensure that they \nremain appropriate in the current environment and \nthe Group-wide Enterprise Risk Policies are reviewed \non a cyclical basis at least every two years by the \nappropriate Board committee. \nSubsidiary governance \nThe chairs of each of Bupa’s major insurance subsidiary \nboard risk committees are invited to attend a meeting \nof the Committee each year and to provide written \nupdates periodically. This provides valuable insights \nboth to the Committee and to the subsidiary board risk \ncommittee chairs on the issues that are material in each \ncontext and facilitates Group oversight of local risks \nand appropriate escalation of risks to the Committee. \nI also attend a meeting of each of the major insurance \nsubsidiary board risk committees each year and meet \nwith the relevant chief risk officer. The minutes of the \nmeetings of the major insurance subsidiary board risk \ncommittees are also made available to the Committee. \nCommittee effectiveness review \nDr Tracy Long, of Boardroom Review, observed a \nmeeting of the Committee in late 2022 and discussed \nthe\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
