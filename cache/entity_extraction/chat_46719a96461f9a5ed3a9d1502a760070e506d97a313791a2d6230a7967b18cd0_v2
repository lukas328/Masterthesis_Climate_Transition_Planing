By doing so, the Company can plan and \noutline more robust and assertive strategies, always with \na focus on the result and the generation of value for the \nclients, customers, shareholders and the entire produc-\ntion chain. The actions, that range from the field to the \ntable, include the digitization of the agricultural operation \nand incremental improvements at the industrial plants in \nthe different markets.\nOur innovative solutions include the use of advanced \nstatistics and technologies such as cognitive intelligence \n(chatbots), the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning \nand advanced analytics. One example of an initiative of \nthis type is the use of predictive models and machine \nlearning algorithms to predict the average price of chick-\nen slaughter . Through this innovation, BRF can plan and \nachieve the best cost-benefits between the time spent \nrearing the animals and the right moment for their \nslaughter (taking into consideration the different variables \nthat can influence this process, such as the availability and \nquality of feed, climate, and housing and sanitary condi-\ntions), thus achieving an important competitive advan-\ntage.\nBRF was recognized in the ‘100+ Innovators in the Use \nof Technology’ category awarded by IT Mídia in 2022 for \nits 'Data Driven from Field to Table’ project. The initiative \nforms part of the Company's digital transformation jour-\nney and can be added to the 52 initiatives implemented \nduring the year to provide greater agility and assertive-\nness in decision-making, with benefits for the chain as a \nwhole. \nAs well as promoting a culture guided by data, the Com-\npany has invested in ongoing learning and a culture of \ninnovation, making a new BRF Academy available - this \nbeing a learning platform that can be accessed by all our \nemployees. In 2022, we reached more than 7,600 employ-\nees by means of the online ‘LearningFlix’ channel provided \nthrough the BRF Academy and dedicated to the dissem-\nination of a streamlined culture, innovation and digital \ntransformation.\n‘Go digital’ and ‘Be digital’: our agenda\nDigital Transformation at BRF is taking place on two major \nfronts: Go Digital, where we are working on improving \nour results through the modernization and digitalization \nof the processes related to our business and to our stake-\nholders, and Be Digital, in which we are taking a close \nlook at our internal processes, with tools and platforms \nthat provide greater efficiency and facilitate the employ-\nment journey of the Company’s almost 100 thousand \nemployees. \nAmongst the internal processes that have already been \nconsidered for digitization actions are employee attraction \nand selection, digital admission, the self-service portal, the \nlearning platform, management of results, and develop-\nment, performance, succession and remuneration cycles, \nCurrently, all admissions at BRF in Brazil are performed \nonline, which simplifies and streamlines the process, as \nwell as improving the transparency of the new employee’s \nonboarding process. More than 30,000 employees have \njoined the company through this new process. \nAnother advance in the Employee’s Journey has been \n‘Flor’, the virtual assistant in the Human Resources depart-\nment.
