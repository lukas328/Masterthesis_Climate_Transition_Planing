We focus \non local, business and executive managers’ engagement levels in implementing corrective \nactions and in strengthening the control framework across all our sites. The focus of \nassurance activities during the year has been on post Covid-19 controls’ culture across the \ngroup’s locations and key strategic and emerging risks. Establishing site extended audits \nre-evaluated and re-assessed how our businesses adjusted to the new realities and how the \ncontrol mindset has been applied across a selection of our sites. It was expected that in this \nchanged landscape, the audits would uncover some weaknesses; however they have also \nallowed us to see how the businesses have managed the challenges caused by the \nextraordinary measures implemented during that period. One issue highlighted was the need \nfor further training and awareness around certain controls, systems and simplification of \nprocesses. The comprehensive improvement programme across our financial and operational \ncontrols, sponsored by the CFO, has been established to raise awareness and simplify the \nrequirements. The GAR team has also undertaken various ‘lessons learnt’ activities, including \nfor major business decisions and capital investment projects. The recommendations have \nbeen captured and are being implemented by the business and transformation office. \nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 2023100\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION\nAudit Committee Report continued\nWe continually review the effectiveness of the GAR function, using inputs including audit \nreports, management’s response to audit actions and discussions over risk exposures. We look \nat whether the function has adequate standing across the group, is free from management \ninfluence or other restrictions and is sufficiently resourced.\nAn independent external quality assessment (EQA) of the Internal Audit function within \nGAR was undertaken by EY last year. As a result, the function has worked through the actions \nagreed to ensure it has become better aligned with the changing shape of the group. This is \na continuous activity for the function, underpinned by regular dialogue with management, \nexternal auditors, and benchmarking within industry and beyond.\nThe integrated assurance mapping allows us to have a fuller understanding and visibility \nof risk coverage in a consistent manner across the organisation. We aim to have a clearly \narticulated link between levels of assurance and risk appetite across key organisational \nand strategic risks.\nGroup assurance and risk annual plan\nWe review the GAR annual plan to ensure that it reflects challenges and changes to our \nbusiness. We are confident that it provides the appropriate level of assurance over the group’s \nkey risks.\nWhen we reviewed the 2023/24 plan, we specifically considered whether it provided the level \nof assurance over JM’s principal and operational risks and continues to contribute to the \nimprovement in our overall controls culture and maturity of the second line of defence. \nThe GAR annual plan is based on a risk-based audit universe covering areas of risk across \nfinancial and operational functions including IT and transformation activities at group and \nbusiness levels. We consider a wide range of risks that fall into those areas including level of \nchange and transformation in the group and organisational culture. Close collaboration with \nthe business ensures it adds value to management with pragmatic and manageable action \nplans. The plan also allows greater flexibility to ensure that the GAR team has capacity to deal \nwith unexpected events.\nWe believe our 2023/24 assurance plans are adequate for JM’s size and nature. It is our \nopinion they will continue to provide the group with necessary focus on maturing controls \nculture across business and IT processes. The quality and standing of GAR function is \nappropriate to provide necessary challenge and support to the transforming organisation.\nRisk management\nWe work with the Board to review and refine the risk assurance processes – including the \nintegrated assurance framework and control self-assessment. We concentrate on reviewing \nthe mitigating controls and the levels of assurance, while the Board is directly responsible \nfor managing risks and establishing levels of risk appetite for the group’s principal risks.\nThe GAR function carries out any additional assurance and reports back to the Committee.\nSpeak Up process\nEvery year, we review our Speak Up whistleblowing process to ensure procedures are \nproportionate and independent. We reviewed the process and agreed that the procedures \nallow proportionate and independent investigation and appropriate effective follow-up \naction. We report the findings of this review to the Board as appropriate. The Societal Value \nCommittee reviews the outcomes of significant investigations and remedial actions.\n More information on Speak Up can be found on page 42\nExternal auditor\nAuditor independence is an essential part of our audit framework and the assurance it provides.  \nWe confirm ongoing compliance with the Competition and Markets Authority’s Statutory \nAudit Services Order. \nTenure\nOur shareholders appointed PwC as the group’s external auditor in July 2018, following a formal \ntender process. This is the fifth year that PwC has audited the group, with Graham Parsons \nas current lead audit partner. We have no immediate plans to retender the auditor; however \nwe anticipate that it would be carried out to coincide with when Graham Parsons is required \nto rotate off after the 2027 audit, in accordance with the current regulation that requires \na tender every ten years. The proposed tender date is in the best interests of shareholders \nand the Company as PwC has a detailed knowledge of our business, an understanding of our \nindustry, and continues to demonstrate that it has the necessary expertise and capability to \nundertake the audit.\nExternal audit plan\nIn developing the external audit plan for 2023, PwC carried out a risk assessment to identify \npotential risks of material misstatement in the financial statements.
