We \nalso opened a new laboratory and are building a new hospital in Madrid, \nwhich we expect to open in 2025. \nIn Sanitas Mayores, our aged care business in Spain, underlying profit \nincreased due to improved occupancy as we continued to emerge from \nthe pandemic (closing occupancy was 93%, up 6 ppts). In addition, a \nnew version of our BluaU app to support access to home care services, \nwas launched. \nIn Chile, while there was some revenue increase in our Isapre insurance \nbusiness due to permitted price increases from 2021, losses increased as a \nresult of the judicial and regulatory action affecting the industry, which has \nhad a significant negative impact on pricing. The Isapre industry challenges \nare summarised in the Note on Chile on page 11. In health provision, revenue \nimproved due to higher volumes and prices and increased activity in our \nSantiago hospital, however underlying profit was impacted by inflation. \nWe also opened a new medical centre in Santiago. \nIn Poland, LUX MED delivered robust revenue and underlying profit growth \nmainly from new corporate subscriptions. Insurance revenue was ahead \nof prior year, but profit remained broadly flat due to higher claims. A new \nhealth insurance product with inpatient coverage was launched to around \n20,000 new net members. \nIn Bupa Acıbadem Sigorta, our health insurance business in Türkiye, revenue \nincreased due to both corporate and individual customer growth and \npricing actions to counter high inflationary pressure. Underlying losses \nworsened from higher claims linked to increasing medical inflation. \nCare Plus in Brazil delivered strong revenue and customer growth, \nhowever, underlying profit decreased as a result of higher claims \nvolumes and inflation. \nBupa Mexico delivered good revenue growth through increased customer \nnumbers and new products. Underlying profit, however, declined due to \nhigher volumes of claims and inflation. We signed a ten year coinsurance \nand reinsurance deal with, our partner, HDI, which will provide access to \nover 7,000 agents to distribute products. We also acquired a new hospital \nin Mexico City. \nBupa Global Latin America generated an underlying profit by maintaining \nhigh customer retention alongside premium increases to offset higher \nclaims inflation. \n1.

Excluding £117m of impairments to right \nof use leases and fixed assets in our dental business, underlying \nprofit increased driven by higher volumes in UK Insurance \nand improved performance in Bupa Global, our international \nhealth insurance business. Revenue growth in health provision \nand aged care was offset by heightened costs in an \ninflationary environment. \nUK Insurance increased revenue and underlying profit through strong \ngrowth in customer volumes and premium increases required to offset \ninflationary pressures on claims and staff costs. We grew by over 275,000 \nnet customers across medical insurance, health trusts, dental and cash plan, \npassing the milestone of three million lives covered. We continue to expand \ndigital services with the launch of Blua, our new digital healthcare platform, \nwhich provides customers with easy 24/7 access to primary care services. \nWe launched new propositions, including ‘Inclusive Health’ for corporate \ncustomers, covering women’s health, sexual health and neurodiversity. For \nour insurance customers, we launched a new specialist centre for prostate \ncancer within our Cromwell Hospital and increased the number of specialist \ncentres for breast and bowel cancers. \nIn Bupa Global, revenue and underlying profit increased as a result of \nstrong customer retention and new business sales, cost management and \nimproved loss ratios due to pricing action. Across our regions, we continued \nto develop customer propositions, delivering product variants that respond \nto distinct local needs. We also implemented new claims adjudication and \nhealthcare management systems to continue to help our customers access \nhigh-quality, good-value care. \nThe COR for Bupa Insurance Limited, the UK-based insurance entity that \nunderwrites both domestic and international insurance, improved to 94%1 \n(2021: 97%). \nUK Dental's underlying losses increased due to sector-wide pressures, \nincluding an ongoing shortage of dentists, particularly for NHS work, \nincreased staff costs and high inflation.
