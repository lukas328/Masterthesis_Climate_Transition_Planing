The ICAPs Expectations \nLadder summarizes the key climate actions investors can take in the four focus areas of the Investor Agenda: \ninvestment, corporate engagement, policy advocacy, and investor disclosure. Governance is a crosscutting theme \nacross all four areas. \nAn example of an investor who has developed a climate action plan following this guidance is the New York State \nCommon Retirement Fund (CRF), one of the largest public pension plans in the United States. It published its \nClimate Action Plan222 in June 2019, which sets out its climate-related assessments, investments, engagement,  \nand advocacy work.\nFollowing publication of its Climate Action Plan, in December 2020, CRF announced its commitment to reduce \nGHG emissions from its entire portfolio to net zero by 2040.223 In April 2021 CRF issued a progress report on its \nClimate Action Plan. 224 In this report, CRF explains how it uses engagement to help mitigate its climate-related \nrisks. It files climate change-related shareholder resolutions, and it recently updated its proxy voting guidelines  \nto inc\nlude specific climate guidelines. \nCRF performs direct engagement with portfolio companies in high-impact climate sectors. 225 It urges companies \nto establish transition strategies, to develop strategic CapEx planning, to adopt GHG emissions targets, and to \ndisclose emissions data and other key climate-related disclosures. In addition, it engages its top global equity and \nfixed income external managers in areas of climate governance, risk management, engagement, proxy voting, and \nTCFD reporting. \nAs part of its public policy advocacy work, CRF has weighed in on a number of important climate-related \ninvestment and regulatory issues.226 Its advocacy work includes testifying, providing public comments, and \nparticipating i n state, \nnational, and international foru ms.\nENGAGEMENT STRATEGY\nCONTENTS  |  FINANCIAL INSTITUTION NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLANS — FUNDAMENTALS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND GUIDANCE\n74\nOverview and relevance: Public policy and227 \nregulation shape international, national, regional, \nand local strategies for transitioning to net zero, \nand will have significant impact on real-economy \ncorporations as well as financial institutions. \nFinancial institutions engage with a range of \ngovernment and public-sector institutions on a \nbroad set of topics through advocacy, lobbying, and \nother indirect channels, with the goal of influencing \nthe direction of policy and regulation.228, 229 \nGuidance: Financial institutions engaging with \npublic-sector institutions should proactively include \ntopics that support or enable an accelerated and \norderly transition to net zero. Several of these topics \nwere laid out in the GFANZ Policy Call to Action \n(published in October 2021, with an update on \nprogress published in November 2022) and could \nbe used to guide engagement with government and \npublic sector. Examples include the following:\n227 V ia a third party on behalf of the institution, such as an industry trade association.\n228 “\nGovernment/public sector” is defined broadly in this context, and includes policymakers, central banks, regulators, supervisors, \nand standard  setters.\n229 W GIII of IPCC emphasizes the importance of policy packages as well as individual policies, to enable innovation and build \ncapacity to support a shift toward equitable low-emissions futures. Refer to the Climate Change 2022: Mitigation of Climate \nChange: Summary for Policymakers  report.\n230 GFANZ. Guidance on Use of Sectoral Pathways for Financial Institutions , June 2022.\n231 T he NZIA paper, Insuring the net-zero transition: Evolving thinking and practices , 2022, offers the following observation: \n“Government policies that have a positive environmental impact often require more than one company to make changes… A key \nquestion for the NZIA is therefore how to implement cross-industry environmental initiatives while complying with antitrust laws \nand regulation…the NZIA and its members have begun to engage with antitrust regulators in global jurisdictions on the impact of \nantitrust laws and regulations on the net-zero agenda and the benefits possible with industry cooperation and approaches such as \nopen standard setting.” p. 34.\n232 N ZBA suggests that issues should be discussed with international standard setters, jurisdictional policymakers, and other \nstakeholders.
