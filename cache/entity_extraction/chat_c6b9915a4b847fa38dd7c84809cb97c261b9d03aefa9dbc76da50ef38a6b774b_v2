It was established in mid-2021 to ensure \nsufficient non-executive oversight and challenge to \nmanagement over Bupa’s sustainability activities. \nThe Committee’s principal role is to assist the Board \nin considering and approving its sustainability strategy \nand providing oversight of the implementation of that \nstrategy and of sustainability initiatives across Bupa, \nin line with Bupa’s purpose, ambition, values and \ncorporate strategy. \nThe Committee’s remit includes overseeing Bupa’s \nplans on environment and climate action, including the \nsetting of, and monitoring performance against, targets; \noverseeing and assessing Bupa’s overall contribution \nto, and impact on, society in the countries in which it \noperates; reviewing and recommending external \ndisclosures on sustainability and other ESG matters to \nthe Board; and considering Bupa’s position on relevant \nemerging sustainability issues. A full description of the \nCommittee’s role is set out in its Terms of Reference \nhere on bupa.com. \nThe Committee currently comprises four NEDs \nand the Group CEO. The Group CFO and Chief \nSustainability and People Officer regularly attend \nCommittee meetings. The Committee met four times \nduring the year, including one joint meeting with \nthe Audit Committee. \nKey activities in 2022 \nFollowing the Board’s decision to include sustainability \nas a strategic pillar of Bupa’s 3x6 strategy in 2021, \nwork was undertaken to develop a sustainability \nstrategy. Our key focus in 2022 was then to continue \nto refine this strategy and oversee its launch and \nimplementation. The Committee has also focused on \nstrengthening our assurance over our GHG emissions \ndata, working with the Audit Committee. \nSustainability strategy \nOur sustainability strategy sets out how we plan to \nachieve the ‘making a better world’ part of our purpose. \nThe Committee agreed that sustainability needs to be \nplaced at the core of Bupa’s business and aimed to \ndefine our sustainability ambitions. The sustainability \nstrategy aims to deliver health benefits for people and \nplanet and provide innovative solutions to the \nsustainability challenges we face, recognising that if \nour planet is not healthy, our own health will suffer too. \nThe Committee further agreed that the strategy must \nbe measurable against appropriate KPIs. In 2021, we \ncompleted a materiality assessment to ensure that \nour sustainability strategy focuses on the right areas, \nreflecting changes to the business and the external \nenvironment. In collaboration with an independent \nconsultancy, and through consultation with a range \nof internal and external stakeholders, the assessment \nidentified 19 material issues across ESG topics that \nhave the greatest potential to impact the business, \neither as a risk or opportunity, and matter most to\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
