tax revenue, \nwhich can result in tax audits, double taxation, arbitration, and law  - \nsuits� We recognise that reporting initiatives cannot stand alone and \nfocus on developing tools and governance mechanisms to limit the \nrisk of double taxation � We also apply withholding taxes correctly \nand allocate income between Vestas companies in accordance with \ninternational regulations

on the Global \nReporting Initiative (GRI) 207 standard, developed by the Global \nSustainability Standards Board (GSSB) � Our Tax Policy is available on \nour corporate website and includes: \n• An overall commitment and approach to responsible tax practice \n• A governance structure, where our tax policy is subject to annual \nreview and approval by the Board\n• An explicit policy on tax planning, disputes, and risk management \nIn 2022 we continued mapping our tax contribution based on our \ngeographical footprint � Through this process, we have ensured \ntraceability between financial disclosures, disclosures to tax \nauthorities, and our tax contribution report � We have based our \nreporting on actual tax payments, external revenue, and number of \nemployees to provide an objective and transparent measure � \n For consistency in our reporting, we have regionalised geographical \nsegmentation based on our financial disclosure � For an overview of \nour key tax ratios and country specific payments, see page 79-80 � \nOur aim is to demonstrate how we applied our tax principles and \nprovide more information about our tax footprint � We reconcile the \ninformation in

engage in an open dialogue with tax authorities � This \nprocess is often conducted on a bilateral basis, bringing all relevant \nparties to the table to reach a swift and fair settlement � Sometimes, \nsuch disputes can extend beyond ten years and consume significant \nresources � As a company, we pursue the interests of our sharehold -\ners and will defend our position where we consider this the
