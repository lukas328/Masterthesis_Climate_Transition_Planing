The \ncommittee retains the discretion to reduce any bonus award if, in its opinion, the underlying financial \nperformance of the company has not been satisfactory in the circumstances.\nDeferral\nOf any bonus paid, up to 50% is paid in cash and the remaining balance is deferred into shares for a \nthree-year period as an award under the deferred bonus plan. As defined in the relevant plan rules, no \nfurther performance conditions apply to awards under the Deferred Bonus Plan. Dividends that accrue on \nthe deferred shares during the vesting period will be paid in either cash and/or shares at the time of vesting.\nMalus and Clawback\nThe cash and deferred elements of the bonus are subject to malus and clawback provisions such that they \ncan be forfeited or recouped in part or in full in the event of a misstatement of results, error in the \ncalculation, misconduct by the individual or serious reputational damage.\nAdjustments\nThe Remuneration Committee retains discretion to change the performance targets if there is a significant \nand/or material event which causes the committee to believe the original targets are no longer appropriate \n(e.g. to reflect material acquisitions or disposals).\nThe Remuneration Committee also retains discretion to amend the level of annual bonuses determined \nby the performance condition to seek to ensure that the incentive structure for executive directors does \nnot raise environmental, social and governance risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour. \nFor example, reducing or eliminating bonuses where the company has suffered reputational damage \nor where other aspects of performance, including leadership behaviour, have been unacceptable.\nThe Remuneration Committee retains the ability to increase bonus awards from the formulaic outcome \nwhere there is identifiable and exceptional performance by the executive director. Bonus payments in such \ncircumstances would remain within the maximum bonus opportunity and shareholders would be fully \ninformed of the justification.\nMaximum opportunity and vesting thresholds\n• Chief Executive Officer – 180% of base salary.\n• Other executive directors – 150% of base salary.\nWhere financial measures are set the threshold performance level will \nresult in a bonus of up to 25% of the target bonus opportunity. On-target \nperformance will result in 50% payment of the maximum opportunity. \nWhere non-financial targets are set, it may not be practicable to set targets \non a sliding scale.\nPerformance measures\nBonuses are based on the achievement of demanding financial and, where \nappropriate, non-financial targets. The committee may use different \nperformances and/or weightings for each performance cycle as \nappropriate to take into account the strategic needs of the business. \nHowever, a substantial proportion (i.e. at least 60%) will be based on key \nfinancial measures, for example, underlying PBT. \nTargets are set applying a robust bottom-up process to achieve full \naccountability. The financial performance targets are retrospectively \npublished in the immediately following Annual Report on Remuneration. \nDetails of last year’s bonus awards are on pages 106 and120.\nThe performance period for annual bonus purposes matches the financial \nyear (currently 1st April to 31st March).\nPerformance Share Plan\nThe Performance Share Plan \n(PSP) is designed to ensure \nthat executives take decisions \nin the interest of the \nlonger-term success of the \ngroup. Having measures that \nlook at profitable growth and \nperformance relative to a \ncomparator group over the \nlonger term ensures that the \ninterests of executives are \naligned with shareholder \ninterest for long-term value.\nShares may be awarded each year and are subject to performance conditions tested over a minimum \nthree- year performance period. Subject to the performance conditions being met the shares will vest after \nwhich the directors will be required to hold any vested shares until the fifth anniversary of the award.\nThe performance targets are set by the Remuneration Committee based on internal and external growth \nforecasts to ensure they remain appropriate and aligned with shareholder expectations.\nThe awards are granted in accordance with the rules of the plan approved by shareholders. The maximum \naward level is 250% of base salary. Awards may be granted in the form of conditional shares, nil or nominal \ncost options or cash (where the awards cannot be settled in shares). Dividends that accrue during the \npost-vesting holding period will be managed in accordance with our dividend re-investment process.\nMalus and clawback\nPSP awards are subject to malus and clawback provisions that can apply in the case of a misstatement of \nresults, error in the calculation, misconduct by the individual, serious reputational damage, failures of risk \nmanagement or corporate failure.\nAward levels and vesting thresholds\nThe maximum award level is 250% of salary.\nThe current award levels are:\n• Chief Executive Officer – 250% of base salary\n• Other Executive Directors – 175% of salary.\nThreshold performance will result in vesting of up to a maximum of 25% \nfor each performance measure. The actual threshold vesting will depend \non the performance metric and the performance range set for the specific \naward. Vesting at maximum is 100% of the relevant part of the award, \nincreasing on a graduated scale. \nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 2023108\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION\nRemuneration Policy continued\nPurpose and link to strategy Operation (and changes if appropriate) of the element Potential value of\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
