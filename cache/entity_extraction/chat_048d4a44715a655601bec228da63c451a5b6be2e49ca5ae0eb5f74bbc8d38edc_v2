Any such change \nwould be fully explained to shareholders.\nPerformance measures\nPSP awards vest over a minimum three-year performance period and will \nbe subject to financial and/or shareholder return targets. In addition, \nstrategic and/or sustainability targets may be included in future awards. \nIn all cases, the majority of the award will remain linked to financial \nand/or shareholder return targets.\nIt is expected that during the policy period the following three metrics \nwill form the majority of awards:\na) The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of underlying EPS;\nb) The Total Shareholder Return (TSR) relative to a comparator group \n(e.g. the FTSE 31-100 excluding financial services companies);\nc) Strategic and/or sustainability targets.\nVesting is also subject to a broad committee discretion that will enable \nthe committee to adjust the extent to which an award vests by exercising \nappropriate discretion to the formulaic outcomes in order to reflect \nthe wider financial performance and / or circumstances of the group.\nThe prospective weightings, targets and measures for the year \ncommencing 1st April 2023 are shown on page 122.\nThe Remuneration Committee retains the discretion to amend the \nweightings, targets and the performance measures detailed on page 122 \nfor future awards as appropriate to reflect the business strategy. \nAll employee share plan\nEncourages share ownership Executive directors are entitled to participate in the company’s all-employee plan under which regular \nmonthly share purchases are made and matched with the award of company shares, subject to \nretention conditions.\nExecutive directors would also be entitled to participate in any other all-employee arrangements that \nmay be established by the company on the same terms as all other employees.\nExecutive directors are entitled to participate up to the same limits in force \nfrom time to time for all employees.\nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 2023 109\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION\nRemuneration Policy continued\nPurpose and link to strategy Operation (and changes if appropriate) of the element Potential value of element and performance measures\nShareholding requirements\nTo encourage executive \ndirectors to build a \nshareholding in the company \nand ensure the interests of \nmanagement are aligned with \nthose of shareholders\nExecutive directors are expected to build up a shareholding in the company over a reasonable period \nof time, and upon cessation of employment are expected to retain a shareholding for a period of up \nto two years.\nShares that count towards achieving these guidelines while an executive director include: all shares \nbeneficially owned by an executive director, or a person connected to the executive as recognised by the \nRemuneration Committee; deferred bonus shares and PSP awards which have vested and so are no longer \nsubject to performance conditions but are within a holding period.\nExecutive directors are expected to retain at least 50% of the net (after tax) vested shares that are released \nunder the PSP and Deferred Bonus Plan until the required levels of shareholding are achieved.\nExecutive directors are not required to make personal share purchases should awards not meet the \nperformance conditions and so a newly appointed director may take longer to reach the expected level, \ndepending on the company’s performance against targets over the period. In addition, a director who \nceases employment with the company is not required to purchase shares to satisfy the post-cessation \nshareholding requirement.\nThe minimum shareholding requirement while an executive director \nand for the two-year period after cessation of employment is as follows:\n• Chief Executive Officer – 250% of base salary.\n• Other executive directors – 200% of base salary.\nIf the executive director has not been able to build up their shareholding \nprior to cessation they are not required to purchase shares upon cessation \nto satisfy the requirement.\nThere is no requirement for non-executive directors to hold shares, \nbut they are encouraged to acquire a holding over time.\nNon-executive director fees\nTo attract, retain and motivate \nnon-executive directors with \nthe required knowledge and \nexperience.\nNon-executive director fees are determined by the board and the non-executive directors exclude \nthemselves from these discussions.\nThe fees for the Chair are determined by the Remuneration Committee taking into account the views of the \nChief Executive Officer. The Chair excludes himself from these discussions.\nNon-executive directors are paid a base fee each year with an additional fee for each committee Chair or \nadditional role held.\nNon-executive director fees are reviewed every year. Any increase will take into account the market rate for \nthe relevant positions within the comparator group of similarly sized companies with a comparable \ninternational presence and geographic spread and operating in relevant industry sectors and the \nexperience of the individuals and the expected time commitment of the role.\nIn exceptional circumstances, additional fees or non-executive benefits (\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
