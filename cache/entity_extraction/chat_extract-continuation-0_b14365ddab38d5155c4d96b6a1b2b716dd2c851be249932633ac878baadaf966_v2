Capital markets activity, structured products \n(such as derivatives, hedging or trading) and tax equity-financed projects are excluded from this scope of \nanalysis at this time.\nThe financial reporting year has been determined as January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021. Financial values \nrelated to client loan exposure and company financials have been aligned to this year-end date where \npossible, or we have taken information as of the company’s closest financial reporting year-end date.\nThroughout this report, we offer our emissions calculations based on two components of client exposure: \n • Outstanding amount: value of the loan that the borrower has drawn down as of the year-end date. \n • Committed amount: outstanding amount plus undrawn committed credit which the borrower has \navailable, less any amounts related to fronting facilities.\nSector portfolios are identified using an internal industry classification system, further detailed below. \nAuto Manufacturing\nThe industry boundary for Auto Manufacturing focuses on Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) of \nlight-duty vehicles.\nCommercial Real Estate\nTo evaluate each counterparty’s emissions performance, we focus on GHG emissions associated with the \ndirect financing of existing buildings in North America, excluding properties under construction as of \nDecember 31, 2021, land and lot development, agricultural properties, indirect financing (e.g., Real Estate \nInvestment Trusts (REITs) and Real Estate Operating Companies (REOCs), or securitized assets) and \nproperties located outside of North America. This exclusion is in part due to data limitations and lack of \noperational emissions from said property types in our loan book. Since data quality for this sector is best in \n \nAppendix B\nTCFD REPORT 2022: CITI’S APPROACH TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND NET ZERO | 71\nNorth America, and much of our financing within the real estate space is located within North America, we \nare currently looking at only North American properties. \nEnergy and Power\nFor industry descriptions, see our 2021 TCFD Report. For project finance loans, we include actively \noperating electricity generation-related assets in the reporting year for the Power sector and actively \noperating projects in the Energy sector , which include midstream assets. \nSteel \nWe have followed the Sustainable STEEL Principles (SSP) guidance to determine in-scope counterparties, \nfocusing on crude steel producers, while excluding stainless steel producers and fabricators from the scope \nof our financed emissions reporting.\nSuggested NAICS to identify these counterparties include: \nThermal Coal Mining \nThe in-scope counterparties were determined to include thermal coal mining companies with \n≥5% revenue generated from thermal coal mining activities. Mining companies that only produce \nmetallurgical coal were excluded. For companies that produce both thermal coal and metallurgical coal, \nfinanced emissions calculations are inclusive of Scope 1 and 2 emissions resulting from both thermal and \nmetallurgical coal activities. \n  Business Loans Calculation Methodology     \nScopes 1 & 2     \nScope 1 and 2 emissions have been included in the financed emissions calculations for all clients  \nwithin the covered sectors: Auto Manufacturing, Energy, Power , Steel, and Thermal Coal Mining.
