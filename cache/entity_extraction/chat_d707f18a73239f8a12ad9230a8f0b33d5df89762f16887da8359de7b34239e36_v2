During 2022 Retail Banking provided £2.2 billion in Green Mortgages(1). NatWest \nGroup provided £4.2 billion funding towards EPC A and B residential mortgages during 2022, with £5.2 billion \ncumulative contribution towards our climate and sustainable funding and financing target. As part of this, and to \nfurther support decarbonisation, we aim to provide at least £10 billion in lending for EPC A and B rated \nresidential properties between 1 January 2023 and the end of 2025. Emissions intensity for EPC A and B \nmortgages at 13.8kgCO2e/m2 is lower than emissions intensity on our full mortgage portfolio.\n • Working with Sustainable Homes and Buildings Coalition partners (NatWest Group, British Gas, Worcester \nBosch, Shelter and Citizens Advice) to understand key customer and market barriers to retrofitting, and using \nthis information to influence government policy change. In 2022, the Sustainable Homes Coalition published its \nProgress Report that followed nine customers in their retrofit journey, surfacing key limitations faced by \ncustomers in undertaking retrofits, e.g. ill-equipped supply chain, opaque funding options, etc. \n • Green Homes Attitudes Tracker: a quarterly survey with NatWest Group and IHS Markit that tracks customer \nsentiment towards energy efficiency and environmental concerns over time. The increase in energy prices \nmeans that over 65% of homeowners plan to make energy efficiency improvements to their property this \ndecade, though financing the upfront costs for retrofits is the single largest barrier for most owners.\n • Smart Home Thermostat pilot: to understand customer behaviour and emissions reduction potential.\n • Financial health checks and EPC updates: Customers can access their EPC data alongside other mortgage \ninformation on our portal to drive awareness and action. We have also included energy efficiency related \nquestions in our Financial Health Checks with customers, bringing the conversation to the frontline.\n • Retrofit Portal: During 2023, we will work to deliver an online portal to provide an end-to-end solution for \nhomeowners to find accredited builders that can carry out retrofits, have access to necessary technologies and \nmaterials for the chosen retrofit, and appropriate financing solutions. Refer to Case Study: Making our homes \nmore sustainable on page 35 for an example of products and services for residential mortgages in practice.\nCommercial real estate:\n • Lending to support transition: this includes Sustainability Linked Loans as well as retrofit loans to finance \nimprovements in properties that will make them more energy efficient.\n • Risk appetite for development of new build homes has been restricted to only finance EPC A and B homes \nsince 2020, supporting the development of most energy efficient housing stock.\nHousing associations:\n • Green and transition lending: The demand to accelerate the UK’s transition to net zero comes as a \ncost-of-living crisis deepens, with the energy efficiency of homes being a topical issue. Retrofitting properties to \nreduce energy bills has become a key focus, particularly for the most deprived areas of society. We have made \ngood progress in supporting the sector on its climate journey so far, and financing retrofit and new development \nat EPC A or B continue to be our key levers. During 2022, we have provided £0.6 billion funding to the housing \nassociation sector through Sustainability Linked Loans, which included Environmental KPIs linked to improving \nthe energy efficiency of the housing stock.\n • In February 2023, we have announced that we will collectively work with Pineapple Sustainable Partnerships, \nPlaces for People, British Gas Centrica and Schneider Electric on a pilot to retrofit thousands of homes in \nthe social housing sector.\nConstruction:\nThe construction sector plays a key role in building low carbon and climate resilient transport and renewable \ninfrastructure, as well as constructing net zero buildings. The UK CCC estimates that £50 billion per annum of \ncapital expenditure is required for the manufacturing and construction, buildings and network infrastructure sectors \nfor the UK to meet its net zero targets. This illustrates the commercial opportunity to support this sector to \ndecarbonise, and the benefit of ‘saving carbon’ in other sectors by supporting green activity. We will continue to \nprovide green asset finance to support our customers’ switch to low carbon materials and technologies. In \nFebruary 2022 NatWest Group joined CO2nstruct Zero as a partner, which brings together organisations that are \ndemonstrating leadership in relation to carbon reduction and recognises the global role of construction in meeting \nthe net-zero challenge. To help cultivate a more mature retrofit supply chain, we are also exploring how we can \nwork with the Supply Chain Sustainability School to share knowledge and build the skills needed to retrofit homes \nand buildings across the UK.\nWe will continue to evolve our products and services offering to support our customers and in turn the \nUK’s property sector decarbonisation. \n(1) Green mortgages are available to all intermediaries for all residential and Buy-to-Let properties with an energy performance rating of A \nor B and specific new build developer properties.
