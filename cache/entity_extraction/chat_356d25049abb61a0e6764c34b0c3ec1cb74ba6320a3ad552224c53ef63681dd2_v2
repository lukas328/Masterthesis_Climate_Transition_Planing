MBS refers to incentive earned in respect of 2022 performance with 50% deferred until March 2026. In the deferral period, continued employment is \nrequired for payout. \n2. GPP refers to the previous long-term incentive scheme. Due to a change in the design of Bupa’s long-term incentive plan, no schemes are vesting \nending 2022. Final deferred payout of the 2019 Group Performance Plan, which vested at the end of 2019, will occur in March 2023. \n3. Pension figures reflect a cash allowance paid to Executive Directors in lieu of company contributions into a pension scheme and are in line with the \nwider workforce. \n4. Iñaki Ereño’s benefit figure includes a housing allowance of £120,000 (net) and tax support services both of which are grossed up to meet the costs \nof the appropriate tax. \n5. James Lenton’s benefit figure includes certain travel and subsistence expenses that are treated as taxable, grossed up to meet the costs of the \nadditional tax. \n2022 MBS measures and performance (Audited) \nFor 2022, the Group CEO’s target MBS opportunity was 100% of salary, with a maximum of 200%. The Group \nCFO’s target MBS opportunity was 75% of salary, with a maximum of 150% of salary. \nThe performance measures used to determine the 2022 MBS for our Executive Directors were as follows: \n▪ Group profit (55% of award) – management profit excluding mark to market used for MBS differs from \nunderlying profit before taxation, with the most significant difference being the exclusion of amortisation \nof acquired intangible assets. \n▪ Group revenue (10% of award) – this includes Bupa’s proportionate share of revenue from associates and \njoint ventures, which is not included within reported revenue. \n▪ Cost efficiency (10% of award) – this is a measure focused on ensuring that we are running the business \nefficiently, calculated as overhead costs divided by revenue. \n▪ Customer objectives (6.25% of award) – this measure includes targets to improve our Customer Excellence \nFramework standards. \n▪ Customer NPS (18.75% of award) – this is a measure to drive improvement of our Net Promoter Score. \nAlongside the measures that make up the MBS scorecard, the MBS outcome is subject to an overall adjustment \nrelating to risk management across Bupa as determined by the Committee, assisted by contributions from the \nRisk Committee and the Risk Review Panel. The overall result generates a BPM that is applied along with the IPM \nto target bonus generating the annual MBS payout for each individual. \nAs detailed in the Committee Chair’s letter, in determining the annual MBS outcomes, the Committee applied \ndiscretion to ensure that management were not penalised for reimbursing health insurance customers in line with \nour commitment to not benefit from COVID-19 in our Australian health insurance business. Also related to this \ncommitment, the Committee agreed to remove £66m of claims savings related to COVID-19. The other area which \nthe Committee considered this year was the impact on statutory profit of the impairment of intangible assets and \ngoodwill arising on business combinations, concluding that the current executive team were not responsible for \nthe material factors leading to the impairment and should therefore not be penalised for the statutory loss; no \nadditional adjustment would be applied to any former executive team member. \nThe Group CEO received an IPM of 150% in recognition of providing inspirational leadership with the execution \nand delivery of the new transformative strategy, focusing on customers and performance, and leading to real \nunderlying growth. The Group CEO has also shown commitment to making Bupa the very best place to work \nand in 2022 Bupa received its highest ever result on employee engagement. \nThe Group CFO received an IPM of 130% in recognition of a successful first full year in role, ensuring that we invest \nin capabilities to accelerate our 3x6 strategy; transform Group Finance to include establishing a Corporate \nDevelopment team; and develop a capital management strategy to evaluate opportunities. \nBupa Annual Report 2022 85 \n                \n \n  \n   \n \n \n    \n \n  \n \n \n    \n \n  \n \n    \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n             \n             \n               \n               \n               \n      \n                        \n                      \n           \n            \n \n \n  \n  \n     \n             \n             \n        \n                  \n    \n                  \n                   \n               \n       \n \n \n  \n   \n  \n   \n  \n  \n  \n       \n       \n                  \n                 \n     \n  \n \n   \n  \n  \n \n \n                \n                \n                \n                   \n               \n       \n \n \n                 \n            \n             \n            \n               \n        \n               \n               \n            \n             \n                  \n               \n               \n           \n                   \n      \n          \n  \n   \n   \nStrategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements \nDirectors’ remuneration report \nPart 2: Implementation continued \nThe financial targets and actual performance for the 2022 MBS are set out in the tables below. \nOn target \nThreshold (100%) Stretch (125%) Actual Final Weighted \nperformance performance performance performance Business Business \n2022 MBS payout1 \n% weighting of \nmeasure \nlevel £(m) or % \nif indicated \nlevel £(m) or % \nif indicated \nlevel £(m) or % \nif indicated \nlevel £(m) or \n% if indicated \nPerformance \nMultiplier \nPerformance \nMultiplier \nGroup profit2 55% 421 467 514 558 125\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
