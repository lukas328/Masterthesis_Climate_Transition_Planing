As the funding level of the plans improve and hit pre-agreed triggers, plan investments are \nswitched from return-seeking assets to liability-matching assets.  \nThe plans implement partial currency hedging on their overseas assets to mitigate currency risk. \nInterest (discount) rate risk  \nLiabilities are sensitive to movements in bond yields (interest rates), with lower \ninterest rates leading to an increase in the valuation of liabilities, albeit the impact \non the plan’s funding level will be partially offset by an increase in the value of its \nbond holdings. \nThe group’s defined benefit plans hold a high proportion of their assets in government or corporate bonds, \nwhich provide a natural hedge against falling interest rates. \nIn the UK, this interest rate hedge is extended by the use of interest rate swaps, such that the plan is 100% \nhedged on the plan’s funding basis. The swaps are held with several banks to reduce counterparty risk. \nInflation risk  \nLiabilities are sensitive to movements in inflation, with higher inflation leading to an \nincrease in the valuation of liabilities. \nWhere plan benefits provide inflation-related increases, the plan holds some inflation-linked assets which \nprovide a natural hedge against higher than expected inflation increases. \nIn the UK, this inflation hedge is extended by the use of inflation swaps, such that the plan is 100% hedged \non the plan’s funding basis. The swaps are held with several banks to reduce counterparty risk. \nLongevity risk  \nThe majority of the group’s defined benefit plans provide benefits for the life of the \nmember, so the liabilities are sensitive to life expectancy, with increases in life \nexpectancy leading to an increase in the valuation of liabilities. \nThe group has closed most of its defined benefit pension plans to new entrants, replacing them with either a \ncash balance plan or defined contribution plans, both of which are unaffected by life expectancy.  \nFor the plans where a benefit for life continues to be payable, prudent mortality assumptions are used that \nappropriately allow for a future improvement in life expectancy. These assumptions are reviewed on a \nregular basis. \nLiquidity risk  \nThe pension plan may have insufficient access to cash to meet its short-term cash and \ncollateral obligations, such that adverse scenarios could force the sale of a less-liquid \nassets at depressed prices. \nThe group’s defined benefit plans hold sufficient liquid assets to meet its cashflow obligations and the \ncollateral requirements of its inflation and interest rate hedging. This reduces the risk of being a forced seller \nof less-liquid assets. \n \n  \nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 2023 185\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION\nNotes on the Accounts continued for the year ended 31st March 2023 \n186 \n24 Post-employment benefits continued \nGroup continued \nContributions \nDuring the year, total contributions to the group’s post-employment defined benefit plans were £40 million (2022: £43 million).
