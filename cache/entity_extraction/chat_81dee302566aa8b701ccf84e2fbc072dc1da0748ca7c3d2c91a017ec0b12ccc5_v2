In case of insufficient \nprogress against our objectives, we consider \nescalation strategies such as writing letters to the \nboard, public statements, recommending voting \nagainst management and as a last resort, \ndivestment. Where our engagement does not lead \nto change after more than three years of dialogue, \nwe are intending to recommend the exclusion  \nof assets that do not align with our climate and \nsustainability strategy. \nCase study: Asset manager  \nabrdn’s engagement with Enel\nDuring 2022 abrdn (our asset management \npartner) engaged with Enel (a multinational \nmanufacturer and distributor of electricity \nand gas) directly and collectively as part of \nthe CA100+ initiative. abrdn welcomed that \nEnel’s net zero target had been brought \nforward from 2050 to 2040, that the \ncompany planned to disclose emissions \nacross all scopes and that targets had been \nsubmitted to SBTi. However, they had \nconcerns the ESG weighting of the Long \nTerm Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) was to be \nreduced from 25% to 20%, and as a \nconsequence the metric related to \nrenewable energy was to be removed.\nThe key objective of abrdn’s collaborative \nengagement was to seek alignment of Enel’s \ndisclosures to the Net Zero Benchmark, \nwhich was launched by CA100+ in March \n2021, and calls for robust and comparable \ninformation on how companies are realigning \ntheir business strategies and operations with \nthe goals of the Paris Agreement.\nIn view of abrdn’s concerns regarding the \nremoval of the renewables metric, they \ndecided to vote against the LTIP at the \nAGM. They will review any changes made \nto the LTIP structure prior to voting at the \n2023 AGM.\nTogether with the two CA100+ co-leads, \nabrdn were pleased to acknowledge that in \nNovember 2022, Enel became the first and \nonly company to fully align their corporate \ndisclosures with the CA100+ Net Zero\nCompany Benchmark.\nNote: Company selected for illustrative purposes only to \ndemonstrate the investment management style described \nherein and not as an investment recommendation or \nindication of future performance. \n3\n37\nPhoenix Group Holdings plc Net Zero Transition Plan\nInvest Engage Lead\nEmbedding net zero \nin our business\nBecoming a \nnet zero business Measuring our progress\nExecutive \nsummary\nExecute actions continued \n3. Investing in climate solutions\nThe third lever for decarbonising our \ninvestment portfolio is to actively \ninvest in climate solutions. We are \nseeking to increase our investment in \nclimate solutions required to deliver \nnet zero, where regulatory and market \nconditions allow.\nIt is estimated that around £2.7 trillion of investment \nwill be required over the next 15 years to meet \nthe UK’s emission reduction goals, and that the \ninsurance sector has the potential to fund up to \na third of this investment, subject to market \nconditions, organisation credit/risk appetite and \ndeal flow that meets asset eligibility criteria such \nas Solvency II matching adjustment criteria. \nIlliquid assets investments\nWe invested c. £2.3bn of  our shareholder portfolio \nin sustainable illiquid assets over 2021 and 2022. As \na result, we have made good progress against our \nlong-term ambition to deploy £10 billion in direct \ninvestments in sustainable and/or productive \nopportunities by year-end 2025, of which climate \nsolutions is one of the elements. To date we have \noriginated c.£0.7 billion in climate solutions. \nLooking ahead, we welcome the reforms to \nSolvency II regulations as an important component \nof the changes needed to the wider UK investment \nlandscape to enable us to meet our ambition to \ninvest more in the future. The UK lags behind other \nmajor developed nations in terms of its investment \nin alternative assets. Currently, only 9% of assets \nin UK pension funds are invested in this way \ncompared to 23% in the other major pension \nmarkets. With the necessary conditions, such as \nthe right regulatory framework and access to \ntransformative investment projects that offer an \nattractive returns profile, Phoenix could invest up \nto £40 billion in sustainable and/or productive \nassets to support economic growth, levelling up \nand the climate change agenda. As ever, a key \npriority will be to deliver good outcomes for our \ncustomers and this will continue to inform our \ninvestment decision-making process.\nInvestment in climate solution funds\nIn 2022, we selected an asset management partner \nto support us in designing a multi-asset ‘climate \nsolutions’ mandate, which we will deploy \nc.£338 million of policyholder assets into in 2023. \nThe portfolio will allocate capital to enable the \ntransition to a low-carbon world, through both \nreducing emissions (mitigation) and increasing \nclimate change resilience (adaptation).
