In parallel, we will further encourage more transparency and reporting \ngoing forward. To this end, we will follow through on our existing energy guidelines, engage the top 100 \nclients per year that do not yet disclose their emissions, and work together with key clients in hard-to-abate \nsectors to foster knowledge exchange and arrive at emission reductions. \n \nIn addition, we aim to continue scaling up renewable energy and low-carbon technology solutions in our \nportfolio, supported now by the target to profitably grow revenues from transition solutions in Commercial \nProperty Damage as well as Business Interruption coverages by +150% by 2030 vs. 2022.16 \n \nFor motor retail, the targets cover roughly half of the premium and associated emissions of the motor \nretail segment. We are focusing our efforts on the most relevant markets for Allianz, where adequate and \nreliable data is also available.17 We aim to reduce carbon emissions in these portfolios by 30% by 2030 vs. \nour 2022 base year. The biggest levers to achieving this will be increasing our share of electric vehicles as \nwell as incentivizing customers to drive less. Therefore, we have set two additional sub-targets: by 2030, we \nwill engage with 20 million current and potential customers to support their transition to electric mobility \nand we are committing to offering comprehensive insurance products for battery electric vehicles and the \nrelated ecosystem, to support our customers in transitioning to this new technology. Therefore, the share of \nbattery electric vehicles (based on the number of passenger vehicles) in the Allianz motor portfolio will \nexceed the share of battery electric vehicles in the respective markets. Another key lever will be providing \nincentives for reducing emissions via mileage-based product offerings, as part of our existing sustainable \nsolutions offering, which is explained in detail in our Group Sustainability Report 2022.18 \n \nThe scope of these targets is to be expanded over time, similarly to our proprietary investment targets. \n  \n \n15 As per the PCAF Standard for Insurance-Associated Emissions – Link \n16 Transition solutions are defined as the solutions mentioned in the Allianz renewable/low-carbon energy guideline plus additionally \ncarbon capture and storage, battery storage and grid-stability-related investments, electric transportation: EV & battery \nmanufacturing plants, electric mass transit infrastructure construction (rail), certified green buildings, industry projects related to \nenergy transition (ammonia and bio-based fuels) \n17 This inaugural target applies to the following markets: Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, \nUK. \n18 Group Sustainability Report 2022 Chapter 2.1.4 – Link \n \n \n \n 7/8 \n \n \n \nTarget \nSector \nTarget  \nLayer \nMeasure  \n(Target year 2030) \nCorporate \nSub-portfolio • AGCS Corporate portfolio (all sectors) GHG emission intensity \nreduction of 45% (2022 base year) \nEngagement • Transparency Engagement for top 100 clients with no emissions \ndisclosure per year  \n• Knowledge sharing and exchange on best practices with \ntransportation clients (marine and aviation) \n• Transition Engagement for 2–3 companies per year \nInsuring  \ntransition \n• Ambition of at least 150% business growth of transition \nsolutions in Allianz Commercial Property Damage & Business \nInterruption coverages \nMotor \nRetail  \nSub-portfolio • Motor retail carbon emission reduction of 30% (2022 base year) \n(PCAF scope) \nEngagement • Engage with 20 million customers / potential customers to \nsupport their transition to electric mobility  \nInsuring  \ntransition \n• Share of battery electric vehicles (number of passenger \nvehicles) in the Allianz motor portfolio will exceed the share of \nbattery electric vehicles in the respective markets  \n \n \n3. Asset management19 \n \nFor clients seeking net-zero products, our asset managers Allianz Global Investors and PIMCO offer a set \nof approaches and tools to decarbonize portfolios over time. As fiduciaries, our asset managers work \nwith clients who are interested in various ESG20 aspects, on investment strategies and considerations to \nhelp achieve climate-related objectives, including decarbonization and net-zero emissions. \n \nPIMCO has developed an approach for clients seeking to align their fixed-income portfolios to their \ndecarbonization goals including net-zero objectives. It consists broadly of four pillars to help clients \ndecarbonize their portfolios, which can all be sub-targets: reduce carbon intensity, invest in climate leaders, \nsupport climate solutions, and influence change. 21 \n \nAllianzGI offers climate thematic and impact-driven opportunities such as green bonds and climate \ntransition equity and private markets renewable energy investments. These specialized assets can help to \nalign an asset owner’s portfolio with climate transition targets.22  \n \nFurther information on the offerings of our asset managers can be accessed here: our approach to \nsustainable investing (allianzgi.com) and ESG at PIMCO (pimco.com).  \n \n \n19 For the avoidance of doubt, this Inaugural Transition Plan applies only for Allianz’s proprietary investments, not for third-party \nassets  \n20 Environmental, social, and good governance. \n21 For more details see PIMCO ESG Investing (ESG Investing Report | PIMCO). \n22 For more details see AllianzGI Sustainability and Stewardship Report 2022 (Sustainability and Stewardship Report 2022 | AllianzGI). \nTable 3: New 2030 Targets for Property & Casualty Insurance \n \n \n \n 8/8 \n \n4.
