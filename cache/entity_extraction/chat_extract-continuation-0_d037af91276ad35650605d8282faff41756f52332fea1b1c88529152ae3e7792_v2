The three limits do not currently influence lending decisions, rather they are used to \nmonitor the performance of the current Retail Banking mortgage portfolio and new mortgage \nbusiness, focusing on transition risk through EPCs and the physical risk of flood, as follows:\nIn line with our ambition to at least halve the climate impact of our financing activity by 2030 \nand support our wholesale customers’ transition to net zero, during 2022, we evolved the \ninclusion of climate-related considerations within our credit assessment processes.\nEPC A and B properties Minimum EPCs for \nbuy-to-let properties \nFlats, new builds, and buy-to-let \nproperties at high or very  \nhigh risk of flood.\n • A shadow operational \nlimit was introduced to \ntrack lending to \nproperties with an EPC \nof A or B.\n • This means that we can \nproactively monitor and \nmanage climate-related \nrisk to the residential \nmortgage portfolio.\n • It also allows us to \nmonitor our ambition \nthat 50% of our UK \nmortgage portfolio has \nan EPC rating of C or \nbetter by 2030.\n • Through our monitoring \nof emerging regulations \nand legislation we \nanticipate changes \nwhich will require a \nminimum EPC of C for \nbuy-to-let properties \nfrom 2028.\n • In light of this, a shadow \noperational limit to \nmonitor our exposure \nto buy-to-let properties \nwithout the potential \nto reach an EPC of C \nwas introduced in 2022. \n • A shadow operational limit was \nintroduced to monitor Retail Banking \nmortgage portfolio exposure to \nproperties ineligible for the Flood Re \nscheme.\n • Backed by the government and in place \nuntil 2039, FloodRe enables customers \nwhose home is in a high or very high \nflood risk area to obtain affordable \nbuildings insurance.\n • Some properties are ineligible, including \nflats, buy-to-let properties and any \nproperty built since 2010.\n • The limit is designed to bring our \nexposure to ineligible properties in higher \nflood risk areas in line with the overall \nportfolio.\n • At 31 December 2022, 39% of \nproperties in our mortgage portfolio \nat high and very high risk of flood are \nineligible for FloodRe, compared with \n32% ineligible across the total portfolio.\nWe are applying operational limits in full in 2023, with timely remedial action required for limit breaches. \nConsideration of how these limits impact our customer journeys will continue.\nUpdating our criteria for decision-\nmaking and limiting concentration risk\nEnhancing wholesale credit applications \nto consider climate risk  \nThe effective management of climate risk requires the full integration of climate-related risk factors into strategic planning, transactions, and decision-making. This section details the enhancements which \nhave been made to our processes for managing climate-related risk to date, and those which will continue to evolve and improve as the organisation matures its climate risk management capabilities.\nTransaction Acceptance Standards (TAS) continue to be informed by climate-related risk \nfactors and are subject to periodic review. The intention is to use insights from \nheightened climate-related risk sector reviews to inform acceptance standards, as they \nevolve and where appropriate, ensuring we capture both risks and opportunities.\nImprovements have been made in the understanding of potential climate-related risk \nfactors affecting customers, including:\n • Further analysis of minimum energy efficiency standards.\n • Expanding the scope of our flood risk assessment to include five and 30-year scenarios.\n • Enhancing flood risk insight, modelling additional physical factors such as rising sea levels, and \nbroadened scope to include subsidence risk, as appropriate.\nCredit assessment processes have been improved to better support customer interactions, \nincluding:\n • We have mandatory climate conversations with in-scope(1) customers. These conversations \nreflect the specificity of sector and asset class, and the size and sophistication of these \ncustomers.\n • The climate scorecards described in section 4.2 are utilised, where applicable, to support \nthese conversations and the outcomes are captured within the credit assessment process.\n • To support our conversations with customers, enhancements have been made to guidance \nmaterials including the climate Transaction Acceptance Standards (TAS) handbook.\n • Role-specific learning rolled out to colleagues – see page 64\n(1) Guidance on in scope customers is tailored to each business area and detailed in the Climate TAS Handbook. For \nexample, for Business Banking Relationship Managers the criteria is - new or increased lending applications of \n£50,000 or more.\n63NatWest Group plc | 2022 Climate-related Disclosures Report\nGovernance Strategy and Climate transition plan Risk Management and Scenario Analysis Metrics and TargetsIntroduction\nManaging our exposure to climate\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NATWEST GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>NATWEST GROUP is a major banking and financial services organization actively participating in industry initiatives to address climate-related risks and develop solutions for limitations in the financial sector, including climate risk management and regulatory compliance)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLIMATE FINANCIAL RISK FORUM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Climate Financial Risk Forum (CFRF) is an industry initiative focused on developing best practices and frameworks for managing climate-related financial risks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS ASSOCIATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Global Financial Markets Association is an industry body involved in climate data initiatives to promote sustainable finance practices)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BANK OF ENGLAND<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Bank of England hosts conferences and discussions on the treatment of climate risk within the regulatory capital framework, influencing financial stability and risk management policies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLIMATE RISK<|>EVENT<|>Climate risk refers to the potential financial and operational impacts on organizations due to climate change, including physical risks like flooding and transition risks related to policy and market shifts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EPC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) is a rating system used to assess the energy efficiency of properties, influencing lending and risk management decisions in the bank's mortgage portfolio)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FLOOD RE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>FloodRe is a government-backed scheme that provides affordable insurance for properties at high or very high flood risk, with certain properties ineligible, affecting the bank's exposure monitoring)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATWEST GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>NATWEST GROUP monitors its mortgage portfolio's exposure to properties with high flood risk and EPC ratings, aiming to support climate transition and manage physical risks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLIMATE TRANSITION PLAN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Climate Transition Plan outlines NATWEST GROUP's strategies to support customers' transition to net zero, including evolving credit assessment processes and operational limits)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RISK MANAGEMENT<|>EVENT<|>Risk management involves integrating climate-related risks into governance, strategy, and operational frameworks to mitigate potential adverse impacts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCENARIO ANALYSIS<|>EVENT<|>Scenario analysis in climate risk involves evaluating potential future physical and transition risks under different climate scenarios to inform decision-making)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLIMATE DATA INITIATIVE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Climate Data Initiative is a project by industry bodies like the Global Financial Markets Association to improve climate-related data collection and analysis for better risk assessment)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONFERENCE ON THE TREATMENT OF CLIMATE RISK<|>EVENT<|>A conference hosted by the Bank of England to discuss regulatory approaches and best practices for managing climate-related financial risks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLIMATE RISK<|>EVENT<|>Climate risk encompasses physical risks like flooding and rising sea levels, as well as transition risks from policy changes, affecting financial institutions and their portfolios)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RISK AND GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Frameworks within NATWEST GROUP that align climate initiatives with risk appetite, governance, and management information systems to ensure comprehensive risk oversight)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MANAGEMENT INFORMATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Management information systems developed by NATWEST GROUP to track and enhance climate scenario analysis capabilities and overall climate risk management)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLIMATE SCENARIO ANALYSIS<|>EVENT<|>A process used by NATWEST GROUP to evaluate potential future climate-related risks and opportunities, supporting strategic planning and risk mitigation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CREDIT ASSESSMENT<|>EVENT<|>The process of evaluating borrower risk, now incorporating climate-related considerations such as EPC ratings and flood risk assessments to support sustainable lending practices)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLIMATE SCORECARDS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tools used by NATWEST GROUP to quantify and incorporate climate-related risks into credit decisions, enhancing risk management and customer engagement)\n##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
