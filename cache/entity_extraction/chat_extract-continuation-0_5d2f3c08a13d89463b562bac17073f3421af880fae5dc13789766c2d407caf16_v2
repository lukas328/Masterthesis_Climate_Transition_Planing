Beyond the European \nT axonomy, other activities such as the \nextraction of strategic minerals and activities \nrelated to energy efficiency are considered \nunder strict criteria, which can be reviewed \nover a certain time horizon. \nDeclining greenhouse gas emissions \npathways of activities that do not yet \nmeet the technical selection criteria of \nthe European T axonomy, but adhere to \ninternationally recognized frameworks such \nas the Science Based T arget Initiative, where \nthe success of the transition is assessed by \nthe average emissions change over time. \nP.  105\nBBVA Report on TCFD 2022\nThis English version is a translation of the original in Spanish for information purposes only.
