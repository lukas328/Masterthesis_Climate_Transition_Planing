The time horizon \nconsidered was 25-50 years, relevant for the life of capital assets.\nOrbia acknowledges the ever-changing landscape of climate  science and how it influences our business \nstrategies. In order to better assess the challenges ahead of us, we plan to update our previous climate risk \nanalysis during 2022 with state-of-the-art scenarios incorporating new information, expanding our time \nhorizon and scope, beyond Business-As-Usual models, to test and continuously improve our resilience to \nclimate change. \n2.c Orbia’s resilience considering climate-related scenarios\nThe output of this first analysis \nshowed that none of the \nevaluated sites have a high risk \nof being affected by physical \nchanges in climate to 2030.\nIntroduction Governance Strategy Risk Management Metrics and Targets\nOrbia 2021 Climate Report\n19\n \n3\nRisk Management\nIntroduction Governance Strategy Risk Management Metrics and Targets\nOrbia 2021 Climate Report\n20\n3.a Process for identifying and assessing climate-related risks\nOrbia’s risk management process is a systematic approach across Orbia’s corporate and business units. The focus is on \nboth strategic and operational issues, and changes in risk status are promptly communicated to decision makers. Our risk \nprofile, that includes short, medium, and long-term risks, is reviewed every few years. \nIn order to identify and manage all materially relevant risks, Orbia has developed the following structured process:\nRisk identiﬁcation Risk assessment\nRisk oversight \nby Critical\nRisk Committee\nRisk management at\nBusiness Group level\nRisk frameworks & policies approval\nMajor risks are reported to the Audit Committee\nAudit Committee\nBoard of Directors\nRisk monitoring\nSetting direction\nFigure 2. Orbia’s Risk Management Process\nOrbia’s Critical Risk Committee (CRC) oversees four primary risks to the Company: Strategic/Business, Financial, \nOperational, and Reputational. Climate risks have been integrated into these multi-disciplinary company-wide risk \nmanagement processes since 2020.\nThe CRC, chaired by our Chief Executive Officer (CEO), is comprised of our Chief Financial Officer (CFO), General Counsel, \nInternal Audit Vice President (VP), Health, Safety, Environment & Engineering VP, Chief Information Officer, Sustainability \nVP, and Presidents of the five business groups. The CRC meets quarterly and is responsible for identifying and assessing \nenterprise risks (including climate risks), evaluating the appropriate risk profile for the enterprise, developing risk mitigation \nplans, and overseeing their implementation.\nIn addition, the CRC assists the Board of Directors and Audit \nCommittee in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities related to:\nLikelihood and potential impact of material risks are \nidentified and prioritized based on their timeframe and \nrelevance to Orbia’s strategic objectives. The results of \nthese assessments are aggregated to form a Risk Register, \nreviewed and approved by the CRC.\nIn 2019, we also formally identified climate-related risks \nacross the business through a specific climate risk \nassessment aligned with TCFD recommendations. This \nprocess allowed us to assess both physical and transition \nrisks, quantifying their potential financial impact based on \ntheir time horizon, as detailed in section 2.a. We plan to \nupdate our 2019 climate risk analysis in 2022 with refined \nscenarios.\nRisk identification and assessment\nRisk management: exposures and profile\nRisk mitigation: actions and continuous \nmonitoring of mitigation plans\nAssessment and approval of the  \neffectiveness of the three lines of risk \ndefense\nEffective management and assurance of risk \npolicies and strategies\nSetting direction\nIntroduction Governance Strategy Risk Management Metrics and Targets\nOrbia 2021 Climate Report\n21\n3.b Process for managing climate-related risks\nSince 2020, Orbia’s Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) function and business groups have \ndeveloped work streams to integrate climate-related risks alongside other enterprise risks \nand to track the progress of our actions. Risk Registers are managed at business group \nlevel and a mitigation strategy with a specific action plan and risk owner is defined for each \nrisk.\nOrbia’s risk management model establishes three lines of defense that support the risk \nmanagement process (including climate-related aspects). These three lines of defense \ninclude: \nRisk owner at business group level \nresponsible for identifying and controlling \nrisks \nERM & Compliance function at Orbia level \nto ensure communication to relevant \ncommittees \nInternal Audit to improve\ninternal controls\nIn line with Orbia’s risk \nmanagement process, \nmaterial risk developments \nare continuously monitored \nthrough a variety of sources \nat the corporate and business \ngroup level. Changes in \nrisk status are promptly \ncommunicated to decision \nmakers.\nIntroduction Governance Strategy Risk Management Metrics and Targets\nOrbia 2021 Climate Report\n22\n3.c Integration of climate-related risks into overall risk management processes \nOrbia’s ERM program is embedded into the company culture. The CRC’s primary responsibility is to assist the Board of Directors in formulating Orbia’s \nrisk management practices and overseeing their implementation, including climate-related risks. Figure 3 illustrates the interaction between key risk \nmanagement roles: the CRC, the ERM program and the risk owner. \nFigure 3: CRC & ERM Interaction Model\nOversees risk framework\n& risk policies approval\nCritical Risk\nCommittee \nEnterprise Risk\nManagementRisk Owner\nIntegrates risk \nmanagement & controls\nwith Orbia’s goals\nUltimately accountable to\nensure a risk is managed\nand controlled\nAlso, Orbia has engaged with compliance world leader, ENHESA, to identify applicable and \nemerging regulatory requirements stemming from climate change.
