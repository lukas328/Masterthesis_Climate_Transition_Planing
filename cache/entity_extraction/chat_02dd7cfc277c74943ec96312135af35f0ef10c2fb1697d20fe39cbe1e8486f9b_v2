We make up the Carbon Market Squad of the Brazilian Federation \nof Banks (Febraban), the carbon working group of the Brazilian Association of Financial and Capital Markets Entities (ANBIMA) and the \nBrazilian Initiative to the Carbon Voluntary Market to support the development and structuring of this market and increase the Brazilian \ncontribution to the world with high integrity credits.  \nThe carbon market represents an important opportunity to Brazil, which has the potential to generate high integrity credits that help \nachieve our climate targets.  \n41 \nItaú Unibanco Holding S.A.climate report 2022\nOperations: Reduce impacts and create \nopportunities  \nWe started working on climate change in 2008, when \nwe published our first GHG emissions inventory for our \noperations. Since then, we have adopted initiatives focused \non minimizing the climate impact of our own operations and \nthe impact of climate change on our own operations. \nWith respect to eco efficiency, we manage our GHG \nemissions aimed at reducing and aligning them to the Net \nZero strategy. Our inventory follows rigorous procedures \nto be prepared, includes scopes 1, 2 and 3 and is assessed \nby an independent third party expert and certified by the \nNational Institute of Metrology, Quality and Technology \n(INMETRO), which allows us to be granted with the Gold Seal \nrecognition for the program. Since 2018, we use the Climate \nCommitment program to offset our remaining scopes 1 and \n2 emissions and an internal carbon price to support our \nstudies about the voluntary carbon market. Our internal \nprice is based on the average value of each credit purchased, \nwhich was R$27.76 in 2022.\nAimed at reducing our scope 1 emissions, we have set up \ngovernance and action plans focused on measuring and \nreducing our fugitive emissions related to refrigeration, \nwhich account for nearly 90% of our scope1 emissions, by \nretrofitting the refrigeration equipment and using other \nmore efficient technological tools.  We also offset our \nscope 1 emissions in Brazil and LATAM countries (Paraguay, \nArgentina and Uruguay).\nAs for scope 2 emissions, we have invested in the generation \nof clean renewable energy based on distributed generation, \ninvestments in solar panels, and purchases of Renewable \nEnergy Certificates (RECs), neutralizing 100% of our scope \n2 emissions in Brazil. Additionally, our goal is to supply 80% \nof our branch network with renewable energy by 2025,and \nwe keep up our efforts to increase energy efficiency in our \nown operations. To learn more on our eco efficiency strategy, \nincluding our management of water, waste, paper and other \nresources, access our ESG Report.\nThe opportunities in our operations are related to \ninvestments in new technologies to reduce generation \nof emissions and waste, as well as to reduce water and \nenergy consumption, and encourage suppliers to adopt \nBy promoting \necoefficiency  \nin our operational \ninfrastructure, we increase \nour climate resilience, \nreduce climate impacts on \nour operations and create \nopportunities.\nclimate practices more appropriate to the current and \nfuture scenario.\nWe assessed the exposure of our branch network to \nphysical risks from climate change, aimed at identifying \npossible actions to adapt to climate change, and developed \ncontingency plans for water and energy risks.
