Recognising this, we support initiatives \naddressing different challenges and age groups. We spent more than \n£2 million on education and skills development initiatives globally \nin the reporting period, primarily directed at addressing the high \nunemployment and skills deficit that South Africa faces.\nOur focus areas in South Africa remain guided by the \noverlap of our CSI pillars (education, conservation and \ncommunity development) and the regional imperative \nof transformation as expressed in B-BBEE 21 legislation. \nRedSTART\nOur flagship UK education initiative is through our multi-year \npartnership with RedSTART, a UK financial literacy charity focused on \ninstilling better financial habits in young children. Alongside industry \npeers, we co-funded the longitudinal study commissioned by RedSTART \nthat aims to identify the link between financial education at an early \nage and social mobility for London’s most vulnerable. If successful, \nRedSTART will use the results to lobby for financial education to be \nincluded in the primary school curriculum in the UK. \n\nSustainability and Stewardship Report\n73\nAt present, our education and skills development spending in South \nAfrica is largely focused on working with youth after their high school \nyears. That said, we are increasingly working with organisations that are \nbuilding capacity at public high schools, as well as those focusing on \nliteracy and numeracy in under-resourced primary schools. \nChangeblazers\nChangeblazers is our flagship South African education initiative. It now \nsupports more than 100 under-resourced students, allowing them to access \nand thrive at tertiary institutions, and ultimately to go on and add meaningfully \nto the South African economy. \nThe focus is on academic excellence and financial need. The programme \nhas grown from the first cohort of 30 students attending university in 2021, \nto supporting over 100 in 2024. Not only does the programme provide \nmuch-needed funding, it also offers life-skills workshops, access to mental \nhealth professionals and resilience training to assist students in making \nthe transition from home to university and then to the working world. The \nmajority of the beneficiaries are young female students. Qualifications are \nvaried, and include computer science, business and finance, law, psychology, \nengineering and occupational therapy. \nStudents \nqualified for \ngraduation\n10\nChangeblazers 2023 performance\nStudents on \nDean's list \n(>75%)\n22\nStudents \nachieved \n70-75%\n25\nAcademic \naverage of all \nstudents\n69%\nSustainability and Stewardship Report\n74\nWe are incredibly proud to have our first 10 graduates from our 2021 cohort. \nThey include:\nOur top graduates\nEden Jaftha \nBCom Accounting\nEllah Ngcukana \nBCom (General)\nSamantha Hammond \nBSocSci Psychology\nSanele Zulu \nBAcc Science\nOnalenna Mofokeng \nBA Psychology\nSummer Martin \nBSocSci Psychology\nLenox Baloyi\nBSc in Mathematics of Finance\nReynhardt Buys\nBCom Actuarial Science\nClement Ledwaba\nBSc Computer Science\nCharné Scholtz\nBCom Investment Management\n\nSustainability and Stewardship Report\n75\n Junior Achievement South Africa\nThrough our partnership with Entrepreneurship Development Trust, we have \nfunded various entrepreneurship programmes across South Africa. This includes \nthe further rolling out of an enterprise programme run by Junior Achievement \nSouth Africa. The programme takes 16-18 year old learners through nine months \nof training and coaching on entrepreneurship – from ideation to sales and \ndistribution. Themed ‘Breaking Barriers’, the 2023 South African Company of the \nYear competition brought together 15 young learners representing their region to \nshowcase their businesses and demonstrate their teamwork, innovation, problem-\nsolving and leadership skills. National winners Unwind (see picture below) were \nfrom a Cape Town-based school where the programme was made possible by \nEntrepreneurship Development Trust and Ninety One. The learners went on to win \nthird place in the regional finals in Ghana in December 2023. \n\nSustainability and Stewardship Report\nConservation\nWe are the founding sponsor of the Tusk Conservation Awards \nand have expanded our support of Tusk’s work through the recent \nlaunch of a charitable share class in one of our sustainable strategies. \nThe annual management fee from the money invested in the share \nclass will be donated to Tusk on an ongoing basis. These annual \ndonations will be made available to help the ranger community, \nespecially families of rangers who have laid down their lives, and to \nsupport rangers’ conservation efforts. \nWe also provided support to Conservation South Africa to expand \nits work with farmers and communities to embrace climate change-\nresilient farming practices.\nCommunity development\nCommunity development initiatives can be separated into two types of support:\n1\nInfrastructure as an enabler of \nsocio-economic development \nthrough driving better education \nand health outcomes.\n2\nSupport of community-based \norganisations as an accelerator, \nwhich is targeted to the specific \nneeds of identified beneficiaries.\nWater infrastructure\nOur collaboration with Entrepreneurship Development Trust \nexpanded our support of water projects. We committed \nto funding a solar-powered borehole in Goqeyane Village \nin KwaZulu Natal. There are more than 4,500 people in the \ncommunity who will have easier, and more sustainable access \nto clean water when the project is completed. The terrain \nin the village makes it a difficult area to undertake such a \nproject.
