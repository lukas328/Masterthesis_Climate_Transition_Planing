It is enhancing the ways we can feed ethics and compliance data back \nto the business and giving us valuable oversight over our operations.\nThe heatmap focuses on essential ethical culture indicators. Our leaders can see how \neach of our larger facilities is currently performing and address weaker metrics, \nsuggestive of potential ethical culture issues, more proactively.\nThe heatmap has been recognised by the wider business community. The Institute \nof Business Ethics used it as an example of what good looks like in a recent report \non ethical culture.\nSupporting our suppliers to improve their  \nESG performance \nWe have been supporting one of our \nstrategic suppliers, who is located in a \nhigher risk region, and did not have any \nprevious engagement with EcoVadis or \nother sustainability ratings agencies. As \npart of our supplier partnering \nprogramme, the supplier decided to join \nEcoVadis at their own cost and \ncompleted the assessment. The outcome \nwas a score two points lower than the \nindustry average. We are now supporting \nthe supplier in the development of their \npolicies and processes with an aim to \nsignificantly increase their score and \nachieve an EcoVadis silver medal. We \nhave quarterly reviews with the supplier \nto monitor their progress. This is a \ndemonstration of how we can partner \nwith suppliers to improve sustainability \nand drive improvements in our wider \nvalue chain. \nPeople: Promoting a safe, diverse and equitable society continued\nreal-life conversations about what doing the right thing means for employees in their roles. \nIn addition to Ethics Week, we launched monthly communications to highlight the \nimportance of ethics and integrity in our everyday work. \nIn line with our strategy we refreshed our annual Code of Ethics training to focus on our \nvalues, ethical decision making and scenarios that are applicable to all employees. It has been \noffered to 11,100 employees1 and contractors during the year and 87% have completed it. \nWe received positive feedback from our employees.  \nWe also run targeted training courses for our relevant managers and externally facing \nemployees in competition law and our anti-bribery and corruption policies.\nResponsible sourcing \nWe are a multinational company with a global, multi-tiered supply chain. We rely on \nour suppliers to provide raw materials as well as goods and services ranging from equipment \nto utilities and transport. Every year we work with thousands of suppliers and in 2022/23 \nwe spent £3 billion with them (excl PGMs). We increased the ways we support our \nsuppliers globally. \nAs a values-driven organisation, we work closely with our value chain to uphold human rights \nand maintain the highest standards in procurement. \nOur Supplier Code of Conduct sets out our expectations, and is embedded into our New \nSupplier Selection Process. All new suppliers complete a self-assessment as part of our \non-boarding process. Our most important existing suppliers are assessed annually against \nour Supplier Code of Conduct using the services of sustainability rating provider EcoVadis. \nDuring this year, suppliers accounting for 48% spend (excluding PGMs) in our portfolio have \nbeen assessed through EcoVadis, and we plan to increase this further in the coming year. \nIn addition to that, we started to monitor specific KPIs in EcoVadis that help us to better \nunderstand our supplier’s performance in human rights and health and safety as well as their \njourney to net zero.
