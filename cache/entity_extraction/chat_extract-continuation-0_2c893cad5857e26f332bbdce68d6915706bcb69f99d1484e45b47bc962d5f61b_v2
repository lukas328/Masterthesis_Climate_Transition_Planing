This included \nguiding Milliman towards the SBTi framework \nand explaining how it could support Milliman \ndefine its own net zero targets in line with \nclimate science.\nA critical part of our engagement with \nMilliman was to have our executive team \ncommunicate with Milliman’s leadership team \nto assist them in their strategic conversations. \nWe helped them secure a more ambitious \nlong-term commitment than the original \nproposal, with a motion of net zero by 2040 \nwith SBTi.\n“Our historical and close collaboration with \nPhoenix has proved hugely beneficial both in \nterms of identifying mutual opportunities for \nimprovement in terms of social impact and \nsustainability, and ensuring that we were able \nto secure ambitious commitments to \nmeaningful climate action with our senior \nleadership team.
