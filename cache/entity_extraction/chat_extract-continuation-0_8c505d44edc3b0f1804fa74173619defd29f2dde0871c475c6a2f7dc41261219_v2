Supervision of an external \nworker is day-to-day working directions.  \n‘Of which Lost Time injuries’: The lost time injuries are based on \nincidents reported in Vestas' reporting system, with more than \none day of absence from work, including externally employed \nworkers under Vestas' supervision. \n‘Of which fatal injuries’: The fatal injuries are based on \nincidents reported in Vestas’ reporting system, including \nexternally employed workers under Vestas’ supervision.\nT otal Recordable Injuries per million working hours (number) \nT otal Recordable Injury Rate (TRIR) represents all injuries \nreported in the Vestas reporting system per one million \nfactors for Indirect emissions from the supply chain (2011). \nFuel- and energy-related activities are calculated using BEIS \nfactors for emissions related to the production of fuel and \nNREL factors for renewable energy. \nTransportation: Emissions from upstream transportation \n(category 4) are based on supplier information and estimated \nbased on the LCA reports for weight and distance of \ncomponents transported and BEIS (2022) carbon emissions \nfactors. Business travel (category 6) emissions for air flights \nare activity-based data provided by the travel agency used for \nall bookings. Employee commuting (category 7) is reported on \ndaily commute by car, which is estimated based on the average \nnumber of FTEs and a selected sample of commuting distance. \nIt applies standard factors published by the BEIS (2022). \nEnd-of-life treatment: Of sold products (category 12) is \nestimated based on material composition of all produced and \nshipped wind turbines in the reporting year. For materials that \nare not recyclable, an average GaBi (2022) emission factor for \ninert landfill is applied. \nIndirect emissions of CO2e from the supply chain (scope 3) \n(kg CO2e per MWh generated) \nThe amount of MWh generated is based on the number and \ntype of wind turbines produced and shipped in the financial \nyear along with values for wind turbine capacity factor and \nsite-specific lifetime. In relation to the target to reduce carbon \nemissions in the value chain, indirect emissions of CO2e from \nthe value chain per MWh generated include 70 percent of the \nscope 3 emissions.\nProducts\nCO2e avoided is to be understood as the volume of emissions \navoided by using the wind turbines as an electricity source, \ncompared to the latest updated IEA World average level of \nCO2e impact involved in electricity generation. \nExpected CO2e avoided over the lifetime of the capacity \nproduced and shipped during the period (million tonnes)\nThis is based on total wind turbines (MW) produced and \nshipped during the reporting period. A weighted average \ncapacity factor was applied in 2022, based on actual hourly \nof women among the members of the Executive  \nManagement combined.\n Women in leadership positions at the end of the period (%)\nThe share of women in leadership positions is calculated \nbased on headcounts at the end of the reporting period. The \nparameter is calculated based on the number of women in \nleadership positions divided by the total number of leadership \npositions. Employee information is from the company’s \nordinary registration systems with specification of gender and \nmanagement level. Leadership positions comprise managers, \nspecialists, project managers, and above.\nHuman rights\nCommunity grievances (number)\nThe number of community grievances is calculated based \non incidents registered in the reporting system. The \nmeasure “Community grievances” covers the total number of \ncommunity complaints registered in the reporting system in \nthe reporting year. Vestas registers and handles community \nincidents caused by Vestas or its contractors on communities \nthat turn into a grievance, where a “community” is a person or \ngroup that is either directly or indirectly affected by Vestas or \nVestas' activities. The cases occur in connection with a wind \nfarm project and its associated facilities (e.g. accommodation \nfacilities), a Vestas factory or a Vestas Research and \nDevelopment Centre.\nCommunity beneficiaries (number)\nCommunity beneficiaries are defined as individuals that have \nbenefitted by participating in Vestas’ community development \ninitiatives intended to upgrade skills or by receiving financial \nor equivalent aid. \nThese initiatives are implemented during the reporting period \nin connection to a wind farm project and associated facilities, a \nVestas factory, or Vestas Research and Development Centre. \nCommunity development initiatives are identified in \ncollaboration with local stakeholders, such as local authorities \nand members of the local community to ensure that the \ninitiatives meet local needs. \n84\nVestas Sustainability Report 2022\nSustainability data\nVestas Sustainability Report 2022\n84\nIn brief General GovernanceEnvironment Social Appendix\nThis indicator only includes defined community members \nthat benefit directly.
