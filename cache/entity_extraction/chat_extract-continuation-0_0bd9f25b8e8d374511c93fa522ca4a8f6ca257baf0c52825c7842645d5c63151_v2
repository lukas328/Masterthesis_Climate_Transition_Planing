The \nestimates take account of the inherent uncertainties, constraining the expected level of profit \nas appropriate. Changes in these estimates will affect future profits and therefore the \nrecoverability of the deferred tax assets. \nRefining process and stocktakes \nThe group’s and parent company’s refining businesses process significant quantities of \nprecious metal and there are uncertainties regarding the actual amount of metal in the \nrefining system at any one time. The group’s refining businesses process over four million \nounces of platinum group metals per annum with a market value of around £6 billion. The \nmajority of metal processed is owned by customers and the group and parent company must \nreturn pre-agreed quantities of refined metal based on assays of starting materials and other \ncontractual arrangements, such as the timing of the return of metal. The group and parent \ncompany calculate the profits or losses of their refining operations based on estimates, \nincluding the extent to which process losses are expected during refining. The risk of \nprocess losses or stock take gains depends on the nature of the starting material being \nrefined, the specific refining processes applied, the efficiency of those processes and the \ncontractual arrangements.  \nStocktakes are performed to determine the volume and value of metal within the refining \nsystem compared with the calculated estimates, with the variance being a profit or a loss. \nStocktakes are, therefore, a key control in the assessment of the accuracy of the profit or loss \nof refining operations. Whilst refining is a complex, large-scale industrial process, the group \nand parent company have appropriate processes and controls over the movement of material \nin their refineries. \nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 2023156\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION\nNotes on the Accounts continued for the year ended 31st March 2023 \n156 \n1 Accounting policies continued \nSources of estimation uncertainty \nDetermining the carrying amounts of certain assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date \nrequires estimation of the effects of uncertain future events. In the event that actual outcomes \ndiffer from those estimated, there may be an adjustment to the carrying amounts of those \nassets and liabilities within the next financial year. Other significant risks of material \nadjustment are the valuation of the liabilities of the defined benefit pension plans and tax \nprovisions. The group and parent company have considered the refining process and \nstocktakes, deferred tax assets and climate change and, whilst not deemed to represent a \nsignificant risk of material adjustment to the group’s and parent company’s financial position \nduring the year ending 31st March 2023, represent important accounting estimates. \nGoodwill, other intangibles and other assets \nThe group and parent company have significant intangible assets from both business \nacquisitions and investments in new products and technologies. Some of those acquisitions \nand investments are at an early stage of commercial development and, therefore, carry a \ngreater risk that they will not be commercially viable. Goodwill and intangible assets not yet \nready for use are not amortised, but are subject to annual impairment reviews. Other \nintangible assets are amortised from the time they are first ready for use and, together with \nother assets, are assessed for impairment when there is a triggering event that provides \nevidence that they are impaired. \nThe impairment reviews require the use of estimates of future profit and cash generation \nbased on financial budgets and plans approved by management, generally covering a three-\nyear period and then extrapolated using long term growth rates, and the pre-tax discount \nrates used in discounting projected cash flows, see note 5. \nPost-employment benefits \nThe group’s and parent company’s defined benefit plans are assessed annually by qualified \nindependent actuaries. The estimate of the liabilities of the plans is based on a number of \nactuarial assumptions. \nThere is a range of possible values for each actuarial assumption and the point within that \nrange is estimated to most appropriately reflect the group’s and parent company’s \ncircumstances. Small changes in these assumptions can have a significant impact on the \nestimate of the liabilities of the plans. A description of those discount rate and inflation \nassumptions, together with sensitivity analysis, is set out in note 24 to the group and parent \ncompany accounts. \nTax provisions \nTax provisions are determined based on the tax laws and regulations that apply in each of the \njurisdictions in which the group operates. Tax provisions are recognised where the impact of \nthose laws and regulations is unclear and it is probable that there will be a tax adjustment \nrepresenting a future outflow of funds to a tax authority or a consequent adjustment to the \ncarrying value of a tax asset. \nProvisions are measured using the best estimate of the most likely amount, being the most \nlikely amount in a range of possible outcomes. The resolution of tax positions taken by the \ngroup can take a considerable period of time to conclude and, in some cases, it is difficult to \npredict the outcome.
