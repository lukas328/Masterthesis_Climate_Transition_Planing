To oversee the working groups, we have also launched the \nClimate Change Response Taskforce.

Matters that require decision-making will be \nsettled at committee meetings as necessary. \n \n \n3. Corporate officer remuneration \nAs per Mizuho group’ s corporate vision, and based on the basic management policy, we aim to realize management that \ncontributes to the creation of value for various stakeholders and improve corporate value through sustainable, stable growth for \nthe Mizuho group. In order to do this, officers receive remuneration, which is equivalent in value to the responsibilities they carry \nand the results they produce, while simultaneously functioning as an incentive for each officer to fulfill their role to the best of their \nability. \n \nAt Miz uho, we have positioned addressing climate change as a key part of our corporate strategy. For corporate officer \nremuneration, sustainability initiatives (including initiatives addressing climate change) that leverage evaluations compar ing \nresults from previous fiscal years and other companies, and that are conducted by the four main ESG evaluation agencies,8 are \none of the factors that decide performance-based compensation (variable compensation). \n \n \n \n \n \n                                         \n8 Four main ESG evaluation agencies: S&P Dow Jones, Sustainalytics, MSCI, FTSE. \nPresident & Group \nCEO (GCEO)\nClimate Change Response \nTaskforce\n5 working groups\nManagement and \nreduction of Scope 1 \nand 2 emissions\nResponse to climate-\nrelated disclosure \nregulations\nPromotion of \ndecarbonization\nsupport business\nMeasurement of Scope \n3 emissions and target \nsetting\nBusiness execution\nExecutive Management \nCommittee\nRisk Management \nCommittee\nSustainability Promotion \nCommittee\nNewly established\nClimate-related risk \nmanagement / \nscenario analysis\nCEO message\nOverview/Introduction\nGovernance\nStrategy\nRisk management\nMetrics and targets\nConclusion\nAppendix\n \n-20- Mizuho Financial Group \n \n \nFigure 4: Corporate officer remuneration system \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nBase Salary\n(Paid monthly)\nStock \nCompensation I\n(Paid monthly\nPaid upon \nretirement)\nPerformance \nPayments\nStock \nCompensation \nII\nAccording to the functions and responsibilities of each of the Officers.\nAccording to the functions and responsibilities of each of the Officers.\nDeferred \npayment \nover three \nyears for \nthe portion \nabove a \ncertain \namount\nDeferred \npayments \nover three \nyears\nFixed compensationVariable compensation*1\nType of \ncompensation Composition of compensation\n100％\n85.0％\n15.0％\nStock\nFixed compensation only\nGroup CEO\n50.0％\n50.0％\n42.5％\n7.5％\n25.0％\n25.0％\nStock\nRatio of \nStock \nCompen‐\nsation\n32.5％\nExample of composition of compensation\n62.5％\n37.5％\n57.5％\n5.0％\n15.0％\n22.5％\nGroup executive \nofficers\nStock\nRatio of \nStock \nCompen‐\nsation\n20.0％\nRatio of variable compensation/ \nstock compensation\nHighLow\nNon-executive \nofficers \nresponsible for \nmanagement \nsupervision\n40％\n10％Net Income Attributable to FG \n10％Consolidated ROE\n30％\nQuantitative\n70％\nQualitative\n30％\nSubject to malusand clawback\n2 Profit Attributable to Owners of Parent\n10％Expense Ratio\nConsolidated Net Business Profits + Net Gains (Losses) \nrelated to ETFs and others\nEvaluation from the perspective of increasing \ncorporate value through sustainable and stable \ngrowth of the Group\nGross profits RORA, CET1 ratio, reduction of cross-\nshareholding, TSR, quality of profits Customer \nsatisfaction, employee’s engagement, and \nsustainability initiatives\nResults of organization assigned for each Officers are also reflected, \nexcluding Group CEO\n1 Amount of compensation is determined by the Compensation Committee for each fiscal year. \n“Standard Amount” x “Corporate performance linked coefficient”\nVariable compensation (0-150%)1\nPerformance-based compensation is determined by multiplying the base amount (decided based on the role and \nresponsibilities of each corporate officer) by the performance-based attribution factor (calculated from both quantitative and \nqualitative data). \n \nQuantitative evaluation \nThe evaluation is based on the target achievement rates for Consolidated Net Business Profits + Net Gains/Losses \nRelated to ETFs and Others (which indicates the profitability of our core business), the Profit Attributable to Owners of \nParent (which is the final result of business operations), and the Consolidated ROE and the Expense Ratio (which indicate \noperations efficiency).
