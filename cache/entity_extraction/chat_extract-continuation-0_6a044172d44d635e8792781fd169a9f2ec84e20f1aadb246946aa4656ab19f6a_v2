The estimated cost of claims expected to rebound after the reporting date \nhas been calculated as a proportion (the deferral factor) of the observed shortfall in incurred claims, compared with \npre-COVID-19 expectations. This has been recognised on a best estimate basis, together with an allowance for claims \nhandling costs and an additional risk margin. \nSources of estimation uncertainty \nThe key assumptions used in the calculation of the outstanding claims provision include claims development, margin of \nprudence, claims costs inflation, medical trends and seasonality. In respect of the deferred claim provision, significant \nassumptions include forecasting the insurance claims that remain deferred at the reporting date following periods of \nsignificant COVID-19 disruption and the percentage of those claims which are likely to rebound in the future. \nThe unearned premium provision includes a return of premium provision in respect of the UK Private Medical Insurance \n(PMI) business. In April 2020, Bupa Insurance Limited made a commitment to pass back to customers any exceptional \nfinancial benefits experienced by the UK PMI business that ultimately arise as a result of COVID-19. The provision has \nbeen calculated based on estimating the ultimate net reduction in claims costs attributable to COVID-19, adjusted to \ntake into account incremental costs and profit impacts attributable to COVID-19, and deducting the estimated costs of \ndeferred claims expected to rebound and COVID-19 related claims inflation. \nSources of estimation uncertainty \nSignificant assumptions for the return of premium provision include forecasting the insurance claims that remain \ndeferred at the reporting date following COVID-19 disruption, including the timing and amount of claims that are \nexpected to rebound, and in calculating the exceptional financial benefits that are expected to be experienced by the \nbusiness, including the identification of incremental costs and profit impacts attributable to COVID-19. \nThe Group has circumstances arising over the ordinary course of business, including losses which might arise from \nlitigation, disputes, and interpretation of tax law or local regulations. Judgement is exercised in determining whether \nthe circumstances should give rise to the recognition of provisions or contingent liabilities. In the case of material \ncontingent liabilities further judgment is required in arriving at appropriate disclosure of such matters. \nAccounting judgement \nSignificant judgment has been applied in assessing the contingent liability that has arisen in Chile as a result of the \nruling issued by the Supreme Court in Chile that obliges Isapres to make use of a specific table of risk factors. As the \nrelevant regulator, the Chilean Superintendent of Health has six months to apply the ruling there is currently significant \nuncertainty as to what the impacts could be on the business. \n19 \n19 \n28 \nBupa Annual Report 2022 127 \n    \n                 \n                \n                   \n              \n             \n                 \n                  \n                \n               \n                \n              \n                 \n                \n                 \n                  \n                  \n               \n                 \n             \n  \n                \n                   \n                   \n               \n        \n                  \n      \n          \n             \n                \n                    \n                 \n                  \n        \n                     \n                    \n                   \n                 \n                  \n      \n                 \n                \n                    \n                     \n                  \n                \n              \n               \n                   \n  \n          \n      \n   \nStrategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements \nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \ncontinued \n1.4 Going concern \nFollowing a detailed assessment of the Group’s going concern status based on its current position and forecast \nresults, along with scenario-based stress testing and reverse stress testing, the Directors have concluded that the \nGroup has adequate resources to operate for at least the next 12 months from the approval of these financial \nstatements. This assessment considered forecast and reasonably possible adverse changes to the Group’s liquidity, \nregulatory solvency, access to funding and trading profitability over the next 12 months. \nThe assessment identified the risks and uncertainties most likely to impact the Group and considered the impact \non the Group’s businesses under a number of reasonably plausible severe scenarios as well as consideration of \ncontingent liabilities. This included a broad range of potential adverse outcomes from the Chile Supreme Court \njudgment described in Note 28, including scenarios that considered materially worse outcomes than the Solvency \nII capital allocated against the contingency given the inherent uncertainty surrounding the implementation of the \nSupreme Court judgement. Other scenarios considered included a worsening of the global inflationary outlook \ndriven by strong wage inflation leading to a wage-price inflation spiral and subsequent recession, and a variety \nof local scenarios developed by each business unit with the majority focusing on strategic workforce-related \nrisks impacting either the availability or cost of staff. Under each such scenario, significant short-term reductions \nin profitability arise, however the Group would still remain within its risk appetites for liquidity and regulatory \nsolvency. Additionally, the Group has access to a £900m revolving credit facility (RCF) as described in Note 17(c). \nThe Group expects to remain compliant with the RCF’s covenants under stressed scenarios and may further \ndraw down on the RCF in order to meet liquidity needs. Additional management actions would allow downside \nimpacts to be further mitigated by reducing expenditure, obtaining additional funding or divesting investments \nor businesses. \nDetails of the
