We \nare proud to share the actions we are taking \nto ensure we go beyond delivering against \nour targets, in what the United Nations has \ndeclared the critical ‘Decade of Action’.\nContext  03\nOur Progress 04\nOur Journey to Net Zero 05\nOur Commitment 06\nOur Approach 07\nMeasuring Performance 17\nSupporting Documents 18\nGlossary 18\nContext\nDiageo fully supports the Paris Agreement, \nthe COP 26 Glasgow Climate Pact and \nwe are a proud signatories to the Business \nAmbition for limiting global warming to 1.5°C \nabove pre-industrial levels and the High \nLevel Climate Champions Race to Resilience. \nEnsuring we meet this pathway is vital for \nmitigating our impact \nand reducing the damaging changes \nto people and our planet, that climate \nchange can bring.\nOur approach to achieving our ambitious \nemission reduction targets, as set out in this \nstrategy, highlights our commitment to acting \nwith urgency and decisiveness. Core to our \nstrategy is prioritising direct action to reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions and getting as \nclose to absolute zero as possible, only \nneutralising residual emissions.\nAccelerating to a low carbon world is part \nof Society 2030: Spirt of Progress - our 10-\nyear ESG action plan for creating a more \ninclusive and sustainable world. Society 2030 \nencompasses our goal to mitigate and adapt \nto climate change through our commitment \nto pioneer ‘Grain to Glass’ sustainability. \nIn the communities where we live, work, \nsource and sell we are committed to \nsupporting a just transition, underpinned by \nour inclusivity & diversity goals, to ensure \nwe improve human and social capital whilst \nmeeting our decarbonisation goals.\nOur emission reduction strategy recognises \nthe inherent linkages between moving \nto a low carbon world and our other priorities \nsuch as protecting water resources, enhancing \nbiodiversity and driving innovation throughout \nour supply chain to reduce emissions and our \nreliance on the earth’s finite resources. \nWe acknowledge that this net zero strategy \nsupports a wider business approach \nto managing climate impacts. By prioritising \nboth mitigation (reducing our contribution \nto climate change) and adaptation \n(proactively responding to a changing climate \nand its impact on our business and the \nfarming communities we depend on for our \nraw materials and ingredients), we aim to find \na resilient and equitable pathway \nto a low carbon world. Reporting our climate \nrelated progress publicly every year against \nrecognized frameworks such as CDP and \nTCFD demonstrates our ongoing commitment.\nWe have taken steps over many years \nto understand and address climate change \nimpacts through our work on championing \nsustainability. Our approach to becoming \na more sustainable business is framed by \nthe UN Sustainable Development Goals, \nwith Goal 7 ‘Affordable and Clean Energy’, \nand Goal 13 ‘Climate Action’ being \na particular focus area for accelerate \nto a low carbon world.\n3\nAccelerating to a\nLow Carbon World\nThe global climate is already changing, with governments \nand scientists across the world declaring that humanity           \nis in a climate emergency.
