globeï¿½\nVestas is a key player in the global energy transition and participates \nin energy debates at international, national, and local levels ï¿½ We seek \nto engage with governments and public stakeholders to promote \nour interests in energy and renewables in a legal, ethical, and \ntransparent manner ï¿½ This can involve direct advocacy with govern -\nments, information campaigns, meetings with officials and poliâ \nticians on issues linked to wind energy, and indirect lobbying through \nassociations ï¿½ Our objective is to accelerate the clean energy tranâ \nsition in line with the objective of the Paris Agreement to limit global \nwarming to 1ï¿½ 5 degrees C, and to increase the contribution wind \nenergy makes towards achieving this objective across the globe ï¿½
