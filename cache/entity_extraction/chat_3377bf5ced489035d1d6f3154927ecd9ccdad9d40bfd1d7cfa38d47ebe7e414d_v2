It therefore excludes upstream and downstream emissions from our value chain.\n(6) Market-based Scope 2 emissions. We have procured 100% of UK and Republic of Ireland and 98% globally from renewable sources using green tariffs and renewable electricity certificates. The 13 tCO2e arises from district cooling and district heating, which is used at only a few sites.\n(*) Within the scope of EY assurance (2022 only). Refer to page 10.\nEmissions methodology and basis of preparation\nBoundary: this statement has been prepared in accordance with our regulatory obligation to report greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions pursuant to the Companies (Directors’ Report) and Limited Liability Partnerships (Energy and Carbon \nReport) Regulations 2018 which implement the government’s policy on Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting. Our reporting year runs from the 1st of October 2021 to the 30th of September 2022. The emissions reporting boundary is \ndefined as all entities and facilities either owned or under our operational control.\nCalculation: emissions have been calculated using the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Standard and associated guidance and include all greenhouse gases, reported in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) and global \nwarming potential values. When converting data to carbon emissions, we use Emission Factors from UK Government Emissions Conversion Factors for Company Reporting (Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy, 2021, \nCO2 emissions from fuel combustion (International Energy Agency, 2021) or relevant local authorities as required. NatWest Group uses a third-party software system, to capture and record our environmental impact and ensure that \ncontrol framework and assurance requirements are met. All data is aggregated at a regional level to reflect the total regional consumption. The regional consumption results are then collated to reflect the total NatWest Group footprint. \nCO2e values are attributed to these sources via an automatic conversion module in the third-party system. For more information, please see the own operational footprint page at natwestgroup.com.\nNatWest Group’s own operational footprint continued\n75NatWest Group plc | 2022 Climate-related Disclosures Report\nGovernance Strategy and Climate transition plan Risk Management and Scenario Analysis Metrics and TargetsIntroduction\nNatWest Group’s own operational footprint continued\nOther Own Operational Initiatives \nCarbon Credits: in 2020 we set an ambition to procure 120,000 tCO2e each year in carbon removal credits up to \n2025. In 2022 we retired 120,000 tCO2e carbon removal credits, assured under the Verified Carbon Standard \n(VCS), and Triple Gold certified to the Climate, Community & Biodiversity Alliance Standards (CCBA) to invest \nbeyond our value chain, and provide benefits to climate, especially those that generate additional co-benefits for \npeople and nature. We intend to continue to mitigate our emissions beyond the value chain in line with SBTi \nrecommendations. We recognise the importance of ensuring the integrity of natural capital and we screen \nnature-based carbon credits against established methodologies that offer leading additional environmental and \nsocial co-benefits\nNature: Using equipment funded by NatWest Group, the Wild Carbon Fund with the University of the West of \nEngland have begun research into the soil health of naturally regenerated woodlands in Cambridgeshire. The aim \nof the research is to develop a methodology that will allow the benefits of soil health and re-wilding to be measured \nand included in future carbon credit markets. Further, NatWest has partnered with Revere, a collaboration between \nNational Parks and Palladium that aims to restore the UK’s best-loved protected landscapes. Large scale nature \nrestoration projects will contribute to the collective strategy of NatWest and UK National Parks in the fight against \nclimate change and biodiversity loss. For further detail on Nature, refer to our 2022 ESG Disclosures Report.\nInternal Carbon Pricing: we are looking at options to calculate an internal price on carbon for our own operations \nand plan on trialling an approach to help drive sustainable decision-making.\nTechnology: a climate dashboard was created in 2022 to allow users to see the emissions for each server, \napplication and domain and drill down into the detail available. This tool will assist with tracking progress of the \nreduction of our emissions and power utilisation across the group.\nDesign: we have a continued focus on delivering sustainable quality assured fit-outs across all of our buildings, \nusing SKA ratings to assess fit-out projects against a set of sustainability criteria. In 2022, we achieved a silver SKA \nrating for an additional three branches and one office. By achieving silver, we are demonstrating sustainable \nworkplace design and implementation. As part of our commitment to ensure responsible design of our buildings, we \nare trialling a carbon calculator specifically to understand and review our impact.\nInnovation: in 2022 we trialled remote fixes to our ATMs in our hardest-to-reach branches via augmented reality, \nallowing our engineers to\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
