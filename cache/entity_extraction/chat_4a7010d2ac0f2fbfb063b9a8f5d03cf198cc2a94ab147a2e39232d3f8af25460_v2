unpredictable events; \nwar in Europe, widespread inflation and interest rate \nrises and political change in many countries. The \ncontext in which Bupa has operated this year has \nundoubtedly been challenging – and we should not \nforget that COVID-19 has continued to be a factor \nin a number of countries. \nAgainst this backdrop, however, the Bupa Board and I \nare proud of how Bupa has navigated these events. We \nare pleased with underlying performance this year and \nhow Bupa has performed in line with our expectations. \nAlthough the statutory loss is disappointing, as Inaki \ndescribes in his CEO Review, the impairments in some \nbusinesses relate to a complex set of largely macro-\neconomic, sectoral and operational factors that \nmanagement are navigating with the Board’s support. \nIt’s particularly satisfying to see significant and \nmeaningful progress being made with the 3x6 strategy \nthat Iñaki and his leadership team launched in 2021, and \nthis progress gives the Board confidence in the future. \nIn what has been Bupa’s 75th anniversary year, I want \nto acknowledge the hard work and commitment of our \npeople in serving and caring for our customers, patients \nand residents – and this is demonstrated in the great \nprogress made throughout the year. What has struck \nme already is the way the new 3x6 strategy is being \nreceived. People are hugely energised by the sense of \nambition at the heart of it. What has been so impressive \nis that Bupa’s people across the world have continued \nto embrace the ethos of simultaneously “running” and \n“changing” Bupa. \nAs the 3x6 strategy is implemented, three particular \nhighlights stand out to me. \nAs customers across the world manage the rising \ncost of living, it is critical that Bupa continues to deliver \nhigh-quality, accessible healthcare and value for money. \nBupa's focus on continuous improvement is evident in \nthe scale and breadth of the progress with customer \nimprovements through the year across all of our \nbusinesses. This focus is key to Bupa achieving the \nambition we have set of being the world’s most \ncustomer-centric healthcare company. \nOur people are vital to delivering great customer \nservice and care as well as implementing change and \nso we were delighted to see the highest ever levels of \nengagement from our people in Bupa’s global People \nPulse survey. It is critical that we maintain and improve \nthis engagement as Bupa goes through significant \ntransformation, and the Board and I support the range \nof initiatives taken to enhance pay and health and \nwellbeing support to help our people. \nWe’re also realising the benefits of the strategy, \nwith significant organic growth in customer numbers \nacross several markets – both in health insurance and \nprovision. This demonstrates how we are meeting \nrapidly increasing customer demand for healthcare, \nparticularly for services which are delivered digitally. \nThe world is in an ongoing period of change as we \nemerge from the pandemic and the geopolitical \ninstability caused by the war in Ukraine. \nI wanted to highlight, in particular, the amazing work \nthat our LUX MED team in Poland are doing to support \nrefugees who have been fleeing the war in Ukraine. I \nwas privileged to visit the team recently with Iñaki and \nsome of the Chief Executive Committee and saw at first \nhand the amazing job LUX MED is doing. We’re clear \nthat we will continue to fund this support for as long \nas needed. \nIn last year’s Chairman’s statement, I noted Bupa’s \nparticular focus on sustainability in the new strategy. \nIn 2022, we launched a new sustainability strategy \nthrough which Bupa will deliver the commitment to \n“make a better world” which we added to our purpose\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
