continuously improving \nour fleet; optimizing our transport network; continuing to minimise our waste; and electrifying our warehouse estate whilst \nsourcing renewable energy.\nWe plan to continue to reduce our emissions through our continuous improvement and operational excellence programmes \nand are confident that we will meet our targets, both interim and long term, whilst collaboratively helping our customers to \nachieve theirs.\nCarbon reduction plan - July 2023\nBaseline emissions footprint\nBaseline emissions\nBaseline emissions are a record of the greenhouse gases that have been produced in the past and were produced prior to the \nintroduction or continuation of any strategies documented below to reduce emissions. Our baseline emissions are the reference \npoint against which our future emissions reduction will be measured.\nThe Wincanton financial year is 1 April to 31 March. Our current targets are our third carbon target period. We started with “10% \nreduction by 2016 from a 2010 baseline”, which we achieved. We then completed “a 5% reduction by 2020 from a 2016 baseline” \nand have now set a long-term target to 2040 based around our net-zero aspirations.\nThe baseline for this third “net-zero” target period is 2019-20, “FY2020”.\nAdditional details relating to the baseline emissions calculations\nOur carbon emission information is prepared with reference to the Carbon Disclosure Standards Board (CDSB) Framework 1.1 and \nthe GHG Protocol Corporate Standard for company reporting using ‘operational control’.\nCarbon factors are as per UK Defra/BEIS conversion factors for company reporting for the respective years, with emissions from \nelectricity generation, transmission and distribution emissions included as scope 2 emissions. For all UK mainland operations \nwhere we have the supply contract, we purchase ‘green tariff’ electricity that complies with the market-based scope 2 reporting \nrequirements of the GHG protocol. However, we have reported electricity use at UK grid average emissions for the purposes of \nthis Carbon Reduction Plan and our Annual Report(s), both of which are available on the Wincanton website along with an ESG \nreporting page referencing the relevant GRI measures.\nThis baseline footprint is the same as that published in Wincanton Annual Report 2020 (AR20), restated in AR21 and restated here \nto reflect the disposal in Sep/Oct 2020 of our containers and workshop businesses. The AR21 and post disposal restatements have \nbeen provided with the post disposal figure being the baseline we will work from. Wincanton acquired Cygnia in September 2021, \nadding 428 tCO2e from the use of mains gas and electricity. Cygnia customers outsource their transport meaning no scope 1 or 3 \nemissions from transport. This carbon figure was about 0.1% of our total scope 1 and 2 emissions and deemed not material to our \nemissions. No ‘re-baselining’ of our target or performance figures was therefore required for the Cygnia acquisition.\nCarbon Emissions Performance\nThe emissions performance (Table 1) has also been provided as per AR23. Restated figures are provided for 2019-20 and 2020-21 to \nreflect the disposal of our specialist container logistics and PFS workshop businesses.\n3\nYear\nEmissions\n2019-20\n(Baseline)\n2019-20\n(Baseline \n2020-21 2020-21\n(Restated)\n2021-22 2022-23\nScope 1 324,357 297,202 308,391 295,961 314,799 313,786\nScope 2 23,229 22,872 20,398 20,210 19,401 17,079\nScope 3* 92,493 77,495 91,061 83,763 121,390 83,911\nTOTAL 440,079 397,569 419,850 399,934 455,590 414,776\nTable 1\n* Selected scope 3 emissions categories are downstream and upstream transport and distribution; business travel;  \nwaste; and employee commuting as per the recommendations of PPN 06/21. See Appendix 1 for explanatory notes and  \nmethodology overview.\nIn FY2023, Wincanton revenue grew 2.8% to £1,462m with total scope 1,2 and 3 emissions reducing 9%. This means our carbon \nintensity by revenue reduced year on year. See graphs 1 and 2 for revenue growth and carbon intensity trends.\nThis emissions performance was delivered by continued deployment of our “Winsight” transport planning and digital transport \nsuites; reduced sub-contract road freight\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
