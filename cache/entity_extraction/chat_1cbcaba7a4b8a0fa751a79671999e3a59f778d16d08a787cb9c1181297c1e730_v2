However, there is a long way to go to turn climate management into a market practice, as \nit relies on technological innovation so that the many economic sectors have the necessary funds and access to technologies capable of offering solutions to decarbonization challenges \nwith scalability.\nBrazil still suffers from the relative lack of regional data for climate change management, such as a national bank of emission factors. In many cases, the lack of disclosure on \nemissions of greenhouse gases by the companies makes it difficult to capture the reality of certain industries. Even for industries in which the availability of information is higher, they are \nnot necessarily adequate to the national context and, even for clients already engaged and mobilized, not all technological solutions are available and accessible, such as the case of carbon \ncapture and storage technologies. We believe that innovation may have a key role in increasing the availability of data and solutions for decarbonization. Accordingly, we work on this \nagenda through Cubo ESG and dialogue with the academy, in addition to creating proprietary solutions to use data in ESG issues.\nEngagement \nEngaging different stakeholders is also a challenge due to the limited knowledge \nabout the topic, particularly in the domestic market. Internally, we have worked \nthrough training our employees and establishing a dialogue with suppliers, sector \nassociations and other stakeholders. As we progress through this process, we seek \nto ensure that the interests of different players are combined, without affecting the \nclimate ambition, which is also extremely necessary.\n 15 The Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) are the climate targets set by the signatory countries to the Paris Agreement (including Brazil) and must be updated every five years \n61 \nItaú Unibanco Holding S.A.climate report 2022\nRisk management\nClimate change requires risk management processes to \nbe reviewed, so that uncertainties imposed by physical \nand transition risks are handled, particularly on the \nmedium and long terms. Climate change impact can be \nsystemic, which prevents it from being restricted to one \nsingle risk discipline and calls for the combination of \ndifferent issues, such as credit analysis, sector targets, \nrisk appetite, and biodiversity.\nTransparency\nFinally, after undertaking the efforts to implement the climate strategy, communicate it and provide the appropriate \nlevel of transparency to the topic continues to be a challenge to financial institutions and investors. TCFD is still the \nmain framework for the disclosure of climate information, but other initiatives have arisen around the world and, \ndue to the complexity of climate change, it is also necessary to align frameworks, methodologies and indicators to \nmeet the different needs of different stakeholders. We have been making efforts to align our communications to the \nrecommendations of the TCFD and to meet the NZBA commitment.\n62 \nItaú Unibanco Holding S.A.climate report 2022\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
