Aligned with our business \nstrategy, and in support of the transition of the UK to net \nzero, our business plans involve increasing our lending to \ncustomers, which includes seeking opportunities to \nsupport their transition to net zero.\nGiven the scale of investment and the timescale required \nto transition, we expect to see an increasing proportion \nof that lending to support customers’ investments in \ngreen and transition technologies and operations. This \nincreased lending in certain sectors is expected to result \nin an increase in our absolute Scope 3 emissions in the \nnear- to medium-term. However, as more customers \ntransition, reductions in emissions intensities are expected \nto accelerate as the roll-off of high carbon intensity \nbusiness balances out the growth in new low carbon \nintensity lending, gradually resulting in decarbonisation of \nthe balance sheet. As an example, new funding of EPC A \nand B mortgages increases our lending and hence \nabsolute emissions. However, as EPC A and B mortgages \nhave lower emissions per square metre than EPC C and \nbelow mortgages, this reduces the overall emissions \nintensity for the mortgage portfolio. As properties are \nincreasingly retrofitted to improve their energy efficiency, \nthe improvement in the current stock of mortgage \nlending is expected to balance out additional emissions \nfrom new lending. The timing and pace of this change \nare uncertain, non-linear and intrinsically linked to \nbroader UK public policy, advances in technology and \ncustomer behaviours.\nOur ambition for our financing activities to be net \nzero by 2050 is aligned with the UK’s own ambition \nto reach net zero greenhouse emissions by 2050. \nHowever, the transition is not expected to be linear and \nin the near-term, we will focus on identifying opportunities \nto support customers in their transition and in turn \nreduce the emissions intensity of our financing activity. \nDuring this time we plan to focus our transition plan \nexecution on our SBTi sector-based targets to help guide \nand drive emissions intensity reductions while continuing \nto report and monitor our financed emissions in both \nabsolute and emissions intensity terms.\nWe will continue to update and evolve our \ntransition plan aligned with 2030 and 2050 climate \nambitions, noting our ability to meet our ambition \nwill be dependent on progress against the UK’s \nbroader commitment with necessary changes in \npolicy, advances in technology and customer \nbehaviour.\nAssessing the resilience of the initial iteration of \nour transition plan\n • To assess the resilience of the initial iteration \nof our Climate transition plan, we have applied \nscenario analysis to the components of the \ntransition plan: financial plan (including climate-\nspecific actions identified), as well as UK \nGovernment policies. Over 2022, we have \ndeveloped capability, through our Transition Risk \nCalculator, to allow us to integrate a consistent \nview on the climate transition policy in our base \neconomic scenario for our financial plan aligned \nwith the transition planning analysis. Refer to \nsection 3.4 for scenario analysis applied in relation \nto government policies.\n • During 2022, we continued to develop scenario \nanalysis capability, which will allow the inclusion \nof climate transition risk factors within the core \nmacroeconomic scenarios used for budgeting, \nplanning and risk assessment purposes.\n • To support this, we developed the Transition \nRisk Calculator, an internal approach to modelling \nthe impact of transition risk factors on key \nmacroeconomic variables at a sector level. \nApplying this approach as at 31 December 2022 it \nresults in a potential increase in Expected Credit \nLosses (ECLs) of less than £25 million. Going \nforward, the Transition Risk Calculator will allow us \nto test the resilience of the financial plan, used to \ndevelop the transition plan, to transition risk.\n • While initial focus of the work has been on \ntransition risk, we will also continue to enhance our \nanalysis and methodologies for physical risk.\n • The methodology allows the understanding of \nvarying climate impacts in different sectors. \nThe calculator has been designed specifically for \nshort-term macroeconomic scenarios used for \nplanning and stress testing purposes.\nFor further details of scenario analysis see  \nsection 4.2a. \n‘Net zero is the growth \nopportunity of the 21st \ncentury.’\nMission Zero, Independent Review of  \nNet Zero Report by Rt Hon Chris Skidmore \nMP, published in January 2023\n31NatWest Group plc | 2022 Climate-related Disclosures Report\nGovernance Strategy and Climate transition plan Risk Management and Scenario Analysis Metrics and TargetsIntroduction\nClimate transition plan: Sector \ninterdependencies and systems thinking\n3.4\nExtensive analysis during 2022 has focused on the identification of \nopportunities to support customers’ transition within each sector \nanalysed. This work has highlighted the importance of understanding \nsectoral interdependencies and that there needs to be a set of \ncoordinated actions between sectors to achieve economy-wide \ndecarbonisation. As an example, supply chain capabilities within the \nconstruction sector can influence the speed of retrofitting within the \ncommercial real estate sector and residential mortgages, and hence \ntheir decarbonisation.\nTo support this and continue the evolution of our initial transition plan in \n2023, we plan to adopt a systems thinking approach to identify the key \npoints of leverage to enable systems-wide transformation and \ndecarbonisation.
