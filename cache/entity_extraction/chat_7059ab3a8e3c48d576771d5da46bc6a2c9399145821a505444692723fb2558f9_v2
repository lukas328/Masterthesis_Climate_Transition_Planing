Revenue recognition depends on whether the licence is distinct in the context of the contract. \nMetal revenue: Metal revenue relates to the sales of precious metals to customers, either in pure form or contained within a product. Metal revenue arises in each of the reportable segments in the \nGroup. Metal revenue is affected by fluctuations in the market prices of precious metals and, in many cases, the value of precious metals is passed directly on to customers. Given the high value of \nthese metals this makes up a significant proportion of revenue. \nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 2023 163\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION\nNotes on the Accounts continued for the year ended 31st March 2023 \n164 \n3 Revenue continued \nRevenue judgements \nOver time revenue \nOver time revenue recognition predominantly occurs in Catalyst Technologies and PGM \nServices (Refining Services), see criteria for over time recognition as defined by the group’s \naccounting policies in note 1. \nRefining Services \nThe majority of the metal processed by the group and parent company’s refining businesses is \nowned by customers and, therefore, revenue is recognised over time on the basis that the \ngroup and parent company are providing a service to enhance an asset controlled by the \ncustomer.
