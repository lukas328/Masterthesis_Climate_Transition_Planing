The reinsurance used does not give rise to a \nmaterial counterparty default credit risk exposure for the Group. Restrictions are in place on the credit quality \nand amount of reinsurance ceded to individual counterparties. In most jurisdictions, Bupa has established fee \nagreements with healthcare provider groups to limit the impact of unexpected claims cost inflation. \n(iv) Catastrophe risk \nA natural disaster or a man-made disaster could potentially lead to a larger than expected number of claims being \nreceived over a short period of time, resulting in higher than expected claims costs. In the majority of jurisdictions, \nBupa is not contractually liable for such claims. Risks are further reduced by excess of loss reinsurance provided by \nthird-party reinsurers. Bupa’s Group Actuarial function oversees and implements strategic improvements to ensure \nthe overall adequacy of these arrangements. \nBupa Annual Report 2022 185 \n    \n                     \n             \n                 \n \n                  \n             \n                 \n                   \n                   \n  \n                    \n               \n                 \n    \n     \n                \n                \n                    \n                 \n \n                   \n     \n          \n        \n             \n                \n  \n               \n                \n                \n                \n                  \n                   \n     \n               \n               \n                \n                 \n            \n                 \n                  \n    \n                 \n                   \n                 \n                 \n                   \n              \n              \n            \n         \n          \n      \n   \nStrategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements \nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \ncontinued \n26.2 Market risk \nMarket risk is the risk of adverse financial impact due to changes in fair values or future cash flows of financial \ninstruments from fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, credit spreads and \nequity prices. The focus of the Group’s long-term financial strategy is to facilitate growth without undue balance \nsheet risk. \nIn order to reduce the risk of assets being insufficient to meet future policyholder obligations, the Group actively \nmanages assets using an approach that balances duration, quality, diversification, liquidity and investment return. \nThe Group invests in a limited portfolio of return-seeking assets (principally bonds and loans) via the regulated \nentities in the UK and Australia. These assets totalled £635m as at 31 December 2022 (2021: £632m). These \nentities use value at risk analysis (VaR) to quantify risk, taking account of asset volatility and correlation between \nasset classes. \nIn addition to local VaR analysis, the Group applies an aggregate VaR limit to all cash and investments within the \nregulated insurance entities. The Group also limits the contribution of the combined investment risk charge from \nall cash and investments, in both insurance and provision businesses, to a maximum percentage of the Group’s \nSolvency Capital Requirement (SCR). \n26.2.1 Foreign exchange risk \nThe Group is exposed to foreign exchange risks arising from commercial transactions and from recognising assets, \nliabilities and investments in overseas operations. The Group is exposed to both transaction and translation risk. \nThe former is the risk that a company’s cash flows and realised profits may be impacted by movements in foreign \nexchange rates. The latter arises from translating the financial statements of a foreign operation into the Group’s \npresentational currency. \nThe results and financial position of the Group’s foreign entities that do not have a functional currency of sterling \nare translated into sterling as follows: \n▪ Assets and liabilities at the exchange rate at the reporting date. \n▪ Income and expenses at average rates for the period. \nAll foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised initially in other comprehensive income, \nand are only subsequently reclassified to the Consolidated Income Statement in the period in which the entity \nis eventually disposed. \nForeign currency transactions in the Group’s subsidiaries are measured using the functional currency of the \nsubsidiary, which is based on the primary economic environment in which the subsidiary operates. The transactions \nare translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. \nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the \nexchange rate ruling at the reporting date; the resulting foreign exchange gain or loss is recognised in operating \nexpenses, except where the gain or loss arises on financial assets or liabilities, when it is presented in financial \nincome or financial expense as appropriate. \nNon-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency at historical cost are translated using \nthe exchange rate at the date of the transaction; therefore, no exchange differences arise. \nNon-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency at fair value are translated using the \nexchange rate ruling at the date that the fair value was determined. Transactional foreign exchange differences are \nrecognised in operating expenses. Non-monetary items include unearned premiums and deferred acquisition costs. \nTransactional exposures arise as a result of differences between the currency of local revenues and claims, typically \nin the case of international private medical insurance. The currency exposures are deemed to be acceptable but are \nkept under review by management. \nAs disclosed in Note 1.7, Türkiye became a hyperinflationary economy during the year. As a consequence, IAS 29 \nis applied and the results and balances for the Group's Turkish operations have been adjusted for changes in the \ngeneral purchasing power of the Turkish lira. In addition, all Turkish lira amounts, including transactions in the \nIncome Statement during the year, are translated to the Group's presentation currency of sterling, using the closing \nexchange rate in effect on 31 December 2022. The impact of this adjustment is recorded within other foreign \nexchange translation differences in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and within the foreign \nexchange translation reserve in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. The Group recognises the \nremaining exchange difference arising on consolidation within other foreign exchange translation differences \nthrough other comprehensive income in the foreign exchange translation reserve. \nBupa\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
