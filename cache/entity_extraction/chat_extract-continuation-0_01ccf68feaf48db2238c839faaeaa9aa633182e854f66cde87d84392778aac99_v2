Core to the work we do are these \nmain themes:\nG7 Sustainable Supply \nChains Initiative\nG7 Sustainable Supply \nChains Initiative\n\n17\nWe have reset our baseline to our \nfinancial year 2020 period to ensure \nwe have a robust datum, against \nwhich to track our emission reduction \nprogress. The science based target \napproval process required us to set a \nnew baseline to ensure alignment with \nthe target setting criteria. Measuring our \nperformance toward net zero enables \nus to demonstrate our commitments to \neffective climate action and also helps to \ncommunicate our progress, and where \nwe need to accelerate our efforts.\nOur performance against our Society \n2030: Spirit of Progress targets, including \nthose focused on energy and carbon, is \nreported externally on an annual basis, as \nwell as more frequently internally, in order \nto drive timely performance improvement \ndiscussions. We are working hard to \ndeliver our plan to reach our Scope 1  \nand 2 net zero emissions target by 2030.\nWe have capital investment plans and \nroadmaps for Diageo operational sites \nwhich enable prioritization of emission \nreductions across global portfolio each \nyear.\nWe also use key performance indicators \n(KPIs) to measure performance to \naccelerate to a low carbon world. \nSpecifically relevant to our reporting \nare GRI 302: Energy and GRI 305: \nEmissions. We measure and track \nmetrics & performance relating to energy \nand emissions across both our direct \noperations (monthly) and supply chain \n(annually). Climate change is part of \nsenior leader remuneration, linked to \ncarbon emissions & water efficiency \nperformance. We are also looking at \nmechanisms to drive improvement across \nthe business, including internal carbon \npricing.\nStrong internal governance structures \nand clear lines of accountability ensure \nthe commitments in this strategy are \nowned. Diageo’s Executive Committee, \nchaired by our Chief Executive, is \naccountable for the overall strategy and \nallocates responsibility for implementation \nto different parts of the business. At \nDiageo board level, our climate strategy \nis reviewed twice a year.\nWe engage external independent \nauditors to provide limited assurance \nof environmental performance data \n(i.e. carbon emissions and renewable \nenergy) in our annual report. In order \nto benchmark our carbon sustainability \nwork against our peers, and the wider \nbusiness community, we submit non-\nfinancial information to a range of \nsustainability focused indices throughout \nthe year. On an annual basis we \nparticipate in CDP and DJSI reporting \nto publicly disclose our performance \nand progress in these well recognized \nsustainability indices.\nDiageo was one of the top ranked \nbeverage companies in the FTSE4Good \nindex series and features on the Ethibel \nSustainability Index (ESI) Excellence \nGlobal. We have also received an A \nrating for Climate Change from CDP for \nthe last six years. \nWe encourage & support supplier \nparticipation in membership of the CDP \nSupply Chain programme, reporting on \ncollective progress annually.\nMeasuring\nOur Performance\nWe are committed to doing business the right way from grain to glass. Integral to this is \ntransparent and meaningful reporting on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues, \nas this plays a vital role in delivering our strategy. It helps us to manage ESG risks, seize \nopportunities and promote sustainable development everywhere we live, work, source and sell.\nGLOSSARY\nAdaptation: The process of adjusting to current or expected \nclimate change, and its effects.\nCarbon Credit: Also known as a carbon offset - \nmeasurable, verifiable emission reduction from certified \nclimate action projects. These projects reduce, remove or \navoid greenhouse gas (GHG)\nCarbon Footprint: A carbon footprint measures the total \ngreenhouse gas emissions caused directly and indirectly by \na person, organisation, event or product.\nCarbon Neutral: Or carbon neutrality refers to an outcome \nwhere GHG emissions have been neutralized through \npurchase or carbon offsets/credits resulting in no net \nrelease of carbon dioxide.\nCDP: A not for profit charity that runs the global disclosure \nsystem for investors, companies, cities, states and regions to \nmanage their environmental impacts.\nClimate Change: Refers to any change in climate over \ntime, whether due to natural variability or, as now known, \nunequivocally as a result of human activity. It is linked to \nglobal warming.\nClimate Emergency: The term used to inspire and organise \naction to respond to the climate and ecological emergency.\nCo-benefits: The positive benefits related to the reduction \nof greenhouse gas emissions that could relate to nature (i.e. \nwater replenishment, biodiversity increase) and/or social-\neconomic/community (i.e. employment, stability)\nCompensation: refers to reaching a balance between \nemissions and removals (offsetting), usually beyond value \nchain, and for unabated emissions on transition to net zero\nDecarbonising: The reduction of carbon dioxide (or \nequivalent) through the use of low carbon power sources, \nachieving a lower output of greenhouse gases to the \natmosphere.\nGHG Emissions: Greenhouse gas emissions. Carbon is \noften used as a term to encompass all 7 GHGs as defined \nby the Kyoto protocol, including carbon dioxide, methane, \nnitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, \nsulphur hexafluoride and nitrogen trifluoride.\nInsetting: Similar to offsetting but refers specifically \nto carbon reduction that is directly related, either by \ngeography, production, or commodity, to the organisation \nin question\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>G7 SUSTAINABLE SUPPLY CHAINS INITIATIVE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An initiative by G7 countries focused on promoting sustainable supply chain practices to address climate change and environmental impact)<|>## \n(\"entity\"<|>DIAGEO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A global beverage company committed to reducing its carbon footprint, achieving net zero emissions by 2030, and implementing sustainability strategies across its operations)<|>## \n(\"entity\"<|>G7<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An intergovernmental organization consisting of seven major advanced economies working collectively on global issues including climate change and sustainable development)<|>## \n(\"entity\"<|>SOCIETY 2030: SPIRIT OF PROGRESS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A strategic framework or set of targets set by Diageo to achieve sustainability and climate goals by 2030, including energy and carbon reduction targets)<|>## \n(\"entity\"<|>CDP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A non-profit organization that runs a global disclosure system for companies and cities to manage their environmental impacts, including climate change and water security)<|>## \n(\"entity\"<|>DJSI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Dow Jones Sustainability Index, a set of indices that evaluate the sustainability performance of companies worldwide, in which Diageo participates)<|>## \n(\"entity\"<|>FTSE4Good<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An index series that measures the performance of companies demonstrating strong Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) practices, in which Diageo is ranked)<|>## \n(\"entity\"<|>ETHIBEL SUSTAINABILITY INDEX (ESI) EXCELLENCE GLOBAL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A sustainability index recognizing companies with high standards in social and environmental responsibility, including Diageo)<|>## \n(\"entity\"<|>CHIEF EXECUTIVE<|>PERSON<|>The top executive responsible for overseeing Diageo's overall strategy, including climate and sustainability initiatives)<|>## \n(\"entity\"<|>DIAGEO BOARD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The governing body that reviews and approves the company's climate strategy and sustainability performance)<|>## \n(\"entity\"<|>SCOPES 1 AND 2<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Refers to direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions from Diageo's operations, targeted for net zero by 2030)<|>## \n(\"entity\"<|>KPI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Key Performance Indicators used by Diageo to measure progress in energy efficiency, emissions reduction, and water use)<|>## \n(\"entity\"<|>GRI 302<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Global Reporting Initiative standard related to energy reporting, used by Diageo for sustainability disclosures)<|>## \n(\"entity\"<|>GRI 305<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Global Reporting Initiative standard related to emissions reporting, used by Diageo for sustainability disclosures)<|>## \n(\"entity\"<|>Carbon Credits<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Measurable, verifiable emission reductions from certified climate action projects, used by Diageo to offset emissions and achieve carbon neutrality)<|>## \n(\"entity\"<|>Climate Change<|>EVENT<|>A global phenomenon involving long-term changes in temperature, precipitation, and other atmospheric conditions, driven largely by human activity and central to Diageo's sustainability efforts)<|>## \n(\"entity\"<|>Climate Emergency<|>EVENT<|>A term used to describe the urgent need for action to address the climate crisis, which underpins Diageo's climate strategy and commitments)<|>## \n(\"entity\"<|>Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A set of criteria used to evaluate a company's sustainability and ethical impact, integral to Diageo's reporting and strategy)<|>## \n(\"entity\"<|>Internal Carbon Pricing<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A mechanism used by Diageo to assign a monetary value to carbon emissions, encouraging emission reductions within the company<|>## \n(\"entity\"<|>Sustainable Development<|>EVENT<|>A broad concept involving economic growth that is environmentally sustainable and socially inclusive, guiding Diageo's corporate responsibility initiatives)<|>## \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
