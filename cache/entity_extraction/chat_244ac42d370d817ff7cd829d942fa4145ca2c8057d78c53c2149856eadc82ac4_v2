relation to the group’s and company’s accounts\nIt is a fundamental part of the committee’s role that we act independently from management to ensure that the interests of shareholders are properly protected in relation to financial reporting. \nWhen the accounts are being prepared, there are areas where management exercises a particular judgement or degree of estimation. The committee assesses whether the judgements and \nestimates made by management are reasonable and appropriate. In the process of applying the group’s accounting policies, management also makes judgements and estimates that have a \nsignificant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements. The group’s key accounting judgements discussed and challenged by the Audit Committee are set out below.\nSignificant current year considerations in relation to the accounts Work undertaken / outcome\nMajor impairment and restructuring activities \nKey judgements in relation to impairment testing relate \nprimarily to estimates in assessing recoverable value.\nKey judgements in relation to restructuring provisions \nrelated to estimates of future cost.\nWe received a report from management which explains the basis of recognition and estimate for impairments and \nrestructuring costs. The report also detailed how transformation-related costs were reconciled back to previously announced \ntransformation programmes. \nWe challenged the rationale behind the presentation of the costs as non-underlying, with particular focus on areas that \nrequired judgement around recognition.\nWe concluded that management has appropriately accounted for and disclosed the impacts from major impairment and \nrestructuring activities (see note 6 in the annual report).\nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 2023 97\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION\nAudit Committee Report continued\nSignificant current year considerations in relation to the accounts Work undertaken/outcome\nGains and losses on significant legal proceedings\nSignificant progress was made during the year with the \nsettlement of legal proceedings requiring accounting \nconsideration.\nWe received a report from management which summarised the outcomes and accounting implications for legal proceedings, \none of which was settled in the year at a loss of £25 million.
