In addition, Bupa expanded its work in promoting \ninclusivity by becoming the official health partner for the national \nParalympics Associations in Australia and the UK, in addition to \nexisting partnerships in Spain, Poland and Chile. \nStakeholder considerations \nAn external consultancy was engaged to carry out a materiality assessment \nto help prioritise Bupa’s investment in actions that will have the greatest \npositive impact and are most relevant for a healthcare organisation. \nPotential areas of opportunity were then tested with management and \ncustomers in Australia, Spain and the UK. The key outcome was the \nimportance of linking human health and the health of the planet. \nLong-term impact \nTaking action to mitigate climate change and related environmental issues \nthrough our sustainability strategy will help to secure our business for the \nfuture and help our customers, people and communities stay healthy. \nThe Board and Board Sustainability Committee will monitor the \nachievement of each of the three Missions in the sustainability strategy \nand can measure their achievement through KPIs. See the Sustainability \nand ESG section on page 22 for the headline KPI for each pillar of the \nsustainability strategy. \nSustainability and \nESG section on \npage 22 \nBoard \nSustainability \nCommittee report \non page 79 \nRollout of Blua \nCustomers \nIssue Action and progress Further information \nThe transformation pillar of \nour 3x6 strategy is our route \nto growth and delivering \ndigital health solutions is an \nimportant growth channel. \nAction \nWhen the 3x6 strategy was agreed in 2021, the Board identified Blua, \nour digital health solution pioneered in Spain, as a solution that could be \nrapidly deployed across our markets to benefit more of our customers and \nhelp drive Bupa’s transformation. Blua or another digital health solution\nhas been launched in ten countries so far and is driving meaningful \nprogress towards achieving the 40% and 60% ambition KPIs. The Board \nhas overseen the rollout of Blua, receiving updates during the year. \nStakeholder considerations \nCustomers’ needs and preferences are evolving rapidly as consumers \nbecome increasingly engaged with their own health and expect more \nfrom service providers in all aspects of their lives while also receiving \nvalue for money. This includes accessing healthcare services digitally \nwhere appropriate. Blua aims to meet this need and keep Bupa \ncompetitive. The speed of delivery of this service is being balanced \nwith the need to maintain appropriate controls and governance, \nparticularly around our customers’ data so that trust in our products \nand data security remains high.\n \nLong-term impact \nBlua aims to deliver access to primary and specialist virtual care, virtual \nhealth coaching and prevention services, and homecare and remote \nmonitoring, particularly for chronic conditions. This should make access \nto healthcare quicker and more personalised for our customers while \nalso delivering efficiencies for Bupa in the long-term. \nStrategy sectio n \non page 7 \nBupa Annual Report 2022 40 \n \n   \n \n   \n     \n     \n    \n   \n    \n      \n     \n  \n      \n    \n    \n     \n     \n      \n    \n     \n    \n  \n           \n          \n           \n            \n         \n          \n      \n         \n          \n         \n       \n        \n       \n \n            \n         \n              \n        \n         \n           \n \n \n           \n         \n            \n         \n      \n  \n   \n  \n   \n      \n     \n \n   \n      \n    \n    \n  \n    \n     \n   \n     \n   \n    \n  \n           \n          \n           \n        \n          \n             \n          \n            \n            \n   \n            \n         \n           \n          \n          \n         \n \n            \n              \n            \n           \n         \n              \n       \n          \n            \n          \n       \n \n           \n         \n  \n   \n \n          \n   \n   \nStrategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements \nSection 172 statement continued \nChile \nCustomers, regulators, bond investors \nIssue Action and progress Further information \nOne of Bupa’s businesses in \nChile, Isapre Cruz Blanca S.A. \n(Cruz Blanca), has been \nnegatively impacted by \njudicial and regulatory action. \nThe Isapre sector is unique to \nChile in that, despite being \nprivately-owned companies, \nthey form part of the wider \nsocial security system through \nwhich Chilean citizens can \nchose public or private health \ninsurance. There has been a \nshift in recent years which has \nseverely limited Cruz Blanca’s \nability to properly price to \ncover risk, medical inflation, \nand medical coverage. \nAction \nDuring the year, the Board has been closely monitoring political, legal \nand regulatory developments in Chile. In line with Bupa’s subsidiary \ngovernance policy, the Board has also received updates from the board \nof Bupa Chile (the parent company of Cruz Blanca). The Board also \nreceived briefings on the Chilean constitutional referendum and recent \nSupreme Court decisions. The Risk Committee has also been monitoring \nthe related “stroke of pen” risk. \nThe potential impact of the judicial decisions and regulatory \ninterventions on Bupa’s balance sheet is material and a significant \ncontingent liability position has been disclosed in the Group’s \nConsolidated Financial Statements for 2022.
