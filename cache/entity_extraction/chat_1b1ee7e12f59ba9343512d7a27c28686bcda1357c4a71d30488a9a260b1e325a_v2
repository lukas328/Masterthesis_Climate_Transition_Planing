This was \nbased on a Zurich insurers report commissioned in 2021/22. Management has considered the impact of climate change in \ntheir goodwill impairment calculations and going concern/viability forecasts.\nWe concluded that management’s key assumptions and disclosures are reasonable and appropriate.\nWe also received a report outlining how TCFD considerations are factored into the financial statements.\nProvisions and contingent liabilities (judgement)\nKey estimates are made in determining provisions in the \naccounts for disputes and claims which arise from time to \ntime in the ordinary course of business. Key judgements \nare made in determining appropriate disclosures in respect \nof contingent liabilities.\nWe received a report from management which provides information in respect of disputes and claims and identifies the \naccounting and disclosure implications which were challenged and discussed. The report included an assessment of a claim from \nthe purchaser of the Health business. This was supported by the group’s advisors whom we also discussed the matter with. \nWe concurred with management’s conclusions regarding provisioning and contingent liability disclosures.\nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 2023 99\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION\nAudit Committee Report continued\nGoing concern and viability statement\nWe reviewed the matters, assumptions and sensitivities being used to assess both the going \nconcern basis and the long-term viability of the group. This included assessing risks that \nwould threaten our business model, current funding position as well as different stress \nscenarios and mitigating actions. Further details on our going concern and viability, and the \nscenarios considered, are on page 70.\nFollowing our review and recommendation, the Board concluded that Johnson Matthey \nis able to continue operating and can meet liabilities over at least three years, which remains \nthe most appropriate timespan.\nFair, balanced and understandable (FBU)\nWe review and assess management’s process to support the Board, so it can give its assurance \nthat the 2023 Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is FBU and provides the \ninformation necessary for shareholders to assess JM’s position and performance, business \nmodel and strategy.\nManagement selected three individuals from across the group to form an FBU panel and carry \nout a detailed review of the Annual Report. To maintain objectivity, the FBU panel members \nwere not involved in drafting the 2023 Annual Report and Accounts, but all were familiar \nwith our strategy and business model. The panel members were also briefed on the role and \nprovided with detailed notes on what to consider during their review. The FBU panel, PwC \nand Annual Report project team determined whether key messages aligned with the group’s \nposition, performance and strategy, and whether the narrative sections and financial \nstatements were consistent.\nThe FBU panel presented a report to the Board, highlighting the key themes from the review \nand discussion points. The Disclosure Committee reviewed the verification process dealing \nwith the report’s factual content to further support the Board’s review.\nRisk management and internal control\nThe Committee reviews the adequacy and effectiveness of control and risk management \nsystems. These controls are a critical component of our governance and assurance \nframework, and they detail the minimum controls we need to keep our people safe, ensure \ncompliance with our standards and regulations, protect our physical and intellectual assets, \nand facilitate the accuracy and completeness of financial reporting. During the year, the \nCommittee assessed the effectiveness of these controls, considered the key identified control \ngaps, and assessed how management planned to address the findings.\nThe Group Assurance and Risk Director independently assures that our risk management \nand internal control processes operate effectively. Working closely with leadership and \nmanagement, she provides regular oversight of risk matters that affect our business, makes \nrecommendations to address key issues, and ensures that any mitigating actions are properly \ntracked, challenged and reported. During the year, our co-sourcing partnership with Deloitte \nensured we had access to additional specialist skills and expertise.\nThe group’s internal controls over financial reporting include policies and procedures \ndesigned to ensure the accuracy of our financial statements. JM’s control self-assessment and \nbusiness filing assurance processes provide management with a view of the operation of these \ncontrols. The results are presented to the Committee as part of their assessment of the \nyear-end control environment. \nThe Committee is satisfied that the group’s internal financial controls operated effectively \nthroughout the year and up to the date of approval of this report. However, these controls \ndo not provide absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss and are assessed \nbased on materiality and level of activities within the business.\nOperation of controls and assurance\nThere is an ongoing comprehensive improvement programme across JM’s financial and \noperational controls including control self-assessment which replaced our key control \nquestionnaire. While this has led to positive development in our internal controls over \nfinancial reporting, we will continue to make improvements in this area.    \nDuring the year, we spent time reviewing the control strategy, which focused on several \ncultural and operational factors to ensure JM’s readiness for the enhanced reporting \non the operating effectiveness of controls expected to be required from 2024/25. To provide \nmanagement with independent assurance over the effectiveness of the control self-\nassessment process, structured, internal controls testing will be introduced from 2024.\nGroup assurance and risk\nThe Group Assurance and Risk Director provides regular reports on internal audit reviews, \nincluding key findings, actions needed and progress on their implementation. We focus \non local, business and executive managers’ engagement levels in implementing corrective \nactions and in strengthening the control framework across all our sites. The focus of \nassurance activities during the year has been on post Covid-19 controls’ culture across the \ngroup’s locations and key strategic and emerging risks.
