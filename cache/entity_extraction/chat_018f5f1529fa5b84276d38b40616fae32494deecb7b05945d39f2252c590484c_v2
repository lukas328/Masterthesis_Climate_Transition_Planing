This can be achieved through annual auctions for low-carbon electricity contracts, including onshore \nwind and solar. The ESS also commits to reduce consenting time for offshore wind projects. \n • Flexible low-carbon generation and storage: which is expected to contribute 10% of 2035 abatement for the \nsector is rated as having “some risk” to delivery. Policies include the commitment for at least six long-duration \nstorage demonstrators to be in place by 2025, with innovation funding awarded in 2022. The Dispatchable \nPower Agreement is still being finalised with the aim that at least one CCS power plant will be operational by \nthe mid-2020s. However, although some progress has been made on low-carbon readiness standards for new \npower plants, the Hydrogen Strategy lacks a clear objective for the role of hydrogen in electricity supply.\n • Nuclear: the UK CCC rates policies for nuclear, which could potentially deliver 10% of the UK’s 2035 \nabatement, to be at “significant risk”. These policies include the ambition to deploy up to 24 GW of nuclear \ncapacity by 2050. However, funding models and timely delivery for financial close and construction, are key \nrisks.\n • Electricity market design and networks: the UK CCC 2022 Progress Report rates policies enabling flexible \ndemand (e.g the Smart Systems and Flexibility Plan, Energy Digitalisation Strategy, smart meter installation \ntargets for energy suppliers, and Ofgem implementing half-hourly settlement by 2025 to enable smart tariffs) as \nbeing “credible”. However, policies involved with expanding network capacity have “some risk” in terms of \ndelivering sufficient increased generation to meet rising demand in time. This could be improved with a new, \nindependent Future System Operator (the FSO), which will have a more strategic remit. The UK Government \nhas also committed to publishing a strategic framework in 2022, with Ofgem, on net zero networks. Ofgem has \nrecently announced a five-year plan to transform local energy grids to support the transition to a cleaner, \naffordable, homegrown low carbon energy system, by proposing significant spending of £21 billion.\nOther external dependency:\n • CCUS: is considered to be necessary for the UK to reach its net zero goal as it removes the emissions from \nhard to abate sectors. The North Sea provides significant storage opportunity and the UK Government is in the \nprocess of finalising how it will support the implementation of carbon capture technology and the building of \nstorage facilities offshore.\n • Customer behaviour change: Despite decarbonisation of the grid and electrification of the economy, material \ndemand for fuel remains, which requires a fundamental shift in consumer demand. In addition, there will need to \nbe greater public understanding and acceptance towards a future energy system featuring widely distributed \nrenewable plants and associated grid infrastructure. \n40NatWest Group plc | 2022 Climate-related Disclosures Report\nGovernance Strategy and Climate transition plan Risk Management and Scenario Analysis Metrics and TargetsIntroduction\nClimate transition plan: Helping to end the most \nharmful activities\nWe recognise that through our financing activity, NatWest Group and our customers can have environmental, \nsocial and ethical (ESE) impacts that contribute to climate change. To help us assess and manage these risks, \nwe have an ESE risk framework comprising policies and processes to give us better insight into our customers’ \nactivities and to enable us to address issues of concern.\nAs part of our climate ambition announced in February 2020, we stated that we planned to stop lending and \nunderwriting to companies with more than 15% of activities related to thermal and lignite coal, unless they had a \nCredible Transition Plan in line with the 2015 Paris Agreement in place by end of 2021, with a full phase-out from \nthermal and lignite coal by 2030; and to stop lending and underwriting to major oil and gas producers unless they \nhad a Credible Transition Plan aligned with the 2015 Paris Agreement in place by the end of 2021.\nPotential Opportunity Customer Segment Progress in 2022 Impact in 2022\nTightened Ethical, \nSocial and \nEnvironmental  \n(ESE) criteria\nCommercial & \nInstitutional\nWe continue to prohibit new lending and loan underwriting to coal customers and we plan to:\n • phase-out of coal for UK and non-UK customers who have UK coal production, coal-fired generation and coal \ninfrastructure by 1 October 2024, followed by a full phase-out of coal by 1 January 2030.\nWhile the oil and gas sector continues to play a critical role in UK energy security and the transition to clean energy, \nNatWest Group recognises the significant climate, environmental and social risks associated with it. In 2022, we further \ntightened our oil and gas ESE policy:\nWe announced we would only continue to support upstream oil and gas companies:\n • where the majority (>51%) of assets being financed are based in the UK (onshore or offshore UK Continental shelf); and,\n • where those companies report to us the overall emissions of the assets they operate by the end of 2023.\nFrom February 2023, we will not provide reserve based lending specifically for the purpose of financing oil and gas \nexploration, extraction and production for new customers, and, after 31 December 2025, we will not renew, refinance \nor extend existing reserve based lending specifically for the purpose for financing oil and gas exploration, extraction and \nproduction.\nPreviously, in December 2022 we also announced we will stop lending and loan\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
