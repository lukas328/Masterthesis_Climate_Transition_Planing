The resultant \nimpacts translate to several risks which are \ncharacterised, assessed and managed by \nNatWest Group.\nClimate risk is considered relatively significant where \nNatWest Group‘s exposure to a principal risk could be \ntaken outside of appetite due to climate-related risk \nfactors. Where this is identified, enhancements are \nrequired to the respective risk framework, so it is \nadequate to respond to climate-related risk. \nThe following drivers are considered when \nassessing potential climate-related risks:\nOur processes for identifying  \nand assessing climate-related risk\n4.2\nDuring 2022, we reviewed and refreshed our \nassessment of the relative significance of climate-\nrelated risk factors to other principal risks. This \nassessment used the judgement of risk subject matter \nexperts combined with scenario analysis, increased \ngranularity of climate data, as well as improved \nunderstanding of evolving regulatory guidance, to \nunderstand the current and potential impact of \nphysical and transition climate-related risk as a causal \nfactor to other principal risks.\nClimate-related factors were identified as \nhaving a relatively significant impact on the \nfollowing five principal risks(1):\n • credit risk\n • operational risk\n • reputational risk\n • conduct risk\n • regulatory compliance risk.\nDetails of our progress on enhancements to risk \nframeworks for these principal risks are found in the \ntable on the following page.\nClimate-related risk impact as a causal factor to  \nother principal risks will be regularly reassessed  \nand managed through the annual refresh of the \nenterprise-wide risk management framework and  \nits individual components. \nDetails of how climate risk has been sized and scoped \nfor each of the relatively significant principal risks, and \nhow frameworks have been improved in response, \ncan be found throughout this section of this report. \nClimate change is also considered as part of NatWest \nGroup’s top threats framework, for further details see \nthe risk overview section of the 2022 NatWest Group \nplc Annual Report and Accounts.\nLiability risks can arise if stakeholders consider our climate risk \nmanagement practises and disclosures insufficient and \nresponsible for, or attributable to, stakeholder losses.\nAcute Chronic\nTransition risks arises from the transition to net zero and may \narise through changes to market, technology, policy, and \nlegislation.\nPhysical risks arise from the acute and chronic physical effects \nof climate change on business operations, workforce, \ncommunities, investors, markets, infrastructure, and assets.\nMarket\nLiability \nRisks\nGovernment Policy \nand Legislation\nReputationTechnology\nLiability Risks\nPhysical Risks\nTransition Risks\n(1) Definitions of principal risks can be found in risk and capital \nmanagement section of the 2022 NatWest Group plc Annual \nReport and Accounts.\n55NatWest Group plc | 2022 Climate-related Disclosures Report\nGovernance Strategy and Climate transition plan Risk Management and Scenario Analysis Metrics and TargetsIntroduction\nClimate impact \non principal risk\nClimate \ndrivers\nHorizon Progress to date (enhancements in 2022 are in bold) Next steps \nCredit risk\nAdverse impact upon future credit \nworthiness of customers due to climate \nchange risk factors impacting asset \nvaluation, income, and costs.\nMedium – Long\n • Completed the development and launch of qualitative climate risk scorecards, which now cover \napproximately 90% of wholesale Exposure at Default(1).\n • Work commenced to develop and pilot a more quantitative and automated climate risk scorecard, \nincorporating scenario analysis and the customer transition plan assessment (CTPA) -
