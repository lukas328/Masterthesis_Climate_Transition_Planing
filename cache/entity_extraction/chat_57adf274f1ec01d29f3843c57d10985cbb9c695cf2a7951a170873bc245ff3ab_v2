We calculated these figures according to the PCAF methodology (using \nfunds outstanding) and in alignment with our net zero target boundaries (using total funds committed).  \nAs noted in our 2021 TCFD Report, we expect the quality of our annual emissions data to improve as our clients’ \nclimate disclosure and data quality and quantity increase. In our analysis this year , we found the financed \nemissions data quality scores for the Energy and Power sectors improved as follows from 2020 to 2021:\n \n FINANCED EMISSIONS DATA COVERAGE \n1 Only inclusive of counterparty data with PCAF Data Quality Scores 1 and 2. Percentages disclosed in last year’s TCFD Report \nwere based on a select group of S&P Global Trucost identifiers for directly disclosed data. The revised calculation presented in \nthe table above is instead based on data that achieves a PCAF data quality score of 1 or 2 (data from partial disclosures also \nqualifies for score 2).  \n2 Scope 3 is not tracked for the sectors for which it is not material.\n3 Data scores range from 1 to 5, with a score of 1 signifying the highest quality data and a score of 5 signifying the lowest \nquality data. Scores are weighted by drawn exposure.\n4 Due to the lower level of manual adjustments used for data sources this year, the amount of data with PCAF data quality \nscores of 1 and 2 has decreased. In instances where emissions estimates from third-party data providers were within a \nnegligible margin of emissions disclosed by clients, we deferred to data coming from the third-party dataset.\n5 This data quality score was erroneously calculated in last year’s report and has since been revised.\nData  \nCoverage \nAuto Mfg Commer-\ncial Real \nEstate\nEnergy Power Steel Thermal \nCoal  \nMining\n2021 2021 2020 2021 2020 2021 2021 2021\n% of portfolio \nreporting \nemissions: \nScope 1 and 2 \n(by committed \nexposure)1 \n94% N/A 63% 65%  \n(Excluding \nproject finance)\n81% 77%  \n(Excluding \nproject finance)\n76% 50%\n% of portfolio \nreporting \nemissions: Scope \n3 (by committed \nexposure)1,2 \n75% N/A 18% 3%4 N/A N/A 54% \n(Upstream \n6%  \n(Downstream)\n0%\nPCAF Scope 1 and \n2 Data Quality \nScore (out of 5)3\n2.1 4.4 3.25  2.9  \n(Excluding \nproject finance) \n2.9  \n(Project \nfinance only)\n3.0  2.6  \n(Excluding \nproject finance) \n3.0  \n(Project \nfinance only)\n2.1 3.1\nPCAF Scope 3 \nData Quality \nScore (out of 5)3\n2.3 N/A 3.65 3.6 N/A N/A 3.1\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
