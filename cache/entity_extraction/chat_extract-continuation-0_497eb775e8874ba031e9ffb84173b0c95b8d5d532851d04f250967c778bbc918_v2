Modelling the impact of physical risk poses material \nchallenges and limitations in comparison to transition risk. Particular challenges persist around data and \nlocation of customer assets, combined with the complexity of modelling physical risk perils and their \ninteraction with global and local supply chains. We continue to refine and enhance our physical risk modelling \ncapabilities, in particular focusing on âevent basedâ analysis to test resilience to severe weather events in the \nnear-term. Modelled losses in this analysis, although directionally insightful for risk management, must be \ntreated with caution when assessed in absolute terms due to these data and model limitations.\nModelling Limitations\nOutcomes \nEarly Action Late Action \nAssumes that stringent climate policies and \ninnovation start immediately in 2021.\n â¢ Therefore, the increase in global temperature \nis limited to under 2.0Â°C by 2050.\n â¢ Carbon prices increase steadily over the \nperiod from 2021 to 2050, which drives \nsignificant decarbonisation.\n â¢ As a result, global CO2 emissions reach net zero \naround 2050, and some jurisdictions such as the \nUS, EU, UK, and Japan reach net zero for all \ngreenhouse gases.\nAssumes that strong climate policies successfully \nlimit warming.\n â¢ Therefore, the increase in global temperature is limited to \nunder 2.0Â°C by 2100.\n â¢ However, in the Late Action scenario, decisive policy \naction on climate is delayed until 2031.\n â¢ Rapid and disorderly transition leads to a recession in the \nearly 2030s.\n â¢ Carbon prices increase rapidly from 2031 to 2050, and \nthis is enough to achieve significant reductions in \nemissions: global greenhouse gas emissions fall by 80% \nbetween 2030 and 2050 in this scenario.\nNo Additional Action \nExplores physical risks from climate change and assumes that there are no further climate policies \nintroduced beyond those already implemented.\n â¢ The absence of transition policies and associated emissions reduction leads to an increase in the concentration of \ngreenhouse gases in the atmosphere, resulting in an expected increase in global temperatures of over 3Â°C by 2050 \nand increased physical risks.\n â¢ To test more severe physical risks, this scenario accelerates the temperature pathway by 30 years, and is \nbased on the 90th percentile of the projected distribution of warming outcomes implied by climate models.\n â¢ As a result, the frequency and severity of extreme weather events such as flooding and tropical cyclones \nincreases, and there are chronic changes in labour and land productivity.\n59NatWest Group plc | 2022 Climate-related Disclosures Report\nGovernance Strategy and Climate transition plan Risk Management and Scenario Analysis Metrics and TargetsIntroduction\nWholesale transition risk insights\nEarly Action and Late Action outcomes\nFor the context of this section, NatWest Groups 2021 Climate-related Disclosure Report details the Groupâs \nwholesale transition risk methodology.\nA key outcome from our internal climate scenario analysis, carried out to support participation in the CBES \nexercise, is that transition risk is concentrated in specific sectors, with a variance in the risk profile for different \nsubsectors or customers within a sector. Our analysis suggested that 12 sectors were particularly sensitive to the \ntransition to net zero under the Late Action scenario. Transition risk has the potential to impact the credit \nworthiness of customers in these sectors. However, customers with advanced transition actions and low carbon \nrevenues at present, could potentially take advantage of increasing demand for low carbon goods and services to \ncompete for market share at the expense of customers with a greater emissions intensity, who could experience \ndeclining demand for goods and services, and loss of market share. This supported NatWest Groupâs climate \nambition and strategy, which is based on supporting customersâ transition with a particular focus on those sectors \nmost sensitive to transition risk, and on improving emissions data and analytic capabilities to track customersâ \ntransition progress. During 2022, we prioritised these sectors for developing the initial iteration of our Climate \ntransition plan.\nThe graph below provides details on potential cumulative impairments across the Early Action and Late Action \nscenarios for selected sectors. This shows that impairments are higher in the Late Action scenario across the \nmajority of the sectors. This is due to the Late Action scenario assuming a recession at the onset of transition policy \nin 2030, which is not a feature in the Early Action scenario, and a higher final carbon price than in the Early Action \nscenario. Our modelling also found the greatest in-sector variation in the power and utilities sector, with low carbon \nutilities benefiting more from the transition of the energy system to renewable electricity in the Early Action and \nLate Action scenarios, while high carbon utilities face material profit impacts once carbon pricing is introduced. \nThis highlights the importance of customer level analysis when assessing transition and physical risks. We used this \nanalysis as the starting point for our internal assessment of heightened climate-related risk sectors and subsectors. \nAll 12 of the sectors identified as sensitive to the transition to net zero, are considered heightened climate-related \nrisk sectors based on the latest assessment.
