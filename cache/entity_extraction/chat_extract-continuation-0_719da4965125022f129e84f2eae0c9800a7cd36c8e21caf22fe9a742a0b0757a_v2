Where this is the case, the Remuneration Committee will seek to structure the replacement award such that overall it is on an \nequivalent basis to broadly replicate that foregone, using appropriate performance terms. If granted, any replacement buy-out award would not exceed the maximum set out \nin the rules of the 2017 Performance Share Plan (350% of base salary).\nIf the executive director’s prior employer pays any portion of the remuneration that was anticipated to be forfeited, the replacement awards shall be reduced by an equivalent \namount.\nOther The Remuneration Committee may agree that the company will meet certain mobility costs and relocation costs including temporary living and transportation expenses, \nin line with the company’s prevailing mobility policy for senior executives as described in the policy table on page 107.\nService contracts and policy on payment for loss of office\nThe following table summarises relevant key provisions of executive directors’ service contracts and the treatment of payments on termination of employment.

Full disclosure of the payments will be made in accordance with the remuneration reporting requirements.\nThe table on the following page describes the contractual conditions pertaining to the contracts for Liam Condon and Stephen Oxley and for any future executive director.\nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 2023 115\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTSOTHER INFORMATION\nRemuneration Policy continued\nSummary of key provisions of executive directors’ service contracts and treatment of payments on termination\nLiam Condon Stephen Oxley\nDate of service agreement 10th November 2021 1st December 2020\nDate of appointment as director 1st March 2022 1st April 2021\nEmploying company Johnson Matthey Plc\nContract duration No fixed term.\nNotice period No more than 12 months’ notice\nPost-termination restrictions The contracts of employment contain the following restrictions on the director for the following periods from the date of termination of employment:\n• non-compete – six months\n• non-dealing and non-solicitation of client/customers – 12 months\n• non-solicitation of suppliers and non-interference with supply chain – 12 months\n• non-solicitation of employees – 12 months.\nSummary termination – \npayment in lieu of notice \n(PILON)\nThe company may, in its absolute discretion, terminate the employment of the director with immediate effect by giving written notice together with payment \nof a sum equivalent to the director’s base salary and the value of his contractual benefits as at the date such notice is given, in respect of the director’s notice \nperiod, less any period of notice actually worked.\nThe company may elect to pay the PILON in equal monthly instalments. The director is under a duty to seek alternative employment and to keep the \ncompany informed about whether they have been successful. If the director commences alternative employment, the monthly instalments shall be reduced \n(if appropriate to nil) by the amount of the director’s gross earnings from the alternative employment. A PILON paid to a director who is a US taxpayer \nwould be in equal monthly instalments.\nTermination payment – change \nof control\nIf, within one year after a change of control, the director’s service agreement is terminated by the company (other than in accordance with the summary \ntermination provisions), the company shall pay, as liquidated damages, one year’s base salary, together with a sum equivalent to the value of the director’s \ncontractual benefits, as at the date of termination, less the period of any notice given by the company to the director.\nTermination – treatment of \nannual incentive awards\nAnnual bonus awards are made at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.\nExecutive directors leaving the company’s employment will receive a bonus, pro-rata to service, unless the reason for leaving is resignation or misconduct. \nAny bonus awarded would continue to be subject to deferral as set out in the Remuneration Policy.\nIn relation to deferred bonus awards which have already been made, shares will be released on the normal vesting date unless one of the following \ncircumstances applies, and subject to the discretion of the Remuneration Committee:\n• the participant leaves as a result of misconduct; or\n• the participant, prior to vesting, breaches one of the post-termination restrictions or covenants contained in their employment contract, termination \nagreement or similar agreement.\nIn which case the deferred awards will lapse on cessation of employment.\nThe Remuneration Committee has the discretion to accelerate vesting of a deferred award if appropriate to do so to reflect the circumstances of the \ndeparture.
