The companies have resolved \nroughly 80% of governance and 60% of management strategy issues identified before fiscal year 2016.\n In light of factors such as Japan’s commitment to carbon neutrality, investee companies have also furthered \ntheir response to environmental and social issues and have resolved about 50% of the issues identified in \nfiscal year 2018.\n We will continue to identify and follow themes centered on critical issues for investee companies.\n0%\n20%\n40%\n60%\n80%\n100%\n2018 2019 2020\nEnvironment/social \nissues\n0%\n20%\n40%\n60%\n80%\n100%\nbef.2016 2017 2018 2019 2020\nGovernance\n50%\n80%\n＜ Status of the issues raised in each fiscal year as of the end of June 2021 ＞\n①\n②\n③\n④\nMedium-term Engagement Outcomes\nRaise issue: Dai-ichi Life raises a matter it considers to be an issue with a company\nRecognize issue: The company recognizes that it must address this issue\nAddress issue: The company begins addressing the issue\nSolve issue: Dai-ichi Life confirms that the issue has been solved\nProgress of \nengagementTracking engagement milestones\n①\n②\n③\n④\n9. Report on Stewardship Activities (Our History for stewardship activities and Review)\nIf a company does not show any improvement on ESG issues, including climate change, Dai-ichi will vote to \noppose reappointment of representative directors. In Dai-ichi’s experience, the majority of companies are willing \nto engage in dialogue and they do improve on issues Dai-ichi raises. Despite its best efforts to support transition, \nif a company refuses to recognize or address an issue Dai-ichi has raised, Dai-ichi will take that into account in its \ninvestment decision-making and may ultimately divest its holding. \nAchieving all four milestones can take some time. For example, Dai-ichi has been engaging with an iron and steel \ncompany since 2016. 206 Dai-ichi first engaged the company about setting climate change targets and creating a \nroadmap to reduce its GHG emissions. In 2019, the company endorsed TCFD and disclosed its scenario analysis \nresults. By 2021, the company disclosed its CO₂ emissions reduction targets. Getting to that point required six \nengagement sessions. Dai-ichi classifies the climate change issues as having been “addressed” by the portfolio \ncompany (milestone 3 in Figure  16) and will continue engaging, pushing it to conduct more sophisticated scenario \nanalysis and to support its emissions reduction initiatives.\nENGAGEMENT STRATEGY\nCONTENTS  |  FINANCIAL INSTITUTION NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLANS — FUNDAMENTALS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND GUIDANCE\n68\n \nExample 15.

Accelerating change , November 2021.\nSwedish bank SEB has placed “supporting our customers and society at large” at the center of its efforts to \naccelerate change. 207 Recognizing that as a bank, it interacts with large corporations and financial institutions, \nSMEs, private individuals, employees, shareholders, and wider society, SEB sees engagement as an opportunity to \nachieve its “strong ambition to accelerate the pace towards a sustainable future.” 208 \nSEB has outlined how it will engage customers to make a positive impact through engagement, including those it \nhas identified as green, in transition, or suitable for selective engagement. At the same time, where it finds that a \ncustomer’s convictions do not align with SEB’s, it will not shy away from phasing out engagement with that client \nin an orderly fashion. Figure  17 shows how SEB approaches engaging — and disengaging, when necessary — with \ncompanies in its credit portfolio. 209\n \nFigure 17.
