Please see page 226 \nfor a definition of secondary PGMs.\nWe can also apply our longstanding recycling expertise to emerging technologies that utilise \nPGMs, like fuel cells and electrolyser stacks. We are upgrading our infrastructure to allow us to \nrecover and refine the PGMs used in these technologies to a very high purity in the same way \nwe do today with production scrap. This will allow us to create an endless loop of PGMs availability.\nOur performance in 2022/23\nOur ability to meet our target of 75% of our products using secondary PGMs depends on \nworking with our customers and market research team to understand both supply and \ndemand as well as the total volume of secondary PGMs available through our refining circuits \nand the broader PGMs market. Our focus is on closing the PGMs loop to meet our customers’ \nevolving sustainability demands. But we acknowledge that primary, or new, supply is still \ncritical to maintain market balances and will play an important role in the transition to net \nzero. Customer demand will help to drive this balance. We are perfecting our secondary \noffering to customers and working with both internal and external subject matter experts \nto certify our methodology.  \nOur performance in this area this year was impacted by the economic headwinds faced \nby the global economy, more specifically in the auto market supply chain. Secondary scrap \navailability and a large share of the PGMs products that are manufactured depend on the \nhealth of the global automotive market. 2022 presented many challenges to both sides \nof the secondary metal equation, as global auto sales struggled to maintain post-pandemic \nmomentum. This eventually led to a downturn in automotive scrap being sent back through \nPGMs recycling channels, but also impacted demand for fresh PGMs products. Despite these \nchallenges, we have been able to manage our metal intake portfolio to remain on track \nto meet our 2030 target.\n1.

We are committed to protecting  \nthe ecosystems around our plants and minimising all our potentially harmful interactions. \nThe Societal Value Committee is responsible for our overall approach to environmental \nperformance.\nOur global environmental, health and safety (EHS) policies, processes and management \nsystem help us maintain a high level of environmental performance. All our sites are  \nassessed against these standards by our centralised EHS audit team at least once every  \nthree years. 89% of our manufacturing sites use environmental management systems  \nthat are certified as meeting ISO 14001 standard, as of 31st March 2023.\nWe measure progress against our environmental KPIs monthly and use the data to improve \nperformance.\nMinimising waste: reduce, reuse, recycle \nWe are committed to minimising waste generation and recycling as much as possible.  \nOur operations create waste, which is always treated in line with local regulations.  \nBut beyond that we are committed to disposing of it responsibly. We work with specialist \ntreatment companies to ensure this waste is managed safely. \nWe are always looking for ways to improve. For example this year:\n• At our UK refinery, improvements in process operations allowed flue dusts to be reworked \ninto furnaces which eliminated a waste stream. There were general reductions in waste \nfrom improving production processes so that less off-specification material was produced. \n• At our Smithfield site in the US we upgraded our NOx abatement system.
