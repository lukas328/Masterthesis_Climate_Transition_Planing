The policy was informed \nby consultation with key stakeholders, including our institutional investors and shareholder \nadvisory bodies.\nSubject to approval, the policy will apply for three years from the 2023 AGM. The key changes \nto the policy are set out below:\n• The payout for achieving the threshold performance target under the AIP is to be reduced \nto 25% of the target opportunity. It was previously 15% of the maximum opportunity, \nwhich is equivalent to 30% of the target opportunity. This change represents a modest \ntoughening of the bonus structure and affects all participants in our annual incentive plans \nand will result in greater focus on delivery against the Group’s targeted performance levels.\n• The threshold vesting percentage for each performance measure within the long-term \nPSP will be set at the time of each award having regard to the targets set. The vesting at \nthreshold for each performance measure will be no more than 25%. For example, if the \ncommittee set a broader range of EPS targets than in prior years this may result in threshold \nvesting being as low as 0% as opposed to 15% (or higher) for that part of the award.\n• Given our refreshed strategy will require investment over the coming years there will be \nno defined ROIC underpin applied to future PSP\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
