We base much of this work \non the 2019 TCFD-aligned risk analysis and company-wide risk processes. We have set \nScience-Based T argets (which will be submitted for approval to the Science-Based T argets \nInitiative (SBTi) in 2022) for Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions and other climate-related goals \n(which include zero waste to landfill targets). Additionally, each business group has a \ndedicated sustainability lead and team responsible for the development of the business-\nspecific sustainability strategies and oversight. Climate-related peformance data is \nreported in ODISEO, our centralized sustainability reporting platform. \nIn 2021, we established the Sustainability Council composed of sustainability leads \nfrom all our business groups and operational experts to construct, implement and take \nownership of Orbia’s sustainability strategy. The Council is informed by internal and \nexternal best practices, and leverages opportunities for cross-business cooperation \nwhere performance improvement can be accelerated and new ideas can be developed \neffectively. \nThe Sustainability Council is currently comprised of thematic sub-groups, two of which \nare focused on decarbonization and circularity. These groups identify ways to incorporate \nimpactful sustainability strategies across the business groups, support the management \nof climate-related initiatives and opportunities for the business groups, and report on \ntheir progress to the Sustainability Council. Orbia’s Council is continuously identifying \ninnovative opportunities to enable decarbonization and increase the resilience of Orbia’s \nbusiness model. This allows the selection of cost-effective and impactful emission-\nreduction tools appropriate for specific markets and regions. \nCorporate Governance\n \nOrbia executive compensation structure\nFor further information:\nFrom 2021, an ESG performance modifier \nfunds up to +/- 10% of the annual bonus of \nsenior management, based upon achievement \nof defined ESG metrics across 4 areas.

Most importantly, Orbia’s \nbusinesses are committed to addressing some of the most pressing challenges the world \nis facing today, including ensuring food security, reducing water scarcity, reinventing the \nfuture of cities and homes, connecting communities with data and information services, \nand expanding access to health and well-being by providing advanced materials, specialty \nproducts and innovative, human-centered solutions. As Orbia transforms into a low impact \nand resilient set of businesses, climate change continues to represent a core challenge. \nEach business group regularly develops and adapts their strategy to ensure Orbia’s \nproducts and solutions address risks and opportunities related to climate change. \nScenario analysis\nScenario analysis is a growing, critical tool that companies use to test both the resiliency \nof their business models and adapt strategic planning to reflect emerging realities in the \nmarketplace. Through scenario analysis, our business planning can take variables such \nas carbon taxes, disruptive technologies, changing customer preferences, government \npolicies, and other micro- and macro-economic factors into account.\n \nIn our 2019 climate risk analysis, both physical and transition scenarios were used \nas inputs to establish a suite of projected future changes in climate that illustrate the \npossibilities that may lie ahead. \nAs part of our continuous improvement processes, we are collaborating with different areas \nof our organization to strengthen our scenario analysis capability.
