Example interplay between the four key financing strategies and portfolio emissions 248\nKEY FINANCING  STRATEGY EXAMPLE IMPACT ON PORTFOLIO EMISSIONS (NOT EXHAUSTIVE)\n1. Climate solutions • If a portfolio company meets increased demand for its low-emissions technology, \nits own emissions could likely increase and the financial institution’s overall portfolio \nemissions may increase  proportionally.\n• Conversely, if entities using low-emissions technologies are included in the financial \ninstitution’s portfolio, overall portfolio emissions could decrease as the technology  \nis deployed. \n2. Aligned • Portfolio emissions could decrease as more companies or clients in the portfolio are \naligned to net zero.\n3. Aligning • Portfolio emissions could increase with the addition of more high-emitting real-\neconomy firms that are just beginning to transition.\n• As firms execute their net-zero transition plans, reductions in portfolio emissions in \nline with 1.5 degrees C-aligned pathways take place.\n4. Managed  phaseout • Portfolio emissions may initially be higher if the financial institution is financing high-\nemitting assets with plans to accelerate their retirement.\n• Significant reductions in portfolio emissions may only occur as the phaseout plan \nis completed.\n248 Recall that portfolio emissions include those associated with a financial institution’s investment, lending, and underwriting \nportfolios, or from clients of investment consultants or financial service providers.\n249 GFANZ. Guidance on Use of Sectoral Pathways for Financial Institutions , June 2022.\nWhere possible, a financial institution should test \nthe assumptions around the inputs used in the \ncalculation of real-economy targets and metrics \nto assess how the institution’s performance and \nprogress may be impacted by external conditions \nthat differ from the initial assumptions (e.g., \navailability of technology or government policies). \nAdditionally, financial institutions should consider \nhow external influences, such as regional policies \nand sectoral pathways, may affect their transition \nplan assumptions. 249 \nTable 9 presents guidance for each approach, \nparticularly on metrics. Such metrics could be \nbased on emissions or on transition-related \ncategories and should consider both backward- \nand forward-looking methodologies as shown  \nin examples in the Financial Institution Net-zero \nTransition Plans — Supplemental Information report. \nConstructing a target framework that best \naccounts for key financing strategies of climate \nsolutions, incentivizing real-world decarbonization \nefforts, and managed phaseout requires further \nresearch to establish net-zero benchmarks (see \n“Expansion of metrics and targets” section \nin the Financial Institution Net-zero Transition \nPlans — Supplemental Information). In addition, \nfinancial institutions should consider working \ntoward expressing an umbrella metric, transition \nfinance, to represent the proportion of their total \nbusiness that relates to the four key financing \nstrategies collectively.\nMETRICS AND TARGETS\nCONTENTS  |  FINANCIAL INSTITUTION NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLANS — FUNDAMENTALS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND GUIDANCE\n82\nTable 9. Guidance for metrics and target setting across four key financing strategies to net-zero capital \nallocation and related  services\nKEY FINANCING  STRATEGY GUIDANCE\n1. Climate solutions Financial institutions seeking to enable and finance the development or scaling of \nclimate solutions should consider a range of metrics to track the impact of solutions on \nreal-economy emissions reduction. Target setting for climate solutions is still nascent, \nbut, where available, sectoral pathways could be used to set targets in line with the \nscale needed to achieve net zero. (See “Expansion of metrics and targets” section in \nthe Financial Institution Net-zero Transition Plans — Supplemental Information  report \nfor further discussion.)\n2. Aligned Financial institutions supporting those companies or assets that are already substantially \naligned should determine the metrics to monitor progress of financing of this key strategy. \nThese metrics could be drawn from criteria used to assess the current and ongoing \nalignment to a 1.5 degrees C pathway of the companies or assets. The criteria should also \nbe reviewed and updated over time.\n3. Aligning Financial institutions supporting those companies that have committed to transition \nand are beginning the process, or are still transitioning, should determine metrics to \nmonitor links between financing support and transition activities, as well as progress \nof financing of this key approach. These metrics could be drawn from the criteria of \nwhat “transitioning” means. This criteria will be similar to that for companies and assets \nalready aligned to net zero but account for an earlier stage of transition activity and \ndepend heavily on net-zero transition plans and their execution. The criteria should also \nbe reviewed and updated periodically.\n4. Managed  phaseout The GFANZ report The Managed Phaseout of High-emitting Assets provides initial   \nand preliminary guidance on a net zero-aligned approach to financing or enabling \nhigh-emitting assets where there is a plan for their early retirement. The report notes \nthat such an approach would need its own metrics and targets. Financial institutions \nshould consider metrics that demonstrate how a Managed Phaseout plan through  \nearly retirement will reduce emissions as well as broader impacts (e.g., related to  \nthe workforce). \n2. Metrics and targets for plan execution  \nFinancial institutions should set targets and monitor \nmetrics that indicate their organization’s progress \nin executing on their net-zero transition. Similar \nto other strategic plans of the institution, clear \ncorporate financial and operational KPIs should be \nmonitored and reviewed on a regular basis. These \ncould pertain to any of the themes and components \ndiscussed in this report that show activity of \nthe institution’s teams in applying their net-zero \ncommitment to parts of the business. \nFinancial institutions should select metrics and set \ntargets for engagement programs, in alignment\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
