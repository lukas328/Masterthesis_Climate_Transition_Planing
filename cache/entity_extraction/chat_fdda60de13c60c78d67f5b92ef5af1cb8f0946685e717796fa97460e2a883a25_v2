The Emerging \nMarkets Transition Debt strategy officially launched just after the \nreporting period, on 4 April 2024. \nThis new strategy complements our existing sustainable fixed \nincome offering with a focus on sustainability in the emerging world: \nEmerging Africa Infrastructure Fund (EAIF) , which for the past two \ndecades has provided flexible, patient debt capital to a diversified \nportfolio of impactful infrastructure projects in Africa 9; and Emerging \nMarkets Sustainable Blended Debt , which invests with the belief \nthat countries with improving ESG metrics will build more sustainable \neconomies and unlock higher productivity, leading to outperformance \nof their assets.\n9. Ninety One (and its successor company) was awarded the mandate to manage EAIF in May 2016.\n28\nSustainability and Stewardship Report\nExpanding our range \nof sustainable strategies\nEmerging Markets Transition Debt\nWe believe enabling investment in climate-change solutions and \ntransition opportunities is the most direct way an asset manager \ncan contribute to real-world decarbonisation. Developed during \nthe reporting year and launched shortly after, Emerging Markets \nTransition Debt is a significant addition to our range of strategies \ntargeting these outcomes. Invested at the intersection of impact and \nreturn, it will offer an integrated portfolio of private and public debt, \nproviding transition finance to emerging markets – at commercial \nrates – to support emission-avoiding industries and infrastructure, \nand to drive improvements among high emitters.\nFor our Sustainable Equity  strategies, which target a diverse range of \ninvestments expected to benefit from sustainable progress, the focus of \nour work in the reporting period was on enhancing the assessment and \nmeasurement frameworks we use to quantify and evidence positive impact \nfor the companies our sustainable equity and multi-asset strategies invest in. \nThese methodologies allow us to identify companies whose future revenue \ngrowth is supported by a sustainability driver, and to track and measure their \nimpact via a key performance indicator (KPI). KPIs are selected on a case-\nby-case basis for each holding. The ‘climate adaptation’ category has been \nrenamed ‘climate adaptation and water’, reflecting research we have done in \nthe past year into tracking and measuring the impact of solutions to the world’s \nwater challenges, which we regard as a large addressable market in itself.\nDuring the reporting period, we refined KPIs for a number of companies and, \nwhere needed, engaged to encourage the disclosure of additional data to \nhelp us more accurately track the KPI. Our methodologies currently include \nthose in the following table.\nThe majority of the assets managed in our Sustainable Equity strategies were \nin companies whose impact we track via a relevant KPI. We classify these as \n‘sustainable solutions providers’. In terms of the total number of holdings, at the end \nof 2023 about 73% of the companies held across the Sustainable Equity portfolios \nwere sustainable solutions providers. All of the companies in the Sustainable Equity \nportfolios meet our criteria for internal sustainability; i.e., they are run in a way that \nwe regard as sustainable, but are not assessed as making a measurable impact in \none of the six sustainable structural-growth areas detailed above. \n29\nSustainability and Stewardship Report\nEnhancing our \nmeasurement frameworks\nMethodology Description\nDecarbonisation Providing products or services that displace carbon \nemissions versus the alternative.\nClimate adaptation and water Contributing to helping those affected by the physical \nimpacts of climate change.\nFinancial inclusion Providing financial services to underserved groups.\nHealthcare impact Promoting healthcare inclusion and reducing health \ninequality.\nAccess to education Dissemination of educational and knowledge \nresources and providing training to help\nclose skills gaps. \nDigital inclusion Bringing access to digital technologies, infrastructure \nand services to underserved cohorts.\nThe following examples show impact KPIs that were calculated via the \nabove methodologies and tracked for sustainable equity and multi-asset \nportfolio companies in 2023.\nCompany selected to illustrate approaches to measuring impact used by Ninety One Sustainable Equity strategies.
