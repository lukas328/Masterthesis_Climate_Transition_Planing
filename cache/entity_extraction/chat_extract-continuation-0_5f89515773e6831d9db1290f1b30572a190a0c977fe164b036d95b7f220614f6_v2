Primarily relates to assets under construction and initial fair value of additions. \nGains and losses on revaluation are recognised in the property revaluation reserve, except where an asset is \nrevalued below historical cost, in which case the deficit is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. \nWhen a revaluation reverses losses recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in prior years, the credit \nis recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. \nIn the current year, a £44m net revaluation deficit (2021: £26m deficit) has been recognised in the property \nrevaluation reserve, with a revaluation loss of £33m (2021 loss: £10m) charged to the Consolidated Income \nStatement within other income and charges (see Note 2.4). \nRecognised in the carrying amount of freehold property is £63m (2021: £70m) in relation to freehold property \nin the course of construction. \nHistorical cost of the Group's revalued freehold property assets \n2022 2021 \n£m £m \nHistorical cost of revalued assets 2,088 2,128 \nAccumulated depreciation based on historical cost (465) (423) \nHistorical cost net book value 1,623 1,705 \nDepreciation charge for the year on historical cost 42 43 \nImpairment of tangible assets \nA review of tangible assets has resulted in impairments of £124m (2021: £6m), of which £117m is related to Bupa \nDental Care UK and is a result of the overall CGU impairment review, the drivers of which are explained in Note 3. \nIt has also been identified that there are reasonable changes in assumptions on the Cromwell CGU impairment test \nthat could lead to the impairment of the £115m right-of-use asset. Currently there is headroom on the CGU of £22m. \nThe headroom is primarily sensitive to forecast cash flows driven by the mix and volume of procedures, staff costs \nand operating costs; a 10% reduction in cash flows reduces that headroom by £24m. \nNote 5: Investment property in brief \nInvestment \nInvestment properties are physical assets that are not occupied by the \nGroup and are leased to third parties to generate rental income. Most \nproperty \ninvestment properties held by the Group relate to a portfolio of retirement \nvillages in New Zealand. \nInvestment properties are initially measured at cost and subsequently at fair value, determined individually, on \na basis appropriate to the purpose for which the property is intended. Investment property is revalued annually \nwith any gain or loss arising from a change in fair value recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement within \nfinancial income and expense. \nIn an active market, the portfolio is valued annually by an independent valuer, holding a recognised and relevant \nprofessional qualification, and with recent experience in the location and category of investment property \nbeing valued. \nIn Australia and New Zealand, the retirement village market is fragmented as each village is unique due to \nbuilding configuration and location. As there are no directly comparable sales from which values can be derived, \nthe fair value of investment property is determined using inputs that are unobservable. Therefore the Group has \ncategorised investment property as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy in accordance with IFRS 13 Fair Value \nMeasurement. These properties are valued using discounted cash flow projections based on reliable estimates \nof future cash flows. \nBupa Annual Report 2022 152 \n \n       \n    \n    \n       \n         \n      \n       \n                 \n                \n         \n                \n                  \n                \n                  \n                    \n                    \n \n          \n      \n \n   \n \n    \n                 \n                  \n    \n \n       \n   \n    \n \n                  \n                \n            \n \n \n \n   \n       \n           \n                 \n            \n                  \n                 \n          \n          \n      \n   \nStrategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements \nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \ncontinued \n2022 2021 \n£m £m \nAt beginning of year 666 627 \nAdditions 29 37 \nDisposals (1) – \nIncrease in fair value 29 27 \nReclassification from property, plant and equipment – 1 \nForeign exchange 27 (26) \nAt end of year 750 666 \nIn the current year, a revaluation surplus of £28m (2021: £27m) was credited to the Consolidated Income \nStatement which is net of £1m (2021: £nil) attributable to occupational right agreement liability holders and \nis paid upon exit of the retirement village. \nThe carrying value of investment properties primarily consists of the Group's portfolio of retirement villages in \nNew Zealand of £681m (2021: £604m) and Australia of £55m (2021: £50m). These were valued by management \nusing internally prepared discounted cash flow projections, supported by the terms of any existing lease and \nother contracts. Discount rates are used to reflect current market assessments of the uncertainty in the amount \nor timing of the cash flows. During the year, an independent valuation of the New Zealand portfolio was performed \nby Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL), and this valuation, also based on a discounted cash flow model, was in line with \nmanagement’s valuation. \nThe historical cost of investment properties is £482m (2021: £440m). \nSignificant assumptions used in the valuation include: \nAustralia and New Zealand \nDiscount rate 14.0% \nCapital growth rate 3.2% - 3.5\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BUPA<|><|>ORGANIZATION<|>Bupa is a healthcare group that owns and manages a portfolio of retirement villages, dental care services, and other healthcare assets.
