The impacts of COVID-19 have subsided in most \nof our markets but persisted in parts of our Asia Pacific \nMarket Unit. \nRevenue of £14.0bn was up 7% (2021: £13.1bn) at \nconstant exchange rates (CER) with growth in all our \nbusiness lines and underlying profit1 before taxation \nof £575m was up 43% at CER (2021: £402m) as a result \nof strong customer demand and included a number of \none-off exceptional trading items in our Market Units, \nwhich are broadly neutral at a Group level. \nDuring 2022, global inflation rose sharply resulting in \nhigher central bank interest rates, leading to increased \ncost of capital which reduces the valuation of business \nunits for impairment testing. There were asset \nimpairments across goodwill, other intangibles and \ntangible assets during the second half of the year \ntotalling £1bn. The material Business Unit impairments \nwere UK Dental (£646m), Bupa Chile (£161m), BVAC \nAustralia (£103m) and UK Care Services (£90m). These \nwere the result of macroeconomic, and in some cases, \nsectoral and operational factors which are further \ndetailed below. \nStatutory loss before taxation of £(427)m is a decline \nfrom a profit of £423m in 2021 (a 201% decline at AER). \nNet cash generated from operating activities was \n£966m, up £47m on prior year (2021: £919m) primarily \ndue to strong underlying trading performance of our \ninsurance business. \nSolvency II capital coverage ratio remains strong \nat 181% (2021: 179%) reflecting positive underlying \nperformance with leverage (excluding IFRS 16 liabilities) \nimproving to 18.6% (2021: 19.6%). \nFinancial highlights \n£14.0bn £575m £966m \nRevenue \n+8% AER 2021: £12.9bn \n+7% CER 2021: £13.1bn \nUnderlying profit1 \n+42% AER 2021: £405m \n+43% CER 2021: £402m \nCash generated from \noperating activities \n+5% AER 2021: £919m2 \n£(427)m \nStatutory (Loss)/profit \n-201% AER 2021: £423m \n26.3% \nLeverage (incl.

Underlying profit is a non-GAAP financial measure. This means it is not comparable to other companies. Underlying profit reflects our trading \nperformance and excludes a number of items included in statutory profit before taxation, to facilitate year-on-year comparison. These items include \nimpairment of intangible assets and goodwill arising on business combinations, as well as market movements such as gains or losses on foreign \nexchange, on return-seeking assets, on property revaluations and other material items not considered part of trading performance. A reconciliation to \nstatutory profit/loss before taxation can be found in the notes to the financial statements. \n2. 2021 has been restated for the implementation of the IFRS Interpretations Committee agenda decision on Demand Deposits with Restrictions on Use \narising from a contract with a Third Party.
