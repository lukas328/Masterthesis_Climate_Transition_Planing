The emissions factors are sourced through the U.S. \nEPA’s Center for Corporate Climate Leadership GHG Emission Factors Hub, (April, 2022 update). \nGlobal warming potential (GWP)\nGWP is applied to CH4 and N2O emissions to calculate the total CO2e emissions.

A common metric used for transmission \npipeline companies to track their GHG emissions is methane emissions intensity, which is a measure of \nmethane emissions relative to natural gas throughput. A 2020 methane emissions intensity of 0.142% \nwas reported by ONE Future Coalition for the transmission and storage sector . This average methane \nemissions intensity was calculated based on U.S. companies representing 56% of U.S. pipeline mileage. \nWith the limitation of regional data access, this U.S.-based average methane emissions intensity \nwas used to estimate GHG emissions for all natural gas pipelines projects in the FY2021 dataset.

Data from six Chinese oil pipelines were adopted as the \nthe benchmark case study to reflect emissions produced in different stages.\nThe average calculated life cycle emissions intensity based on the case studies is 1.45*10-5 tCO2e/t-km. As \napproximately 30% of emissions come from pipeline operation phase, an emissions intensity of 4.36 * 10-6 \ntCO2e/t-km was applied to estimate emissions from liquid pipeline projects using the annual throughput \nand pipeline distance data. The equation used to calculate GHG emissions is listed below.\nwith t-km = a unit of measure representing the transport of one tonne of goods over  \nthe distance of one kilometer\nNote: the pipeline distances provided reflect a network of pipelines with many entry and delivery points \ninstead of point-to-point pipelines, and as a result, there is a possibility of overestimating emissions as the \nproducts do not travel through the whole network.\nFloating production storage and offloading (FPSO)\nPublished CO2 intensity is applied to calculate GHG emissions for oil and gas production.\nLiquified natural gas (LNG) processing plants\nGHG emissions calculated for the LNG plant projects are based on project specific emissions factors \nsourced through company reports.\nCO2e emissions (tonnes) from  \nnatural gas pipeline operations X Xnatural gas Throughput (scf) \nX Xmethane density methane emissions intensity (%) methane GWP\nmethane content of natural gas (%)=\nCO2 emissions (tonnes) from  \noil pipeline operations X\nX X\nXannual Oil Throughput (bbl) conversion factor (tonnes/bbl)(9) \npipeline distance (km) 4.36 10-6 tCO2e/t-km\n=\n7 Liquid pipelines use the unit t-km in their financed emissions calculations.
