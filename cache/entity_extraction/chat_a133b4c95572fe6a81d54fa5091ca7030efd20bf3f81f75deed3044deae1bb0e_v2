Phoenix plans to increase \ninvestments in illiquid assets and sustainable investments over the \nnext five years (subject to regulatory and market conditions), to \nsupport house building, green energy, and local communities \nacross the country, without compromising policyholder  \nprotection. As an example, we are collaborating with the \nChamber of Commerce in Edinburgh to support a just transition \nto a low-carbon economy, as part of an eight-year programme \nthrough to 2030.\nClimate-nature nexus \nIncreasingly, nature is regarded as the ‘next frontier’ for the \nfinancial sector, as the sector’s management of climate-related \nfinancial risks becomes more sophisticated and as \nunderstanding of the interdependencies between climate \nand nature-risk increases. \nAt the hands of human activity, nature is being rapidly degraded \ndue to changes in land and ocean use, over-exploitation of \nnatural resources, climate change, water and air pollution and the \nintroduction of invasive species. Climate change is both a driver \nand a consequence of the degradation of nature and, as a result, \nfurther degradation is likely to significantly hamper the world’s \nability to achieve its climate net zero goals.\nCompanies in our investment portfolio, supply chain and our \noperations can both impact and depend on nature, resulting in \nphysical, transition and systemic risks to our business. We are at \nthe start of our journey in managing nature risk and opportunity, \nthat will be critical in ensuring our long-term sustainability as \na business.\nThe Taskforce for Nature-related Financial Disclosures (‘TNFD’) is \ndeveloping a framework to help assess nature-related risks and \nopportunities, and follows a similar structure to TCFD. We are \nworking with our asset management partners and data providers \nto pilot test the LEAP (Locate, Evaluate, Assess and Prepare) \napproach, which is a concept introduced in the draft TNFD \nframework to help corporates to identify their nature-related \nrisks. We will aim to adopt the final recommendations of the \nTNFD framework to allow us to start integrating nature into \ndecision-making.\nIn 2022 we released our nature statement, which sets out our call \nto action. We will:\nInvest in the future\n• Understand the impact and dependence of our investment \nportfolio on nature and review our investment strategy to take \nnature-related risks and opportunities into consideration\n•  Through our stewardship approach, work with our asset \nmanagement partners and investee companies to help  \nhalt and reverse the degradation of nature\n•  Seek investment opportunities which actively support the \ntransition towards a nature-positive economy.\nLead by example\n•  Identify, measure and reduce our direct and indirect impact \nand dependency on nature through our own operations\n•  Reduce our wider impact and dependency on nature by \nencouraging all suppliers to align to a nature-positive ambition\n•  Adopt the final recommendations of the TNFD framework  \nto allow us to start integrating nature into decision-making\nEngage to multiply our impact\n•  Collaborate through nature-related alliances and with partners \nto exchange knowledge and develop common approaches  \nto help deliver change and thought leadership\n•  Engage our customers, c.6,800 employees, communities  \nand wider stakeholders on the role they can play in delivering  \na nature-positive economy\n•  Work with regulators and policymakers to support the \nstandardisation of approaches and advance the nature agenda.\n1 Green Jobs Taskforce.\n2 International Labour Organisation.\n19\nPhoenix Group Holdings plc Net Zero Transition Plan\nInvest Engage Lead\nEmbedding net zero \nin our business\nBecoming a \nnet zero business Measuring our progress\nExecutive \nsummary\nInvest at a glance 21\nSize up exposure 22 \nPlan the journey 26\nExecute actions 29\nMonitor and refine 41\nInvest\nInvest Engage Lead\nEmbedding net zero \nin our business\nBecoming a \nnet zero business Measuring our progress\nExecutive \nsummary\n20\nPhoenix Group Holdings plc Net Zero Transition Plan\nOur financed emissions account for 99% of our Group’s carbon \nfootprint.
