Furthermore, we are \nstrengthening our processes relating to products with \nhigher aggregated value. \nData Protection and Cybersecurity \nGRI 3-3: Material topic (Ethics, integrity and compliance)\nAffected capitals: Intellectual capital and Social capital\nWhat is the risk? We are subject to the risks associated \nto non-compliance with applicable data protection laws, \nand we can be negatively affected by the imposition of \nfines and other types of penalties. Violations, interrup-\ntions or defects in our information technology systems \n(including as a result of cybersecurity attacks) can inter-\nrupt our operations and negatively impact our businesses \nand reputation.\nHow do we manage this? We are constantly working \nto ensure the security of our technological environment \nand protection of our assets. We have adopted a compre-\nhensive approach that involves a wide range of technolo-\ngies, policies and contingencies. We hold regular training \nsessions designed to raise our employees’ awareness of \ninformation security practices, with the aim of ensuring \nthat they are all engaged in keeping our cybernetic sys-\ntems and the integrity of our data safe.\nTo meet the increasing regulatory demands and guaran-\ntee protection of the personal data that we handle, we \n2022 Integrated  \nReport\nOur way of  \ndoing business\nOur strategy\nCulture and \nEngagement\nValue Generation\nIndicators  \nand annex\n3\n4\n5\n6\n2\nPresentation1\n32\nhave developed a comprehensive privacy program.

We are committed to maintaining our approach \nto information security, always updating and constantly \nevolving, with the aim of guaranteeing the best possible \nprotection for our technological assets and the data that \nwe handle. \nTax \nAffected capital:  \nFinancial capital\nWhat is the risk?  \nChanges to the tax laws or their interpretation can in-\ncrease our tax burden and, as a result, negatively affect \nour operational results and financial situation. Further-\nmore, disputes over compensation of tax credits and the \nuse of tax incentives can represent risk to the Company's \nreputation.\nHow do we manage this?  \nThe tax strategies adopted by BRF include the mitigation \nof risks to the corporate reputation, and the transactions \nbetween the companies within the group are subject \nto the Policy for Related Parties, meaning they are also \nsubject to the Transfer Pricing laws and regulations of \neach country or region where the related companies are \ndomiciled. We have also implemented a Tax Management \nPolicy that establishes directives, roles and responsibil-\nities relating to tax compliance, a topic that has its own \nmanagement team responsible for ensuring adherence \nto currently applicable legislation at federal, state and \nmunicipal levels; reducing risks and improving our inter-\nnal processes  (find out more about this in our Policy on \nOur approach to cyber risk and data protection \ncombines policies and procedures, as well as \nthe directives of our privacy program.\nRelated-Party Transactions and the Tax Management Policy). \nFurthermore, we have a matrix of SOX and NSOX controls \nin the Tax Department, the purpose of which is to guaran-\ntee the accuracy of the information. The strategic topics \nand initiatives connected to taxation are evaluated by the \nTax Committee whilst the Vice-President of Finance and \nthe directors of the department have the power of veto. If \nnecessary, these issues are the object of decisions taken \nby the committees and/or corporate bodies.\nWhat opportunities exist?
