representation\nIn the coming years, we also intend to set targets for diversity that \ntruly represent the many regions that we work in � We will start by \nintroducing ethnicity as an additional diversity focus area in 2023 � \nUnlike gender, we cannot set global targets for ethnicity due to the \nEuropean General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) � However, we \nwill use nationality as a proxy to track our global progress, while \nencouraging our regions to set their own regional targets where it is \nlegally permissible to record our employees’ ethnicity (e �g� in the \nUSA)� While we will not be able to set ethnicity targets globally, our \nawareness-raising campaigns and initiatives will focus on ethnicity �\nOne such example is our recently entered partnership with The

and inclusive employee lifecycle\nWe know that working on diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging \nrequires a detailed assessment of every single aspect of our \nemployee lifecycle structures and processes to ensure an equitable \nmeritocracy where we mitigate bias � We have therefore taken steps \nto initiate a detailed assessment of our attraction and recruitment \nprocesses, onboarding, learning and development, Continuous \nPerformance and Development dialogues, promotion processes, \nand talent selection � We already engage in many efforts within all \nthese areas (e �g� unconscious bias training for recruiters, language \nsoftware to aid inclusive communication in job ads, inclusive \nleadership training and exit surveys) � We know this is an area which \nrequires continuous improvement, and it will therefore remain an \nongoing project � \nWe have also continued to focus on pay equity � This work follows on \nfrom the implementation in late 2020 of a robust Vestas job \nframework � The framework enables the evaluation and comparison \nof job roles and provides a clear view of pay equity across the \norganisation � We also continued to gather insights, both through \nresearch and learnings from pioneers, on how to move forward with \npay equity from a strategic and tactical perspective � This included \naligning our pay equity efforts with the broader DEIB agenda � To \nfurther support our wider People & Culture community, we created \ntools and guidelines to ensure conscious decisions are made when \nsetting pay, and we have started our journey to train our People & \nCulture community in pay equity �\nEmbedding inclusion in our culture: inclusive leadership training\nWe aim to create a true culture of inclusion where all our colleagues \nfeel a sense of belonging, are able to be their true selves, and can \nreach their full potential � To do so, we need to enable all our people \nmanagers to role-model inclusive leadership and allyship � For this \nreason, we have decided to roll out mandatory inclusive leadership \ntraining for all our people managers � We aim to have trained 80 \npercent of all our people managers by the end of 2023, starting with \nsenior management � As of 2022, we are well ahead in reaching this \ngoal� After the pilot for the training was successfully carried out in \nJune 2022 with our management team in Taiwan, we began to roll \nout the actual training in August 2022 to our regional management \nteams� Latin America, North America, and Northern Central Europe \nwere among the first to complete their training in December 2022 �\nCultural diversity 1  \nNumber of nationalities (#)\nGenerational diversity 1 \nEmployees by age group (%)\nGender diversity 1 \nGender of

continue \nuntil the end of 2023 � Similarly, our inclusive leadership training is \nalso an embedded module across our talent programmes, such as \nRising Executives and the Regional Talent Programme, and was an \nextensive part of the Vestas Leadership Forum 2022 �\nGlobal DEIB Team & Regional initiatives\n2022 has seen great progress for DEIB � Most notably, we have for \nthe first time brought together all our informal DEIB representatives \nacross our regions and functions under the umbrella of the Global \nDEIB Team� The team connects DEIB representatives and agents \nacross our regions to exchange cross-regional knowledge, share \nbest practices, support one another in DEIB initiatives, and discuss \nregional challenges and how to address them � The team was \nlaunched
