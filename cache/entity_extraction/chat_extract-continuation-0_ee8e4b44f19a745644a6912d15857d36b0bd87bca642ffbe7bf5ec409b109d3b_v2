All Group totals and electricity breakdowns use market-based Scope 2 emission factors. Group carbon footprint includes tenant consumption, excludes client-\nbased workers.\n2. Scope 1 Emissions Combustion of fuel and operation of facilities – includes Natural Gas, Diesel, LPG, Fugitive Emissions and Fleet Vehicles.\n3. Scope 2 Emissions purchase of electricity and heat by the Group for its own use. Market-based emissions use supplier-based emission factors, and energy \nattribute certificates for where 100% renewable supplier tariffs are not in place.\n4. Scope 3 includes emissions from purchased goods and services, fuel- and energy-related emissions, air travel, rail travel, taxis, hotels and ground transfers, \nwaste, water, employee commuting (including homeworking) and upstream leased assets.\n5. DEFRA UK Government GHG Conversion Factors are used for our UK sites, and all business travel, water, waste, upstream leased assets and extrapolated data. \nUS EPA factors are used for United States electricity and employee commute factors. IEA and GHG Protocol emissions factors are used to calculate Scope 1, 2 \nand Scope 3 fuel- and energy-related emissions for international sites where available. Defra IO factors have been adjusted to reflect reporting year consumer \nindex pricing to estimate emissions related to purchased goods and services. US and UK National Travel Surveys have been used to inform our estimations for \nemployee commuting. Emissions related to working from home have been based on EcoAct’s ‘Homeworking emissions whitepaper’ (2020).\n6. Scope 3 emissions are not separately reported by UK and Rest of Group, due to the collection of travel, purchased goods and services and other data at the \nGroup level.\n7. Energy attribute certificates have been purchased to claim renewable electricity consumption for all sites where 100% renewable supplier tariffs are not in place. \nThese certificates have been sourced from an internationally recognised trader who is an IETA member and gold partner of CDP.\n8. 2019 and 2020 total carbon emissions have been restated to reflect the acquisition of Refinitiv.\n9. % Change is calculated between 2021 and 2019, the Group’s target baseline year.\n10. Emissions from sites not included within the reporting boundary relate to the divestment of Borsa Italiana and have been published for transparency.\n11. The revenue figures for 2019, 2020 and 2021 are based on a ‘pro-forma’ approach to align with our global greenhouse gas inventory.\nCONTENTS\nLSEG CLIMATE TRANSITION PLAN 202216\nOur commitments\nOur ambition and targets are \nunderpinned by our external \ncommitments and memberships \nincluding the United Nations  \nClimate Change ‘Race to Zero’  \nand the UN Global Compact’s \nBusiness Ambition for 1.5°C.\nWe have set near-term targets, approved by the science-based targets initiative, \nagainst a 1.5°C trajectory to:\nHalve our scope 1\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CAMERON-COLE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cameron-Cole is an organization involved in environmental verification and consulting services, particularly related to greenhouse gas protocols and standards)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WRI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>World Resources Institute (WRI) is a global research organization focused on environmental sustainability, climate change, and related standards)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WBCSD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) is a CEO-led organization of companies committed to sustainable business practices)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GHG PROTOCOL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Greenhouse Gas Protocol is a set of standards for measuring and managing greenhouse gas emissions, developed by WRI and WBCSD)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ISO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>International Organization for Standardization (ISO) develops international standards, including ISO 14064-3:2006 for greenhouse gas verification)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LSEG<|>ORGANIZATION<|>London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) is a global financial markets infrastructure company, actively involved in climate transition planning and sustainability initiatives)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLIMATE TRANSITION PLAN<|>EVENT<|>LSEG's Climate Transition Plan is a strategic document outlining the company's goals and actions to address climate change, including emissions reduction targets)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SBT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) is an organization that helps companies set greenhouse gas reduction targets aligned with climate science)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REFINITIV<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Refinitiv is a data provider that was acquired by LSEG, involved in environmental data and analytics)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UK<|>GEO<|>United Kingdom, a country with environmental policies and standards relevant to the report)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>US<|>GEO<|>United States, a country with environmental policies and standards relevant to the report)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEFRA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>UK Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs, providing emission factors and environmental data)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EPA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>United States Environmental Protection Agency, providing emission factors for US data)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IEA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>International Energy Agency, providing energy and emissions data)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CDP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Carbon Disclosure Project, an organization that certifies renewable energy certificates and supports environmental reporting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EcoAct<|>ORGANIZATION<|>EcoAct is a consultancy providing data and whitepapers on emissions, including homeworking emissions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Science-based targets<|>EVENT<|>Targets set by companies, approved by SBTi, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in line with climate science)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>2021<|>EVENT<|>Year for which the emissions data and progress are reported)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>2019<|>EVENT<|>Baseline year for emissions comparison)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>2022<|>EVENT<|>Year mentioned in the context of progress and planning)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GHG PROTOCOL SCOPE 1<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Scope 1 refers to direct emissions from owned or controlled sources, such as fuel combustion)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GHG PROTOCOL SCOPE 2<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Scope 2 refers to indirect emissions from the purchase of electricity, heat, or steam)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GHG PROTOCOL SCOPE 3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Scope 3 includes all other indirect emissions in the value chain, such as business travel, employee commuting, and purchased goods)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Total group carbon footprint<|>EVENT<|>The total greenhouse gas emissions of the group, measured in tons of CO2 equivalent, reported annually)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Renewable electricity<|>EVENT<|>Percentage of electricity consumption that is renewable, indicating sustainability efforts)\n##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
