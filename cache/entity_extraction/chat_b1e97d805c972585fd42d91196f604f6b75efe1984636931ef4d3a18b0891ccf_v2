Disclosure of emissions will be needed to understand our clients’ current emissions \nprofiles and transition opportunities and to inform future business decisions.\nNet Zero Review Template   \nIn 2022, we began piloting a Net Zero Review Template. Corporate clients with material emissions relative \nto our baseline in the Energy and Power sectors are reviewed, with a conclusion as to the strength of their \ntransition plan. Where we identify clients that have important gaps, our intent is to work with them on their \nown transition strategies.\nThe Template shares some of the same inputs as the Climate Risk Assessment & Scorecard (CRAS) \n(described further on page 41), including absolute emissions and emissions intensity data as well as \ndisclosed targets. The Template also includes the climate score output from the CRAS. The Template \nincludes questions on a company’s decarbonization plan, including factors such as governance, scope \n(what emissions categories are included), capital expenditure plans and asset retirement schedules (where \navailable/applicable), among others. \nWe plan to have Net Zero Review Templates for additional sectors as interim net zero targets are set. We \nalso plan to track client progress once baselines per sector are established. A sample of the considerations \nwithin the Template are provided below, but we expect that the Template may be further refined after the \npilot stage.\nTCFD REPORT 2022: CITI’S APPROACH TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND NET ZERO | 31\n \nBiodiversity  \nIn last year’s report, we highlighted some of the issues intersecting climate including biodiversity and nature. \nCiti remains committed to expanding our understanding of the dynamics between climate and biodiversity \nand, to that end, engaged in the early development process for the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial \nDisclosures (TNFD) as a member of the initial Informal Working Group. We now serve as a member of the \nTNFD Forum. Citi has closely reviewed biodiversity risks and impacts under our ESRM Policy since its 2003 \ninception, first focusing on project-related financing and later adding sector-wide reviews to evaluate \nalignment with international standards in management practices to avoid, minimize and mitigate potential \nbiodiversity impacts.\nCiti’s Global Data Insights (CGDI) team has also been exploring the biodiversity data landscape and has \nbegun to consider how we can integrate such information across our business. The CGDI team has been \naccepted as part of TNFD’s Data Catalyst Group, which was launched in July 2022 to convene market \nparticipants with high-quality, trusted data on biodiversity risks to respond to the lack of adequate, \ndecision-useful biodiversity data. \nNet Zero Review Template Summary: Inputs and Considerations\nBusiness Metrics r  Revenues, returns and historical client relationship\nr  Future business opportunities\nCompany Decarbonization Plan r  Stated decarbonization plan or strategy\nr  Targets applicable to sector , target years and coverage (Scope 1, 2 and 3)\nr  Governance, including Board oversight and ties to remuneration\nr  Assessment of strengths and weaknesses of transition plan\nEmissions Data r  Scope 1, 2 and 3 absolute emissions and emissions intensity\nr  PCAF data quality score (indicating the extent to which emissions are  \n        disclosed or need to be estimated)\nr  Emissions assurance status\nOutput from Climate Risk \nAssessment Scorecard\nr  Overall score and score breakdown\nCapital Expenditures r  Insight regarding capex allocated towards transition and towards  \n        traditional businesses\nOther Considerations r  Emerging markets presence\nr  State-owned enterprise\nr  Energy security factors\nr  External benchmarks\nCiti Net Zero Metrics \n(Sector-Specific)\nr  Attributed absolute emissions, emissions intensity and climate  \n        alignment score for relevant sectors\nOutput Assessment of strengths and weaknesses incorporating perspectives from \nclient engagement\n32 | TCFD REPORT 2022: CITI’S APPROACH TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND NET ZERO\nAvoiding Deforestation   \nAn important part of the intersection between climate and biodiversity is avoiding deforestation. To \nthat end, Citi remains committed to our long-standing ESRM Policy, which, since inception, has included \na commitment to not engage with companies known to be in violation of local or national forestry and \nlogging laws. We require our forestry clients operating in tropical forests to be members of the Forest \nStewardship Council (FSC) and to pursue FSC certification (an assurance that products come from forests \nthat are responsibly managed, providing social, economic and environmental benefits). This also includes \nthe establishment of management systems consistent with the principles of No Deforestation, No Peat and \nNo Exploitation (NDPE). We annually review our forestry clients to confirm their ongoing commitment to \nthese principles.\nCiti is also a member of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) and requires all downstream palm \noil clients (processors and traders) to become members of the RSPO. These clients must commit to a time-\nbound action plan to achieve 100% RSPO certification within three to five years of becoming a Citi client. \nCiti’s ESRM team monitors progress annually on alignment with RSPO principles and criteria to ensure \npalm oil clients’ operations are consistent with the principle of NDPE. We evaluate our clients’ identification \nand preservation of high conservation areas (including peatlands and high carbon stock forests) and \nimplementation of best practice fire prevention to avoid causes of deforestation\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
