Using the SBTi’s Net Zero Guidance released in October \n2021, our work in 2022 will identify our path to net zero from 2030 \nacross our business operations and value chain with the adoption of \nmeasurable targets and interim KPIs.\nTo help achieve this, we will invest in nature-based solutions and other \ncarbon-reduction technologies to remove from the atmosphere or \noffset more carbon than LSEG emits each year. By 2040, we aim for \n100% of unavoidable emissions to be neutralised with an equivalent \namount of carbon removals. This will involve the purchase of carbon \nremovals and the scoping and implementation of an internal carbon \nprice starting with business travel. Such a tool would factor the external \ncost of greenhouse gas emissions into business and investment \ndecisions to incentivise efficiency and enable low-carbon innovation.\nLSEG CLIMATE TRANSITION PLAN 202233\nCONTENTS\nHow we disclose and report on progress\nDisclosing data and progress transparently ensures we are not only \naccountable for our commitments, but in making our data public we  \nare also encouraging transparency in the market. \nWe commit to monitoring and reporting in alignment with best practice on \nsustainability disclosures and we intend to report our net zero progress in our \n2023 Climate Transition Plan alongside other reports where we disclose our \nsustainability performance including:\n – LSEG Annual Report & Accounts \n – Annual Sustainability Report\n – CDP Climate Change disclosure\n – TCFD Report \nFurther information\nFor further information regarding LSEG’s sustainability approach  \nplease see lseg.com\nLSEG is more than a diversified global financial \nmarkets infrastructure and data business.\nWe are dedicated partners to our customers, with an open model and commitment to excellence.
