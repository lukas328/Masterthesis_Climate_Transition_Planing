The appointment is \nreviewed every year. The Committee is of the view that Deloitte provides independent remuneration advice and \ndoes not have any connections with Bupa that may impair its independence. Deloitte is a member of the \nRemuneration Consultants’ Group and voluntarily operates under this group’s code of conduct when providing \nadvice on executive remuneration in the UK. Deloitte’s fees for services to the Committee in 2022 were £62,850 \non a time and materials basis. During the year, Deloitte advised on market practice, corporate governance and \nregulations, remuneration benchmarking and other matters that the Committee was considering. \nOther teams within Deloitte provided unrelated tax and consulting services to Bupa during the year. \nThe Terms of Reference of the Committee were reviewed by the Committee and adopted by the Board in \nDecember 2022.
