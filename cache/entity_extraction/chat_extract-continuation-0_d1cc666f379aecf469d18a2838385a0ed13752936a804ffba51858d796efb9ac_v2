A collective effort is required \nfrom finance, the public sector, civil society, and \nthe real economy. Sharing transition lessons \nlearned, pooling resources to address common \nchallenges where appropriate, and developing \ncollaborative initiatives will benefit all institutionsâ€™ \ntransition plans.\nGuidance: Financial institutions should pursue \nwith peers (where relevant, appropriate, and in \ncompliance with all applicable antitrust laws) and \nother industry-related bodies working in these \nareas,213 any of the following objectives that are \nconsistent with their net-zero priorities and support \n1.5 degrees C alignment:\n213 Industry-related bodies may include civil society and nongovernmental organizations providing subject matter expertise, \ntargeted initiatives, and collaborative opportunities, among other purposes (e.g., Council for Inclusive Capitalismâ€™s Just Energy \nTransition Framework for Company Action, ShareAction, WWF, World Resources Institute).\n1. Learn from other institutions  through \ndiscussion, and share noncompetitive, \nnonconfidential details about tools, data, and \nmethodologies that enable and accelerate the \ndesign, implementation, assessment, and review \nof a net-zero transition plan. For example:\n â€“ encourage adoption of net-zero transition \nplans across the industry, particularly with \nless advanced peers, by being transparent \nabout implementation experiences/\nlessons learned;\n â€“ seek common approaches or frameworks \nto support comparability, driving further \nmomentum and accountability;\n â€“ collaborate where appropriate to solve \nchallenges that arise in designing and \nexecuting a transition plan. For example, \npursue joint transactions or financing \nvehicles to increase scale of net zero-\nfocused services and tools, such as industrial \nclusters for hydrogen or carbon capture \nstorage technologies; \n â€“ engage in cross-sector initiatives in the real \neconomy to help accelerate the phaseout of \nhigh-emitting assets and rollout of transition \ninfrastructure; and\n â€“ work to encourage appropriate government \nnet-zero targets and strategies; promote \ngovernment policies, regulations, and \nenvironments that facilitate net zero-\naligned investment; advocate against \npolicies that may act as roadblocks to the \nnet-zero transition; and encourage science-\nbased public policies that incorporate \ntransition considerations.\nENGAGEMENT STRATEGY\nCONTENTS  |  FINANCIAL INSTITUTION NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLANS â€” FUNDAMENTALS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND GUIDANCE\n71\n2. Represent a pan-financial sector view on \ncritical issues , including those communicated \nto governments, the public sector, and real-\neconomy counterparties.
