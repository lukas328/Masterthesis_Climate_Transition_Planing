This \nwork included assessment of opportunities for NatWest Group to support its agricultural customers to reduce and \nreverse impacts to climate and environment as well as engagement with the UK Government, wider food system \nand NGOs to create practical solutions to support farmers and landowners to contribute to the achievement of the \nUK’s climate targets.\nKey products and services to support decarbonisation:\n • Development of green lending products: As part of our £100 billion climate and sustainable funding and \nfinancing target, we continue to provide funding that meets customer need and incentivises transition across a \nrange of business models to enable sustainable agriculture. On 1 January 2023, we expanded the scope of \nlow-carbon technologies and practices that qualify for climate and sustainable funding under the “Sustainable \nAgriculture” category.\n • Supporting agriculture customers through rising cost of living: In July 2022, we made available £1.25 billion \nin lending support for agricultural customers through a range of measures including loans, asset finance, and \nincreased overdraft limits. The lending support also aims to help farmers fund their transition to more \nsustainable practices, through the bank’s lending products. Refer to the case study on page 44 for an example \nof support provided to customers in the agriculture sector.\n • Partnership with the Sustainable Food Trust to digitise the Global Farm Metric (GFM): The GFM \nestablishes a common language and baseline of data for sustainability which has the potential to strengthen and \nalign existing metrics of the food and farming industry. We are supporting the digitisation of the GFM to provide \nit as a tool to farmers to make it easier for them to measure and track the climate and nature impacts from \nchange in their practices. In 2023, we will work with both farmers and food suppliers who use other \nmeasurement tools to test inter-operability with GFM with an aim to develop more consistent measurements.\n • Developing partnerships with food manufacturers and retailers: aligned with the systems thinking \napproach, we are working with selected food manufacturers and retailers to co-develop financial solutions that \nwill allow farmers in their supply chain to have access to our climate and sustainable funding and financing. We \nplan to continue this in 2023 by co-designing financial solutions appropriate for the procurement practices of \nagri-food businesses to scale access to our financing for green and transition activities, to their farmers. \nExternal dependencies to support transition:\nCustomer and other external dependencies\n • Customer awareness: customers in the agriculture sector are at an early stage of their transition journey. As a \nresult, the current focus to support transition is on increasing awareness and providing customers with tools \nsuch as the Global Farm Metric so they can assess the emissions impact of their activities.\n • Cost of living challenges faced by customers: overall inflation for input costs to farmers is around 25%, but \nmore than 200% for key inputs such as fuel, fertilisers and animal feed. These high costs are putting capital \nconstraints on agri-food customers, limiting their ability and willingness to invest in buying low-carbon equipment \nand adopting changes in practices that have high upfront costs and longer time scales to pay back the farm for \nachieving environmental outcomes.\n • Technology developments: lower carbon technology developments, including low carbon farming practices \nsuch as hydrogen for heavy mobile equipment, are required to reduce emissions intensity.\nTo support our customers we will continue to engage with the UK Government and private and NGO partners to \ncreate partnerships and collaborations to align fiscal, regulatory and market incentives to support farmers and \nlandowners to achieve mass-scale in decarbonisation.\n • Joint statement with WWF, Tesco and Nature-Friendly Farming Network to DEFRA: In November 2022, \nWWF, NatWest Group, Tesco, and the Nature-Friendly Farming Network signed an joint statement to the UK \nGovernment to raise the ambition of, and encourage delivery of, all parts of the Environmental Land \nManagement (ELM) Scheme to support English farmers to work with nature, reduce their input costs, and \nadapt to a changing climate, all while providing healthy, affordable, and sustainable food. This joint statement \nwas signed by over 50 organisations across the food system. This is the first-time that representatives from \nfood and finance have come together in support of strengthening ELMs. In 2023, we will continue to work \ncollaboratively with these signatories.\n • Sustainable Markets Initiative: NatWest Group and WWF co-hosted an interactive event at COP27 in Sharm \nEl-Shaikh that had over 60 senior executives representing policymakers, companies, farming organisations, \nNGOs and financial institutions involved in the global food system to share experiences and develop practical \nand action-oriented solutions to enact the recommendations in the SMI Agricultural Taskforce’s Report “Scaling \nRegenerative Farming: An Action Plan”.\n42NatWest Group plc | 2022 Climate-related Disclosures Report\nGovernance Strategy and Climate transition plan Risk Management and Scenario Analysis Metrics and TargetsIntroduction\nThe UK CCC 2022 Progress Report rated the policies expected to reduce emissions from agricultural and land use activities by adopting low-carbon farming and \nproductivity measures for both livestock and arable land as being at “significant risk” in delivering outcomes to the scale needed to achieve climate targets due to \nlack of clarity or insufficient plans. The UK CCC 2022 Progress Report has also provided an overall score of policies targeted at financing activities that can \nsequester carbon as sinks by planting of hedgerows, trees, soil sequestration and restoring peatlands as being at “significant risk”.\nNoted below are the key policies, including related abatement potential and UK CCC’s assessment in 2022: \n • Productivity and low-carbon
