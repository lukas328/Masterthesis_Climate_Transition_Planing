We must play our part by \nproviding solutions through innovative design, \nmaterial choices – and clear action to amend \nworking practices to deliver change.\nThe Buro Happold routemap to net zero carbon \nformalises existing processes and introduces new \nones, demonstrating our commitment to the \npositive impact we can have on environments \naround us. It reflects our founding values, \nreconfirms the importance of our involvement in \nsuch critical work and demonstrates how we will \ncontinue to deliver for people, places and planet.\nThis net zero routemap lays out a framework \nthat will support two of our core climate targets. \nBy 2030 our goal is to design all new build \nprojects to be net zero carbon in operation and \nto reduce the embodied carbon intensity of all \nnew buildings, major retrofits and infrastructure \nprojects by 50% from a 2020 baseline. With the \nlaunch of our net zero routemap, Buro Happold \nwill operate within a structure that actively \nfocuses on how we can meet the necessary \nrequirements of net zero – and how we can \nsupport our clients in doing the same.\nThe routemap is split into three areas: advisory, \ndesign and operations. It demonstrates not \nonly that we know where we need to go, but \nprecisely how this will be achieved. We have clear \ntargets to hit, and our routemap will support us in \ndelivering them.\nThe following pages show the key areas that make \nup our net zero routemap, in detail. The routemap \nmoves us further down our path to net zero. \nIt is a journey that we invite all our clients and \ncollaborators to join us on.\nINTRODUCTION\nBURO HAPPOLDNET ZERO ROUTEMAP\n2\nOUR TARGETS\nnet zero carbon\nBy 2030,\nnet zero\ncarbon\nin operation\n50%\nour goal is to design all\nnew build projects to be\nour goal is to reduce the \nembodied carbon intensity of all \nnew buildings, major retroﬁts and \ninfrastructure projects by\nfrom a 2020 \nbaseline\nBy 2030,\nBURO HAPPOLDNET ZERO ROUTEMAP\n3\nNet Zero\n2030\nKEY\nPILLARS\nACTION\nAREAS\nSectors\nKnowledge\nCommunications\nData\nBuildings\nClients\nCities and regions\nInfrastructure\nGovernance\nAdvisory\nDesign\nOperations\nbenefits to\nour clients\nStrategic insights\nH elping our clients to set and\nachieve their goals\nNew opportunities and lower risk\nEnabling our clients to access the\nnew low carbon economy\nLower whole life carbon\nDoing the right thing, whilst reducing consumption\nand enhancing energy eﬃciency at the same time\nEnhanced asset value\nMeeting future expectations\nin a low carbon economy\nStronger brand\nH elping our clients to diﬀerentiate \nthemselves from their peers\nKEY AREAS OF ACTIVITY\nBURO HAPPOLDNET ZERO ROUTEMAP\n4\nADVISORY\nDESIGN\nOPERATIONS\nSectors Understand and/or contribute to net zero roadmaps in each sector and region we operate in.\nInfrastructure Support the clean energy transition through strategic advice, infrastructure design and commercial \nstructuring, prioritising solutions that best support system-wide decarbonisation.\nKnowledge Set relevant sustainability objectives for all staff and share knowledge across the practice through \nmultiple channels.\nCities and regions Understand and/or contribute to net zero climate policy and strategy in each of the cities \nand regions we operate in.\nBuildings Target net zero for every building project by identifying appropriate* targets, presenting \na net zero concept design option, and measuring carbon performance.\nGovernance\nEnsure carbon management underpins all our work and track progress against our plan.
