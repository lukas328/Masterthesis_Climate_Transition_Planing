This was due to \nthe implementation of mitigating actions \nthat reduced our risk exposure to a level the \nGLT assessed to be satisfactory. Implemented \nmitigating actions included:\nRobust process for  \nproduct introduction that \nensures we capture our \nown IP with  \nthe appropriate  \n‘freedom to operate’\nLaunch of standardised  \nIP awareness e-learning \nprogrammes across JM  \nfor all employees and  \nnew starters\nImprovement of our  \ntrade secret management \nprocess, allowing us  \nto monitor and protect  \nour trade secrets  \nacross the globe\nAs a result, our IP risks are now \nmanaged on a ‘business as usual’ basis \nand will only be escalated back to the \nGLT if there is a material increase in our \nrisk exposure. This allows our senior \nleaders to focus their resources on the \nhighest priority risks to JM.\nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 2023 69\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION\nRisk report continued\nGoing concern\nIn adopting the going concern basis for preparing the accounts, the directors have considered \nthe business activities as set out in the Strategic report and Financial review, pages 1 to 72, \nas well as the group’s principal risks and uncertainties, pages 62 to 69. As part of this \nassessment, we have considered a base case and severe but plausible trading scenario. \nBoth scenarios showed sufficient headroom under our committed facilities and financial \ncovenants. The directors therefore believe that the group has adequate resources to fund \nits operations for the period of 12 months following the date of this announcement, making \nit appropriate to prepare the accounts on a going concern basis. Further details on going \nconcern, viability and facilities can be found in Note 1 on page 150 respectively of the \naccounts.\nViability\nWe have assessed how viable we are as a business over a three-year period, in line with our \nannual planning horizon. During the year, the Board carried out a robust assessment of the \nprincipal and emerging risks affecting our business, particularly those that could threaten \nour business model. The risks, and the actions taken to mitigate them, are described in the \nRisk report on pages 62-69.\nWe assess our prospects through our annual strategic and business planning process. \nThis process includes a review of assumptions made including market, vehicle and production \noutlooks, customer demand, underlying growth / cost assumptions, metal prices, key risks \nand opportunities as well as an appraisal of our strategy and significant capital investment \ndecisions. The Group Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer lead these reviews, \nalong with the Chief Executives of each business.\nThe Board also reviews each sector’s strategy throughout the year, looking at our current \nposition and prospects for the coming years. This allows us to reaffirm our overall strategy \nand reassess the risks that could impact its success.\nWe do not expect climate change risks to have a material near-term effect on our  \nforward-looking forecasts for going concern or viability. See scenarios opposite for more  \ndetails of our analysis.\nAnalysis through four stress scenarios\nIn making the viability assessment, we have analysed each of the principal risks facing the \ngroup – as described in the Risk report on pages 64 to 69 – and identified the items within \neach principal risk category that might significantly affect cash flow and viability. We have \nthen modelled these in four stress scenarios.\nScenario 1 – Maintaining competitive advantage of our products \nand operations\nThis scenario considers the failure to maintain our competitive advantage in existing markets, \nmostly because of poor execution of key initiatives or operations. It includes the effect of  \na six- month delay to key capital projects, delays to deliver the transformation savings and \na temporary one-month shutdown of a refinery, which leads to higher working capital \nand lower profits.\nScenario 2 – Geopolitical risks impacting JM’s operations\nThis scenario considers the increased risk presented by geopolitical risks, such as a one-year \nslowdown in our operations in China, and increased inflation across the period.\nScenario 3 – Disruption to the platinum group metals value chain\nThis scenario considers the failure to source sufficient metal to manage and satisfy our \ninternal and external obligations. We modelled a shortage in the supply of metal, an increase \nin individual metal prices to 12-month highs over the period April 2022 to March 2023 of our \nkey metals, and an increase in our metal holdings.\nScenario 4 – Other risks\nThis scenario includes the effect of all our other principal risks – outlined in the Risk report \non pages 64 to 69 where not already considered in the scenarios above. For each risk, \nwe have estimated a financial effect, which considers the impact and likelihood of the risk. \nGiven the wide range of risks we face, we have then applied an overall probability weighting \nof 20% which allows us to work out the potential financial impact.
