This document helps to add further detail to how assets have been \nmanaged in alignment with clients' stewardship and investment policies. For a segregated \nsovereign fixed income mandate, for example, the report may include portfolio-level \nanalysis showing MSCI ESG scores vs. the benchmark (standard and income adjusted), \nas well as analysis based on Ninety One’s own internal ESG scorecard and Net-Zero \nSovereign Index. The report may also include measures of portfolio climate-risk exposure \nat the country level, as well as an update on engagement activity that describes our \nstewardship work on behalf of our clients. \nHelping our clients transition towards more sustainable portfolios\nDuring the reporting period, we continued to respond to requests from our clients to \ntransition their investment portfolios towards more sustainable models. For example, \nsome of our European fixed income clients have asked for assistance in moving towards \na more comprehensive sustainable investment approach. In doing so, they also need to \nbe able to present to their own beneficiaries and stakeholders how they are meeting their \nsustainable objectives. In response, we prepared ‘Net-Zero Sovereign workshops’ for \nUK and Dutch institutional investors (the latter took place just after the reporting period \nended). The workshop were particularly aimed at clients seeking to bring their sovereign \ndebt portfolios within the scope of their net-zero targets (to date, most asset owners have \nexcluded sovereign exposure). The training events included sessions on the ASCOR tool, \nan investor-led project to assess countries on their progress managing the low-carbon \ntransition and the impacts of climate change, and on how our fixed income team uses the \nNinety One Net-zero Sovereign Index to measure countries against the Paris Agreement \nclimate goals.  \nIn addition, we brought ‘Transition School’ (see page 25) – set up initially for investment \nteams at Ninety One to equip them to identify and assess transition risks and opportunities \n– to a UK client. The all-day workshop covered a substantial part of the syllabus to address \nour client’s desire to improve its own staff members knowledge of climate investing.\n7. Signatories \nsystematically integrate \nstewardship and \ninvestment, including \nmaterial environmental, \nsocial and governance \nissues, and climate \nchange, to fulfil their \nresponsibilities.\nWe are active, long-term investors across all strategies, asset classes and regions. The \nmajority of holdings are held with a multi-year time horizon in mind. The time horizon over \nwhich we expect to meet performance objectives varies across investment teams.\nPlease refer to the Integration section of the report for information on how our various \ninvestment teams integrate ESG issues along with case studies showing how various \nissues are prioritised and assessed. This also includes examples of how considerations \ndiffer across asset classes and geographies. An example of the latter is highlighted in the \ndescription of the Emerging Markets Sustainable Blended Debt on page 28, which factors \nin the very different starting points, from a sustainability perspective, of emerging markets \nvs. developed markets by focusing on the trend in ESG factors, rather than absolute levels.\nPlease refer to principle 8, which outlines how our service providers support integration.\n8. Signatories monitor and \nhold to account managers \nand/or service providers.\nNinety One uses a range of external services and data providers to support ESG \nintegration. We assess providers on factors including how they address data \ninconsistency, scarcity and incompleteness, which are often obstacles to ESG integration. \nOur specialist teams monitor and review the market for ESG data providers, and we \ntypically formally review data vendors every three years. An assessment typically covers \nquality and type of data, coverage of investible universe, and cost. Vendors are evaluated \nfor data to support fundamental research and monitoring activities, and thematic data \n(e.g., climate data).\n90\nSustainability and Stewardship Report\nPrinciple Ninety One’s activities \n8. Signatories monitor and \nhold to account managers \nand/or service providers \n(continued). \nOur Sustainability and Investment Risk teams have update calls with service providers \nto discuss new requirements, improvements and gaps in datasets, and to understand or \nchallenge any changes in methodologies. \nThe ESG research and data that we have access to is integrated into investment research \nprocesses in various ways (depending on the strategy), including via scorecards and \nresearch dashboards. \nThe below chart summarises the primary ESG data sources that we use. Over the \nreporting period, service providers generally met our expectations. We have expanded \nthe ClarityAI data set in order to enable us to undertake climate-scenario analysis. Our \nprimary ESG data service provider remains MSCI; in a few instances in the year, we raised \nwith the vendor the issue of delayed updates to issuer data. We continually review our \nESG vendors to determine whether they remain best in class and fit Ninety One’s ongoing \nrequirements, as well as market developments.\nService provider How we use the data\nMSCI ESG Ratings, controversy flags, business-involvement screens.
