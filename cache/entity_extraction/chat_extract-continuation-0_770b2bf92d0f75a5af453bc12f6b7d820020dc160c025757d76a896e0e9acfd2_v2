It also discloses \nhow our decarbonization efforts have progressed since we joined the Net Zero Banking \nAlliance (NZBA) and made the net-zero commitment in 2021. We present our targets for \nthe power generation sector and the review of the thermal coal phase-out process.\nOur climate strategy is structured around risk management and governance processes, \nmarket standards and regulations based on a continuous improvement process. \nThe approach to climate strategy and achievement of net-zero by 2050 is based \non the understanding of our impacts and definition of the fundamentals of action \n(Understanding and Assessing to Apply).\nThis understanding of risks, opportunities and impacts is the basis for defining our \nmain targets, commitments and action plans, and was taken into account throughout \nall decarbonization target setting stages. Implementing our strategy involves getting \ndifferent stakeholders to engage in our climate transition actions and managing the risks, \nopportunities and impacts felt or caused by our businesses and operations.\nindependent assurance\nIn this report we present data regarding climate, emissions and overall eco-\nefficiency that has been assured in the scope of our ESG Report.

That’s \nwhy we aim to be the \nclimate transition bank \nfor our clients.\n6 \nItaú Unibanco Holding S.A.climate report 2022\nintroduction\nClimate transition represents a great opportunity to rethink \nthe 21th century economic model. We have the mission \nto achieve net-zero by 2050 to ensure we meet the Paris \nAgreement requirements and prevent the consequences of \nthe climate crisis. To this end, we must promote a transition \nto a low-carbon economy through a number of changes, \ninnovations, technologies and discoveries that must be \nintegrated into the means of production and consumption. \nGovernments, companies and people that are prepared for \nthis new environment will certainly be better positioned in \nthe new economy.\nFrom the moment we publish this report to 2050 there will \nbe great challenges to be overcome. According to the United \nNations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), \nin 2022 Earth’s temperature has already risen by 1.1°C from \npre-industrial levels. The stabilization of the greenhouse gas \nconcentration in the atmosphere is urgent. With respect to \nthe scenario in Brazil, decarbonization involves the reduction \nof emissions in a number of economic sectors. Important \nopportunities exist in Brazil in connection with the stimulus \nto a low-carbon economy, bioeconomy and conservation of \nour ecosystems. \nFinancial institutions are major allies when it comes to \ndecarbonization, since they have the potential to influence \nthe direction of financial flows by supporting green, positive \nimpact and low-carbon economic sectors. \nThe climate agenda will influence the financial system \nstrategy over years to come. As the largest bank in Latin \nAmerica and a pioneer of the ESG agenda, we aim to be the \nclimate transition bank for our clients. \nBeing the climate transition bank means not only endeavor \nall efforts possible to reduce our GHG emissions from \noperations and business, but also engage and support our \nclients in their decarbonization journeys. This can be done \nby providing products, services and advisory solutions \nto reduce risks and generate opportunities that reflect \nthis strategy in our business, loan portfolio management \nand services. \nClimate transition is not an \nagenda to restrict business \nbut rather one to foster the \nbuild-up of a more resilient and \nresponsible economy aligned \nwith global commitments. \n7 \nItaú Unibanco Holding S.A.climate report 2022\nStandards and initiatives we follow \nWe aim to align our strategy to top climate action standards and initiatives:\n • GHG Protocol_ In 2022 we were granted, for the 11th \nconsecutive time, the gold seal from the Brazilian GHG \nProtocol Program, which certifies organizations for the \nhigh quality of their emission inventories.  Our emissions \ndata is also available on the Public Emissions Registry. \nWe support the Commitment to Climate initiative, set up \nin 2017 as a multisector partnership and backed by the \ntechnical analysis of Instituto Ekos to select projects to \noffset emissions by using high integrity credits.\n • Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF)_ \nIn 2021 we joined PCAF, a global partnership of financial \ninstitutions focused on developing methodologies to \nmeasure financed and invested carbon emissions. PCAF \nwas founded in 2015 and in March 2023 it had already \nbeen joined by over 370 financial institutions around the \nworld. It is recommended by TCFD as a methodology to \nmeasure financed emissions in financial institutions.\n • C\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ITAÚ UNIBANCO HOLDING S.A.<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A major financial institution in Latin America, committed to climate transition, decarbonization, and supporting sustainable economic sectors through various strategies, standards, and initiatives, including the Net Zero Banking Alliance and PCAF.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARAGUAY<|>GEO<|>A country in South America, mentioned as part of the context of the report, possibly indicating the geographic scope or relevance of the bank's operations or climate impact.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNITED NATIONS INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE (IPCC)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An international body providing scientific assessments on climate change, cited in the report regarding global temperature rise and climate scenarios.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOVERNMENTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Collective entities responsible for policy-making and regulation, referenced as part of the broader context of climate transition and decarbonization efforts.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLIMATE TRANSITION<|>EVENT<|>A strategic shift towards a low-carbon economy, involving changes in policies, technologies, and practices to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, as emphasized by Itaú Unibanco's goals.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NET ZERO BY 2050<|>EVENT<|>A target set by Itaú Unibanco to achieve zero net greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2050, aligning with global climate commitments.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TCFD (Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An international organization providing recommendations for climate-related financial disclosures, which Itaú Unibanco follows for governance, strategy, and risk management.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOVERNANCE<|>EVENT<|>A component of the climate strategy involving organizational structures and processes to manage climate risks and opportunities.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STRATEGY<|>EVENT<|>A component of the climate strategy outlining the approach to decarbonization, risk management, and stakeholder engagement.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RISK MANAGEMENT<|>EVENT<|>A process within the climate strategy to identify, assess, and mitigate climate-related risks in the bank's operations and portfolio.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLIMATE METRICS AND TARGETS<|>EVENT<|>Specific measurable goals set by Itaú Unibanco to track progress in decarbonization and climate impact reduction.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NET ZERO BANKING ALLIANCE (NZBA)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An international alliance of financial institutions committed to aligning their portfolios with net-zero emissions by 2050, which Itaú Unibanco joined.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DECARBONIZATION<|>EVENT<|>The process of reducing carbon emissions across sectors, a central focus of the bank's climate strategy.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POWER GENERATION SECTOR<|>SECTOR<|>A key economic sector targeted for emissions reduction and decarbonization efforts by Itaú Unibanco.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THERMAL COAL PHASE-OUT<|>EVENT<|>A process of ending the use of thermal coal for energy, part of the bank's environmental targets.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EMISSIONS<|>GEO<|>Greenhouse gases released by economic activities, a primary focus of the bank's climate reporting and decarbonization efforts.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLIMATE STRATEGY<|>EVENT<|>The comprehensive plan outlined by Itaú Unibanco to address climate change through governance, risk management, and decarbonization initiatives.)\n##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
