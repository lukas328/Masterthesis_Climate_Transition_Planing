We have also won new contracts across our \nproducts business, most notably with our pharmaceutical and agro-chemical customers.\nFinancial performance in 2022/23\nOur financial performance for the year was in line with market expectations, albeit below the \nprior year. The three main factors driving performance were lower precious metal prices \n(c. £55 million impact), cost inflation (particularly energy, raw materials and labour) and \nweak automotive and truck end markets which continued to be impacted by supply chain \ndisruption. We experienced c. £150 million cost inflation, of which c. £95 million was \nrecovered from customers in the year. As we sharpened our commercial focus and took \naction to increase efficiency, the recovery rate improved through the year as expected. I am \npleased to confirm the total ordinary dividend will be 77.0 pence per share, maintained at the \nsame level as last year.\nFocus, simplify, execute\nOver the year, we have achieved significant commercial progress and now have in place an \ninternal commercial council to drive further progress across the company and create value for \nboth our customers and JM. We have introduced customer-centricity training for all our \nleaders to put the voice of the customer front and centre, and improved our customer survey \nand feedback process. We have invested in our sales teams and have built coordinated key \nglobal account teams to enable better synergies across JM. \nOur manufacturing and refining expansion activities are on track, particularly for PGMS \nand HT, as we made significant investments to not only increase capacity but create \nworld-class assets. This is really important as we are expecting strong growth for our \nbusinesses that catalyse the net zero transition, combined with higher recycling demand \nas we shift to a more circular economy. We have also invested significantly in our capital \nproject planning and engineering capabilities, which were identified last year as key enablers \nto help drive our strategy. \nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 202310\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION\nDetailed results \ncommentary online matthey.com/fy-22-23\nLast year, I also outlined how we would simplify to become more cost-efficient and less \nbureaucratic. We have accelerated our efforts to streamline our corporate cost base and real \nestate footprint. We are also simplifying our business processes, which includes a new finance \nshared service centre in Kuala Lumpur to service all our regions in a much more standardised \nand efficient manner. This all gives me confidence that we’re building a stronger, more resilient \nbusiness, fit for the future. \nSolid foundations for 2023/24\nThe global macro-economic situation remains challenging with continued high inflation, \nintermittent supply chain disruption and fluctuating metals pricing. But since we launched \nthe new strategy, our growth markets have been accelerating towards us at a much faster \npace than we anticipated even a year ago. This has been driven by energy-related challenges \nand subsequent regulatory changes, the most significant being the IRA in the US. \nBy incentivising the production of low carbon production technologies, the IRA has drawn \nmassive investment to the US and created a knock-on effect on green policy-making \nworldwide. In Europe, the EU has published the Green Deal Industrial Plan, the Net Zero Act \nand the Critical Raw Materials Act while the UK announced £20 billion of support for CCUS. \nThis is a pivotal moment for clean energy, and we are more than ready to seize the opportunity. \nOur customers tell us we have some of the best, and often the very best, technology available for \ntheir needs, and we continue to invest strongly in R&D to support our growth.\nGrowing responsibly \nAs we deliver against our strategy, it’s important we do so responsibly. We have made good \nprogress against our sustainability targets, and significantly increased our climate ambition to \nensure we are fully aligned with the 1.5 degree pathway to net zero. This year we were awarded \nthe EcoVadis platinum rating, putting us in the top one percentile of 90,000 companies. \nThis is great recognition of our commitments and the progress we’re making so far. \nOur people are at the heart of our plans. We recognised that employees were not immune \nto the cost-of-living crisis, so as a responsible employer we took steps to play our part. This \nincluded awarding pay increases, giving temporary supplementary allowances and providing \nsupport through Assist, giving our employees access to a team of highly trained and qualified \nprofessionals on a variety of financial well-being topics. \nWe are disappointed that our employee engagement scores did not improve this year, \nalthough this is perhaps to be expected given the degree of transformation the company \nis going through. We have increased the training and support to leadership teams to help \nthem build engagement, and we have revamped our performance management, reward \nand recognition schemes.\nWe continue to make safety our top priority, and improved safety leadership across all levels \nin the company. This has resulted in better occupational and process safety performance \ncompared to last year.\n \nDuring the year we welcomed three new members to our Group Leadership Team (GLT): \nAnne Chassagnette joined in May as our first Chief Sustainability Officer, and in July we \nwelcomed Anish Taneja as CEO for Clean Air and Mark Wilson as CEO for Hydrogen Technologies.  \nRon Gerrard, Chief EHS and Operations Officer retired in February, and I am very grateful \nto him for his service\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
