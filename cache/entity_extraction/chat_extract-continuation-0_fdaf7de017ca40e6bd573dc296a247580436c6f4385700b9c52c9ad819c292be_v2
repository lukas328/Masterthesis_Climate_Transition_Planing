Guidance on Use of Sectoral Pathways for Financial Institutions , June 2022.\n81 GFANZ recognizes that many entities are in the early stages of implementing their net-zero commitment and that it requires time \nto develop a credible net-zero transition plan. The focus of “aligning” is on progress toward full implementation of a net-zero \ntransition plan with an urgency on near-term action. GFANZ recognizes there is a gray area where entities may be committed and \ntaking significant steps in implementing but are still developing their net-zero transition plan. Disclosure from these entities will be \nessential to assessing progress as detailed in GFANZ’s Expectations for Real-economy Transition Plans , 2022.\n82 GFANZ. The Managed Phaseout of High-emitting Assets , June 2022, p. 28-29. Figure  11 in the cited report represents initial \nfeatures that companies of financial institutions may be expected to provide as part of their transition plans in reference to \nmanaged phaseout.  \n• Aligning: Financing or enabling entities \ncommitted to transitioning in line with 1.5 \ndegrees C-aligned pathways.  Actions under \nthis strategy should detail how the institutions \nidentify companies, assets, or projects in early \nstages of transition, beginning to transition, \nand advanced in transitioning. Actions should \ninclude adapting their product and services \nconsistent with this strategy; seeking new clients \nand portfolio companies willing to align their \nbusiness consistent with 1.5 degrees C sectoral \npathways;80 and integrating use of proceeds \nconcept. Institutions should consider defining \nconditions for determining whether net zero-\ncommitted entities who are developing a net-\nzero transition plan can be included as “aligning” \nfor internal purposes. 81\n• Managed phaseout: Financing or enabling  \nthe accelerated managed phaseout (e.g.,  \nearly retirement) of high-emitting physical \nassets. Actions under this strategy should \ninclude levers such as engaging with clients  \nand portfolio companies to identify \nopportunities to accelerate the phaseout,  \nand developing products and services to \nsupport an orderly phaseout. 82\nFOUNDATIONS\nCONTENTS  |  FINANCIAL INSTITUTION NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLANS — FUNDAMENTALS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND GUIDANCE\n32\nFigure 9.
