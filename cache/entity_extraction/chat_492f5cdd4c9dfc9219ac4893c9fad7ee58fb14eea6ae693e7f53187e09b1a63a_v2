Since then, initiatives to accomplish this \ngoal have been gaining momentum. In order to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions, Tokyo Gas plans to invest around \n¥2 trillion in growth areas including decarbonization, as well as proactively make use of transition finance for related \nfunding. Building on these plans, Tokyo Gas issued a transition bond in March 2022, becoming the first Japanese \nenergy company to do so. \n Through the issuing of a transition bond, Tokyo Gas communicated the importance of natural gas for the transition \nto a low-carbon society, as well as its own transition strategy, to financial markets and society as a whole. Mizuho, \nas the structuring agent, made use of extensive experience and strong stakeholder relationships to make proactive \nproposals and provide support. \n Going forward, Tokyo Gas expects to continue receiving proposals and support regarding financing (in cluding \ntransition finance) and making full use of new technology like hydrogen. \n(2) Fusion of decarbonized solutions and finance (Aeon Mall (Japan / Real Estate)) \nTo flesh out the process of switching to a 100% renewable electric power supply, \nproposals and discussions were held on multiple occasions regarding various options\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
