Another \nchallenge, as a bank with international operations, is to \nensure that the climate transition takes place quickly and \nequally in the regions where we operate, observing any legal \nbarriers and the principles of fair climate transition and \nintegrity of information. \nThis target will be reviewed every five years, in line with \nthe recommendations of NZBA, and our progress will be \nreported each year.\n7 The PCAF score ranges from 1 to 5. The closer the score to 1, the better the quality of the date reported. Public emissions inventory data, for example, in sustainability reports and in the Carbon \nDisclosure Project (CDP) were adopted on a preferential basis – PCAF score of 1. When it was not possible to access emissions that were directly reported by companies, we chose to calculate \nestimated emission data based on (i) production date – supplied by companies or based on production information, and (ii) average emissions factor – PCAF score 2.\n33 \nItaú Unibanco Holding S.A.climate report 2022\nDecarbonization of the Thermal Coal \nportfolio\nIn line with the scientific scenario of IPCC for the \nmaintenance of the increase of the Earth’s temperature by \nup to 1.5oC, we recognize energy transition from fossil \nfuel to renewable energy and low emission sources as \ncrucial for mitigating climate change. The demand for \nmineral coal grew 1.2% in the world in 2022 in accordance \nwith the International Energy Agency (IEA), exceeding 8 \nbillion metric tons, and most of this demand is used for the \ngeneration of thermoelectric energy.  According to IEA, coal \nrepresented around 36% of the power generation in the \nworld in 2021.\nThe main impact of the mineral coal with respect to other \ntypes of fossil fuel is the amount of greenhouse gases are \nemitted for the generation of the same amount of electricity. \nWhereas coal emits 270.9 tCO₂e/TJ for the power generation, \nfuel oil emits 203.6 tCO₂e/TJ, diesel oil emits 194.9 tCO₂e/\nTJ and the natural gas emits 124.6 tCO₂e/TJ, respectively, in \naccordance with the Energy Decennial Plan (PDE) 2030. \nThe Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) indicates \nthat phasing out highly carbon-intensive activities, such as \nthe case of thermal coal energy generation, is necessary for \nthe acceleration of the climate transition.  In this scenario, \nBrazil, in turn, distinguishes itself in terms of energy \ngeneration, with a matrix composed mainly of renewable \nsources.  In Brazil, according to the National Energy \nBalance (BEN) 2022, the installed capacity of this source \nis of only 1.7%, although in Latin America this percentage \ngrows to 5.1%.\nAs a Brazilian bank with a strong operation in Latin \nAmerica and global presence, we recognize our potential to \nencourage the energy transition and the use of renewable \nenergy in replacement of coal.  As a result, in 2023, we \nreviewed our commitment to promote the phase-out of \nthermal coal by 2030 and made it more ambitious. We \nunderstand that, although it encourages the transition \nto cleaner energy sources, the phase-out of carbon-\nintensive activities must be conducted in a responsible \nmanner so as to avoid undesired environmental, social or \nclimate consequences.  For this reason, we are committed \nto a gradual phase-out, contributing, most of all, to the \nachievement of a low-carbon economy.  \nThe restrictions, declared in our commitment, respect \nthe legal impositions that exist or come to exist in the \nregions where we operate and apply, initially, to thermal \ncoal, that is, assets or projects of coal-fired thermal power \nplants or projects of mineral coal extraction and dedicated \ninfrastructure.
