Catalyst Technologies has three key segments: industrial and consumer, \ntraditional fuels and sustainable solutions that help catalyse the transition to net zero. \nOur revenue streams include licensing and engineering income, first fill and refill catalysts. \nSales during the period were up 17%, with strong growth in licensing and growth in first fills \nand refills reflecting higher pricing and positive mix.\nIndustrial and consumer\nIndustrial and consumer includes our traditional syngas (methanol, ammonia and \nformaldehyde) catalyst offerings as well as the majority of our current licensing business. \nWe saw double digit sales growth reflecting strong growth in licensing and first fills as new \nplants came on stream following licence wins in recent years. In the year, we signed six new \nlicences (2021/22: three licences). Refills also grew well supported by growth in ammonia \nand formaldehyde.\nTraditional fuels\nTraditional fuels includes our refining additives, hydrogen and natural gas purification \nofferings. Growth in the segment was mainly driven by refills. High global demand \nfor liquified natural gas has led to strong sales of our natural gas purification catalysts. \nSustainable solutions\nSustainable solutions includes our new growth markets with our technology in low carbon \nhydrogen, sustainable fuels and low carbon solutions. In the period to May 2023, we won five \nlarge scale projects across low carbon hydrogen and sustainable fuels:\n• H2H Saltend, expected to be one of the UK’s largest low carbon hydrogen projects\n• A large scale low carbon hydrogen licence in North America\n• A sustainable fuels project with Strategic Biofuels, also in North America\n• A commercial scale sustainable fuels project in North America\n• A commercial scale sustainable fuels project in Europe\nIn addition, we won a low carbon solutions licence in the year which will enable the \ndecarbonisation of one of our customer’s existing assets.\nUnderlying operating profit\nUnderlying operating profit of £51 million was in line with the prior year and margins \ndeclined to 9.1%. However, we saw good improvement in operating margin from the first \nto the second half of the year (1H: 7.6% and 2H: 10.5%). Higher pricing, licensing and the \nbenefits of our transformation programme offset significant cost inflation and the loss \nof catalyst sales and higher margin licensing income in Russia (c. £10 million loss of profit). \nHydrogen Technologies\nSales more than doubled and continued investment to scale the business\n• Agreed strategic partnerships with Plug Power and Hystar\n• Sales more than doubled driven by higher volumes for new and existing customers in fuel \ncells, growth in electrolysers and increased manufacturing output as we focused \non improving operational performance\n• Underlying operating loss reflects continued investment to scale the business to meet \ndemand partly offset by higher volumes\nYear ended 31st March\n% change\n% change, \nconstant FX \nrates\n2023\n£ million\n2022 \n£ million\nSales\nHydrogen Technologies 55 25 +120 +112\nUnderlying operating loss (45) (33) n/a n/a\nUnderlying margin n/a n/a\nReported operating loss (46) (33)\nIn Hydrogen Technologies, we provide catalyst coated membranes that are critical \nperformance defining components of fuel cells and electrolysers.\nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 202358\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION\nFinancial performance review continued\nIn Hydrogen Technologies, sales in the year more than doubled to £55 million. This was \nprimarily driven by growth in fuel cells where we delivered higher commercial volumes \nfor new and existing customers, enabled by improved operational performance. We continue \nto focus our fuel cell business towards strategic customers to develop deeper and longer \nrelationships. This trend will continue given the recent strategic partnership announcements, \nfor example with Plug Power which entails a long-term supply agreement, joint development \nagreement and co-investment into new manufacturing capacity. In electrolysers, we \nsaw higher sales from the supply of samples, prototypes and components as we develop \nstrategic partners. \nIn the year, we saw higher manufacturing output as we focused on operational performance \nto improve our processes and drive efficiency. Sales also benefited as constraints eased \nfollowing the greater use of capacity in the prior period to qualify new customer products.\nUnderlying operating loss\nUnderlying operating loss of £45 million primarily reflects increased investment into product \ndevelopment and building capability as we scale the business to meet customer demand, \npartly offset by higher volumes.\nValue Businesses\nComparable performance materially improved\n• Market recovery and structural improvements driving improved performance\n• Completed the sale of Piezo Products, part of Medical Device Components, and agreed the \nsale of Diagnostic Services with completion expected in the third quarter of calendar 2023\nYear ended 31st March\n% change\n% change, \nconstant FX \nrates\n2023\n£ million\n2022 \n£ million\nSales\nValue Businesses¹ 470 354 +33 +28\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CATALYST TECHNOLOGIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Catalyst Technologies is a company focused on decarbonisation of chemical and fuels value chains, with key segments including industrial and consumer, traditional fuels, and sustainable solutions.
