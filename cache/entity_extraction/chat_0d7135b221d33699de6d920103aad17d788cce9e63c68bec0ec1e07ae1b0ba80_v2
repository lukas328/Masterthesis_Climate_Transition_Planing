Some of our initiatives will deliver benefit in \nthe short to medium term, whereas others will require \nlong-term effort to drive improvement. Some actions \ntaken include the launch of reverse mentoring and \nsponsorship programmes, setting diversity targets to \ndrive local leadership accountability, and implementing \ngender balanced recruitment panels and candidate \nshortlisting for all senior roles. We have also launched \nour Global Womenâ€™s Leadership Network - Dora Livock \n- to support women to advance to leadership positions \nacross the organisation. \nFor more details regarding our commitment to improving \nfemale representation and our work on inclusive practices, \nplease see our UK Gender Pay Gap Report found here. \n1. Final 2022 figures for ELA are not yet available for reporting. \nBusiness ethics \nThe high standards of ethical behaviour we expect from \nour people are outlined in the Bupa Code. Alongside \nour values, the Code acts as a moral compass for \neveryone that works at Bupa. It gives us a simple \ndecision-making framework to help us do the right \nthing by our people, customers, residents and patients. \nIt also displays our commitment to being a responsible \nbusiness. In 2022, we reviewed and updated the Bupa \nCode, rolling the refreshed version out globally across \nour businesses and integrating it into local policies and \ncodes, mandatory training, people processes, including \ninductions, performance and reward, and internal \ncommunications. Mandatory training is required to be \nundertaken by all our people, including contractors, \ncovering ethics issues such as Anti-Bribery and \nCorruption, Information Security, Health and Safety \nand Risk Management. More information about the \nBupa Code can be found here. \nOne aspect of our approach to business ethics is \nillustrated by our controls against financial crime. We \ntake active steps to ensure that our business, people \nand customers are not victims of financial crime. We \nstrive to limit the impact of fraud, whether committed \nagainst Bupa, our customers or the wider communities \nwe serve. The Bupa Code is directly relevant to financial \ncrime risk management at Bupa. The Code is \nunderpinned by Bupaâ€™s Enterprise Policy on financial \ncrime, applicable across the Group, which articulates \nour approach to preventing money laundering, bribery \nand corruption, breaches of economic sanctions, tax \nevasion offences and fraud. The Policy is supplemented \nby mandatory controls (such as due diligence, training \nand awareness and Know Your Customer), oversight \nand assurance testing, detailed guidance on \nexpectations and specialist resources, acting as subject \nmatter experts. The Bupa Enterprise Risk Committee \noversees the management of all risk types across Bupa, \nincluding financial crime risk and other risks relating to \nbusiness ethics.
