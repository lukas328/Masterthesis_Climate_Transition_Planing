the Consolidated Financial Statements \ncontinued \nUnderlying profit \nA key performance measure of operating segments utilised by the Group is underlying profit. This measurement \nbasis distinguishes underlying profit from other constituents of the IFRS reported profit before taxation, not \ndirectly related to the trading performance of the business. Updates have been made to the definition of \nunderlying profit in 2022 due to the Australian Government announcement on the deregulation of bed licences and \nas a result of Türkiye becoming a hyperinflationary economy in 2022. \nThe Group holds £50m (2021: £83m) of bed licences within Bupa Villages and Aged Care Australia. In September \n2021, following the Australian Government's announcement of the deregulation of bed licences from 1 July 2024, \nthe Group reviewed the amortisation term and updated them from having an indefinite useful life to being \namortised over the period to 1 July 2024. From 2022, bed licence amortisation has been removed from underlying \nprofit as it is not considered to relate directly to the trading performance of the business. \nThe impacts of applying IAS 29 have also been removed from underlying profit as this is how the Group measures \nthe performance of the business. These impacts have been recognised within the realised and unrealised foreign \nexchange gains/losses category below. \nThe following items are excluded from underlying profit: \n▪ Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets arising on business combinations – these impairments are not \nconsidered to be reflective of the in-year trading performance of the business. \n▪ Net gains/losses on disposal of businesses and transaction costs on business combinations – gains/losses on \ndisposal of businesses that are material and one-off in nature to the reportable segment are not considered part \nof the continuing business. Transaction costs that relate to material acquisitions or disposals are not related to \nthe ongoing trading performance of the business. \n▪ Net property revaluation gains/losses – short-term fluctuations which would distort underlying trading \nperformance. This includes unrealised gains or losses on investment properties, deficit on revaluations and \nimpairment losses. \n▪ Realised and unrealised foreign exchange gains/losses – fluctuations outside of management control, which \nwould distort underlying trading performance. This includes the net impact of applying hyperinflationary \naccounting. \n▪ Gains/losses on return-seeking assets, net of hedging – fluctuations on investments that are not considered to be \ndirectly related to underlying trading performance. \n▪ Amortisation of bed licences – Following the Australian Government's announcement of the deregulation of bed \nlicences from 1 July 2024, their amortisation term was reviewed and updated from having an indefinite useful life \nto amortising over the period to 1 July 2024. The impact of this is not considered reflective of the trading \nperformance of the business. \n▪ Other Market Unit/Group non-underlying items – includes items that are considered material to the reportable \nsegment or Group and are not reflective of ongoing trading performance. This includes items such as \nrestructuring costs and profit or loss amounts related to changes to strategic investments. \nThe total underlying profit of the reportable segments is reconciled below
