The governance and many of \nthe oversight activities performed by a company’s \nshareholders are instead performed by the AMs, who \nexercise their voting rights at general meetings of the \nCompany. For more information, see the Section 172 \nstatement on page 36. \nThe Board is ultimately responsible for establishing \nand monitoring Bupa’s system of governance, risk \nmanagement and internal control, and setting \nassociated policies for implementation by management. \nBupa’s governance structure is designed to enable \nthe Board to lead within a framework of prudent and \neffective controls which enables risks to be assessed \nand managed. The Board retains ultimate responsibility \nfor risk management; however, detailed oversight is \ndesignated to the Audit Committee and the Risk \nCommittee in line with their terms of reference. See \ntheir reports on pages 67 and 73 respectively for more \ninformation on their role and activities during the year. \nRisk Management Framework \nOur system of governance includes a Risk Management \nFramework (RMF) implemented using a ‘three lines’ \napproach, which is overseen by the Board and its \nCommittees. In addition, the External Auditor provides \nfurther assurance to the Audit Committee and the \nBoard in relation to the Group’s financial statements. \nThe RMF seeks to ensure that: \n▪ Appropriate governance arrangements are in place. \n▪ There are clear and established risk appetites in key \nareas of risk and opportunity within which the \nbusiness operates. \n▪ Risk management processes are in place to identify, \nassess, monitor, manage and report risks. \n▪ Effective controls are implemented and monitored \nto reduce risk exposure. \n▪ Documentation is maintained for key processes, \nkey controls and responsibilities. \n▪ Risk management information is used to make \neffective decisions across the business. \nThis includes identifying emerging risks and \nclimate-related risks and understanding their \npotential consequences. \nThree lines model \nFirst-line accountability \nAll our people are responsible for managing risk and \nensuring compliance with relevant laws, regulation, \nbest practice and Bupa policies and processes within \ntheir role. This ranges from care home employees \nfollowing procedures to keep our residents safe to \nsenior managers ensuring that they have appropriate \nand up-to-date policies and procedures in place in their \nareas and that their people are following these and \nreporting any breaches or incidents quickly and fully. \nDuring 2022, we began a process to enhance first-line \naccountability through the establishment of the Group-\nwide Integrated Management System (IMS) referenced \non page 8. This aims to link policies and procedures, \nunderlying processes and staff roles in a way that drives \nstandardisation and reinforces accountabilities. \nTo help our people understand their responsibilities, \nwe have the Bupa Code (which was refreshed during \n2022 – see more information on page 34), mandatory \ntraining on key topics, and role-specific training for \nfrontline people. We also undertake regular internal \ncommunications campaigns on key issues to maintain \nawareness and share relevant information. Each \nBusiness Unit sets target risk outcomes for the year, \nwhich are reviewed and agreed with Market Unit \nmanagement and Group management risk committees. \nThese are subsequently monitored by local \nmanagement and the outcomes reported to the Risk \nCommittee. Enterprise Risk Policy owners in the first \nline of defence carry out continuous monitoring of \ncompliance with our Enterprise Risk Policies and their \nassessment is challenged by the second line (risk, \ncompliance and clinical governance) and third line \n(internal audit). \nSecond-line assurance – Risk, compliance \nand clinical governance \nThe CRO leads the Risk Function and reports to the \nGroup CEO. The CRO has unfettered access to the \nChairman and to the Chair of the Risk Committee, which \nhas responsibility for approving the appointment (and \nremoval) of the CRO. The Risk Function operates across \nthe Group and each Market Unit has a chief risk officer. \nIn 2022, the Clinical Governance Function moved from \nthe leadership of the CMO to report to the Group CRO \nto better align with the Group strategy and the links \nbetween our insurance and provision businesses. \nThe Risk Function is responsible for the consolidation \nof risks across Bupa and reporting them to \nmanagement through the management-level Bupa \nEnterprise Risk Committee, and to the Risk Committee. \nIt has established the principles and framework that \nsupport the processes and procedures to identify, \nassess, manage, monitor and report risks to which \nthe Group is, or might be, exposed. \nThe Function provides independent oversight and
