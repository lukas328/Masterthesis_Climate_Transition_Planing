Summary for Policymakers , 2018, p. 24.\nGovernments and private-sector firms around   \nthe world have committed to achieving net zero \nwith the goal of limiting global warming to   \n1.5 degrees C. Nearly 200 countries signed the \nGlasgow Climate Pact 2021, through which they \nresolved to “pursue efforts to limit the temperature \nincrease to [1.5 degrees C].” 21 At the time of writing, \n137 countries, representing 91% of global GDP, have \nmade a net-zero commitment commitment along \nwith thousands of companies, cities, regions, and \nother organizations. 22\nThese efforts are driven by the growing \nunderstanding of climate impacts. The latest \nassessment report from the IPCC highlights that, \nto date, climate change “has caused widespread \nadverse impacts and related losses and damages   \nto nature and people,” and that projected “mid- and \nlong-term impacts are up to multiple times higher \nthan currently observed.” 23 This includes substantial \nrisks to human health, cities, infrastructure, \necosystems, food production, and water availability, \nand is projected to cause significant increases in \ndisplacement and premature deaths, in addition \nto significant economic damages. The IPCC \nreport states that “near-term actions that limit \nglobal warming to close to 1.5 degrees C would \nsubstantially reduce projected losses and damages \nrelated to climate change in human systems and \necosystems, compared to higher warming levels.” 24  \nNet zero: This term refers to a state when \nanthropogenic emissions of greenhouse \ngases to the atmosphere are balanced by \nanthropogenic removals. Organizations are \nconsidered to have reached a state of net zero \nwhen they reduce their GHG emissions following \nscience-based pathways, with any remaining \nGHG emissions attributable to that organization \nbeing fully neutralized by like-for-like removals \nexclusively claimed by that organization, either \nwithin the value chain or through purchase of \nvalid offset credits. 25 \n \n1.5 degrees C-aligned pathway: A pathway \nof emissions of greenhouse gases and other \nclimate forcers that provides an approximately \none-in-two to two-in-three chance, given current \nknowledge of the climate response, of global \nwarming either remaining below 1.5 degrees C \nor returning to 1.5 degrees C by around 2100 \nfollowing an overshoot.26 Pathways giving at least \n50% probability based on current knowledge \nof limiting global warming to below 1.5 degrees \nC are classified as “no overshoot,” while those \nlimiting warming to below 1.6 degrees C and \nreturning to 1.5 degrees C by 2100 are classified \nas 1.5 degrees C “low overshoot.”27\nCONTENTS  |  FINANCIAL INSTITUTION NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLANS — FUNDAMENTALS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND GUIDANCE\n3\nTCFD has stated “transitioning to a lower-carbon \neconomy may entail extensive policy, legal, \ntechnology, and market changes” and further that \nthe nature and speed of the transition may pose \nvarying levels of financial risk to organizations”. 28 \nIn its April\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
