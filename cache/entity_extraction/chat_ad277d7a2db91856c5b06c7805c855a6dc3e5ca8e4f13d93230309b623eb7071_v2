Whilst inflation rates \nhave declined in recent months, reported \nconsumer price inflation was at 64.3% in \nDecember 2022. \nTürkiye has been designated a hyperinflationary \neconomy for the year ended 31 December 2022. \nThis requires the Group to apply IAS 29, \nFinancial Reporting in Hyperinflationary \nEconomies. No prior year restatement is required \nwhen applying IAS 29 at the Group level, but the \nrequirement to restate current period results and \nnon-monetary balances to the purchasing power \nat the reporting date applies and will continue \nuntil such time as Türkiye is no longer considered \nhyperinflationary. \nThe application of IAS 29 involves complexity \nand has a material impact on the financial \nstatements. \nFor the application of IAS 29 - Financial reporting \nin hyperinflationary economies, we have \nperformed the following procedures: \n▪ Assessed the appropriateness of non-monetary \nitems to be indexed to the balance sheet date; \n▪ Recomputed the indexation of non-monetary \nitems from the date of inception to the balance \nsheet date, including obtaining the appropriate \nindexation factor from external sources; \n▪ Recomputed the indexation of the income \nstatement to the balance sheet date; \n▪ Calculated the gain or loss on the net monetary \nposition; \n▪ Verified the foreign exchange translation using \nthe exchange rate at the balance sheet date, as \nopposed to historic, average, or closing rates; \n▪ Assessed whether the application of IAS 29 has \nbeen disclosed in accordance with the \nrequirements of the standard. \nBased on the procedures performed and the \nevidence obtained, we consider the application \nof IAS 29 to be appropriate. \nClassification, \nrecognition and \ndisclosure of \ncertain liabilities \nrelating to Isapre \nCruz Blanca \n(Group) \nRefer to the Audit \nCommittee \nReport and Note \n28 (for \naccounting policy \nand financial \ndisclosures) \nIn December 2022, the Supreme Court in Chile \nissued a ruling that obliges Isapres to make use \nof a specific table of risk factors in determining \ninsurance premiums charged going forwards, \nand retrospectively over the previous 3 years. \nAny excess amount charged to customers is to \nbe returned.
