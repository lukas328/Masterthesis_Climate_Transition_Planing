BBVA will align its exposure to the oil & gas sector \nfollowing an absolute emissions metric. Between December 2021 and \nDecember 2030, the goal has been set to reduce emissions from its credit \nportfolio in exploration, drilling and extraction activities by 30% (from 14 \nmn t CO2e to 9.8 mn t CO2e) in accordance with the 2050 net zero \nemissions scenario, the most stringent scenario at this time (not to exceed \na 1.5ÂºC temperature increase in 2050). In addition, BBVA will not provide \nfinancing directly related to new exploration, drilling and extraction \nprojects in this industry.\nCustomers with an advanced level on transition12 represent 11% of BBVAâs \ndrawn amount in this industry. Therefore, BBVA will focus on engaging with \ncustomers with plans still pending to be elaborated to help them create \nrobust plans and set clear emission reduction targets. BBVA will also \nsupport these customers in their transition to other forms of low-carbon \npower generation\n through the necessary investments that will facilitate their \ndiversification and decarbonization.\nIt is important to note that progress towards our targets is expected to be \nnon-linear in the short term. \n12.
