BBVA will align its exposure to the oil & gas sector \nfollowing an absolute emissions metric. Between December 2021 and \nDecember 2030, the goal has been set to reduce emissions from its credit \nportfolio in exploration, drilling and extraction activities by 30% (from 14 \nmn t CO2e to 9.8 mn t CO2e) in accordance with the 2050 net zero \nemissions scenario, the most stringent scenario at this time (not to exceed \na 1.5ºC temperature increase in 2050). In addition, BBVA will not provide \nfinancing directly related to new exploration, drilling and extraction \nprojects in this industry.\nCustomers with an advanced level on transition12 represent 11% of BBVA’s \ndrawn amount in this industry. Therefore, BBVA will focus on engaging with \ncustomers with plans still pending to be elaborated to help them create \nrobust plans and set clear emission reduction targets. BBVA will also \nsupport these customers in their transition to other forms of low-carbon \npower generation\n through the necessary investments that will facilitate their \ndiversification and decarbonization.\nIt is important to note that progress towards our targets is expected to be \nnon-linear in the short term. \n12. Customers are considered to be advanced in their transition when they show a solid position according to internal \ntools such as the T ransition Risk indicator (TRi), including the definition of medium-term emission reduction targets, the \nidentification of reduction levers for the emissions management and the commitment of capital investments to execute its \ntransition plan and/or other internal evaluations based on the intensity of the customer’s emissions compared to its peers.\nP.  75\nBBVA Report on TCFD 2022\nThis English version is a translation of the original in Spanish for information purposes only.

Y ear \n2022 has been affected by the global energy crisis, exacerbated by special \nweather conditions with severe droughts, below average wind conditions, \nnuclear plants under maintenance and some coal plants fulfilling gas fired \nplants gap. \nBBVA’s performance has been actively driven by putting the focus mainly \non customers with an advanced level on transition13 which represent 83% \nof the total commitment amount.
