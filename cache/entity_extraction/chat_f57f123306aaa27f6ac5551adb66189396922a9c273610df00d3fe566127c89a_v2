Property & Casualty Insurance \n \nFor our Property & Casualty (P&C) insurance portfolio, we have committed to reduce GHG emissions to net-\nzero by 2050.  \n \nOur inaugural 2030 targets, released for the first time as part of this Transition Plan, focus on two core \nportfolios within our book:  \n1. Corporate, which is managed by Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty (AGCS), and \n2. Motor Retail \nFor corporate, the targets are set for those companies for which greenhouse gas emissions data is \navailable. These targets represent roughly 16% of the Commercial segment premiums for which emission \naccounting methodologies are currently available15, and 33% of its estimated insurance- associated \nemissions.  \n \nTherefore, we focus on the highest-impact portfolio and target a reduction of -45% in emission intensity by \n2030 compared with our base year 2022.  \n \nAddressing the corporate portfolio with reported emissions allows for an effective partnership with clients \nand supports steering with focus. In parallel, we will further encourage more transparency and reporting \ngoing forward. To this end, we will follow through on our existing energy guidelines, engage the top 100 \nclients per year that do not yet disclose their emissions, and work together with key clients in hard-to-abate \nsectors to foster knowledge exchange and arrive at emission reductions. \n \nIn addition,\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
