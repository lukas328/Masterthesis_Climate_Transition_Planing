With new leadership in place, a \nstrategic review is underway to drive the turnaround and growth of this \nbusiness. We added over 12,000 new customers to our new digital B2C \nsubscription product, the Bupa Smile Plan. \nUK Care Services delivered higher revenue due to the continued post-\npandemic recovery of occupancy levels, combined with higher income from \nboth private- and public-funded residents. This was largely offset by sector-\nwide staffing challenges, high energy costs and other inflationary pressures. \nWe continued to drive transformation through digital innovation in our sites \nincluding the rollout of an electronic care planning system which is now in \nplace across 10 Richmond Villages and 75 care homes. Closing occupancy \nrates increased to 87% (2021: 84%). \nIn Health Services, revenue increased from strong growth in health \nassessments, mental health and primary care services, and higher \ncustomer volumes in The Cromwell. We opened two new health \nclinics and reorganised our clinic network as we will end our franchise \narrangement with Spire Healthcare in 2023. The Cromwell saw an \nincrease in self-pay and international activity driven by complex \ncancer, transplant and cardiothoracic care. \n1.

In 2022, we focused \non three priorities: \n1. Enhancing our customer feedback \nprogramme (our NPS system), so we \ncan hear more from our customers \n2. Driving improvements in our \ncustomers’ experience \n3. Creating a truly customer-obsessed culture. \nThese are just a few examples of the changes \nwe ve made: \n▪ UK insurance customers can now get an \nappointment within 48 hours for prostate \ncancer symptoms. \n▪ In Australia we simplified communications \nrelating to annual price increases to make sure \ncustomers get clear, personalised information, \nand feel supported to make decisions. \n▪ In Spain patients can now track an ambulance \nin real time. \n▪ We ve launched a digital back pain prevention \nprogramme for customers in Poland. \n▪ Customers in Hong Kong can now chat with \nus and book appointments over WhatsApp. \n▪ Each of our 5,100 care home residents in \nAustralia has an electronic care record. \n▪ We have set up residents committees in all UK \ncare homes so residents can have a say in how \ntheir home is run. \nWe’ve broken our customer experience down into the \nmoments that matter most to our customers – we call \nthese 'micromoments'. At each micromoment, we listen \nto feedback from our customers to guide us in making \nchanges to better meet their needs. \nWe ended 2022 with 157 micromoments in place, \nmeaning we now have more opportunities than ever to \nhear customer feedback and make things better for our \ncustomers. In 2022, we sent over 25 million surveys and \nreceived nearly 3 million responses. \nWe have committed to making a minimum of 250 \nmeaningful improvements to our customers’ experience \nin each business each year. In 2022, we exceeded this \ntarget, making over 6,000 improvements globally, \nincluding 2,910 for insurance customers, 2,052 for \nhospitals, dental and clinics customers, and 1,115 for \nresidents in our care homes. \nOur customer-facing staff hear from our customers \nevery day and act on their feedback. However, ensuring \nthat all of our people listen to customers is at the heart \nof our strategy. We’re enabling all Bupa people around \nthe world to hear directly from customers, whatever \ntheir role, through our Customer Listening initiative. \nThis year we expanded the programme and it’s now \nlive in 11 countries. As a result, our people listened to \ncustomer feedback calls 53,000 times in 2022\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BUPA INSURANCE LIMITED<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Bupa Insurance Limited is a UK-based insurance company that underwrites both domestic and international insurance policies, with improved performance to 94% in 2021 from 97% in previous year)##\n(\"entity\"<|>UK<|>GEO<|>United Kingdom, where Bupa Insurance Limited is based and operates)##\n(\"entity\"<|>UK DENTAL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>UK Dental is a dental care provider experiencing increased losses due to sector-wide pressures, including a shortage of dentists and rising staff costs)##\n(\"entity\"<|>NHS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>National Health Service, the publicly funded healthcare system in the UK, which faces staffing shortages affecting dental services)##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUPA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Bupa is a global healthcare group providing health insurance, care services, and health assessments, with operations in multiple countries including the UK, Australia, and India)##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUPA ARABIA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Bupa Arabia is a healthcare company operating in Saudi Arabia, offering health insurance and related services, with a customer base of 3.4 million)##\n(\"entity\"<|>NIVA BUPA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Niva Bupa is an Indian health insurance company, part of Bupa, with over 8.4 million customers, focusing on health coverage and services)##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPIRE HEALTHCARE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Spire Healthcare is a UK-based private healthcare provider, with which Bupa plans to end a franchise arrangement in 2023)##\n(\"entity\"<|>RICHMOND VILLAGES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Richmond Villages are care homes in the UK where digital care planning systems have been implemented across 10 sites)##\n(\"entity\"<|>CARE HOMES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Care homes are residential facilities providing care services, with occupancy rates increasing to 87% in 2022)##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE CROMWELL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Cromwell is a health assessment and primary care facility in Bupa's health services, experiencing growth in health assessments and international activity)##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPHERE HEALTHCARE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Spire Healthcare is a healthcare provider in the UK, with which Bupa is ending a franchise arrangement in 2023)##\n(\"entity\"<|>CANCER TRANSPLANT<|>EVENT<|>A complex medical procedure involving cancer treatment, part of the services offered at The Cromwell and other clinics)##\n(\"entity\"<|>CARDIOTHORACIC CARE<|>EVENT<|>Specialized medical services for heart and chest conditions, provided at The Cromwell and other facilities)##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUPA ANNUAL REPORT 2022<|>EVENT<|>The annual financial and strategic report published by Bupa, summarizing performance and initiatives in 2022)##\n(\"entity\"<|>RICHMOND VILLAGES<|>GEO<|>A network of care homes in the UK where digital care systems are implemented)##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUSTRALIA<|>GEO<|>Country where Bupa operates care services and digital health programs, with residents and care facilities)##\n(\"entity\"<|>POLAND<|>GEO<|>Country where Bupa launched a digital back pain prevention program for customers)##\n(\"entity\"<|>HONG KONG<|>GEO<|>Country where customers can chat and book appointments via WhatsApp with Bupa services)##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPARE HEALTHCARE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Spire Healthcare, a UK private healthcare provider, with which Bupa plans to end a franchise arrangement in 2023)##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUPA<|>PERSON<|>Bupa is a global healthcare group aiming to be the most customer-centric healthcare company in the world, focusing on customer feedback and experience improvements)##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUPA LEADERSHIP<|>PERSON<|>Leadership team at Bupa overseeing strategic reviews, digital innovation, and customer experience initiatives)##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
