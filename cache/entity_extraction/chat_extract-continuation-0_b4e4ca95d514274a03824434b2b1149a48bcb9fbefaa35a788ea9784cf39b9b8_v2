Therefore, it presents a higher risk of \ncontributing to climate change, air pollution, and other environmental impacts. \nPolicies \n We do not provide financing or investment to companies with which we have no current credit transactions if the primary \nbusiness of these companies is coal-fired power generation. \n We do not provide financing or investment which will be used for new construction of coal-fired power plants or the \nexpansion of existing facilities. \n However, we will also continue to support development of innovative, clean, and also efficient next-generation technology \nthat will contribute to the expansion of sustainable energy, as well as other initiatives for the transition to a low -carbon \nsociety. \n \n3) Thermal coal mining \nRisks that we should recognize \n The mining of thermal coal, when not managed properly, entails the risk of adverse environmental and social impacts, \nwhich may include damage to ecosystems from hazardous waste produced in coal mines, as well as deaths or injuries \nresulting from mining accidents. Further, mined coal may also increase greenhouse gas emissions when burned for \npower generation or other purposes in the future. \nPolicies \n Our decisions regarding financing and investment for thermal coal mining companies involve a thorough examination of \ndue care to the status of responses to the above risks. \n We do not provide financing or investment to companies with which we have no current credit transactions if the primary \nbusiness of these companies is the mining of thermal coal. \n We do not provide financing or investment which will be used for new thermal coal mining projects or for expansion of \nexisting projects. \n For cases where it will be used to obtain the rights to an existing thermal coal mining project, we may provide financing or \ninvestment for the project, based on careful consideration, onl y when it is vital to the stable energy supply of a country \nwhich has announced a target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. \n \n4) Oil and gas \nRisks that we should recognize \n Oil and gas extraction and pipeline entail the risk of adverse environmental and social impacts, which may include the \npollution of oceans and waterways from oil spills or gas leaks, as well as violations of the human rights of indigenous \npeoples. \n In addition, pipeline projects have the risks of environmental degradation such as oil leaks not just during construction but \nin operation, deforestation, and violating the human rights of indigenous peoples. \n We recognize that the Arctic Circle (the region north of 66°33′ latitude) requires consideration for the conservation of \nendangered species and for the lives of indigenous peoples. We also recognize that oil sands, shale oil, and shale gas \ndevelopment causes significant environmental degradation and may violate the human rights of indigenous peoples, \namong other risks. \n Policies \n Our decisions regarding financing and investment for oil and gas projects involve a thorough examination of the impacts \n  \nTCFD Report 2022  -81- \n \non the environment and of the potential for conflicts with indigenous peoples or local communities.  \n When providing financing or investment that will be used for oil or gas extraction in the Arctic, oil sands, shale oil, and \nshale gas extraction, and pipeline, we carry out appropriate environmental and social risk assessments. \n \n5) Large-scale hydropower \nRisks that we should recognize \n Large-scale hydropower construction31 entails risk of adverse environmental and social impacts, which may include \ndisturbance of river basin ecosystems and destruction of biodiversity, as well as violation of the human rights of \nindigenous peoples and local communities due to resettlement. \nPolicies \n Our decisions regarding financing and investment for large-scale hydropower projects involve a thorough examination of \nthe impacts on the environment and of the potential for conflicts with indigenous peoples or local communities. \n When providing financing or investment for large-scale hydropower projects, we recommend the client perform an \nenvironmental and social impact assessment based on the Hydropower Sustainability Assessment Protocol. \n \n6) Large-scale agriculture \nRisks that we should recognize \n The development and operation of large-scale agriculture32 may entail environmental issues such as deforestation \n(including forest burning) and damage to biodiversity, in addition to potential human rights abuses such as the violation of \nindigenous peoples’ rights or the use of child labor. \nPolicies \n Our decisions regarding financing and investment for such agriculture involve a thorough examination of the client’s \nmeasures to address environmental and social issues. \n We will urge our clients in these sectors to respect Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC) in relation to local \ncommunities and to formulate sustainable environmental and human rights policy, such as No Deforestation, No Peat, \nand No Exploitation (NDPE). \n We will request our clients to strengthen supply chain management and traceability to ensure that the policy it has \ndeveloped will also apply to their supply chain. \n \n7) Palm oil \nRisks that we should recognize \n While palm oil is an essential commodity for maintaining our lifestyles and infrastructure, we are also aware of the risks of \npotential human rights abuses within the production process such as the violation of indigenous peoples’ rights or the use \nof child labor, in addition to environmental issues such as deforest ation (including forest burning) and damage to \nbiodiversity.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CLUSTER MUNITIONS<|><|>organization<|>Cluster munitions are explosive weapons
