There is, therefore, no subsequent reclassification of cumulative fair \nvalue gains and losses to profit or loss following disposal of the investments. \nThe group and parent company subsequently measure trade and other receivables and \ncontract receivables at amortised cost, with the exception of trade receivables that have been \ndesignated as at fair value through other comprehensive income because the group has \ncertain operations with business models to hold trade receivables for collection or sale. All \nother financial assets, including short-term receivables, are measured at amortised cost less \nany impairment provision. \nFor the impairment of trade and contract receivables, the group and parent company apply \nthe simplified approach permitted by IFRS 9, Financial Instruments, which requires expected \nlifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition. \nDerivative financial instruments \nThe group and parent company use derivative financial instruments, in particular forward \ncurrency contracts, currency swaps, interest rate swaps and commodity derivatives to manage \nthe financial risks associated with their underlying business activities and the financing of \nthose activities. The group and parent company do not undertake any speculative trading \nactivity in derivative financial instruments. \nDerivative financial instruments are measured at their fair value. Derivative financial \ninstruments may be designated at inception as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net \ninvestment hedges if appropriate. For currency swaps designated as instruments in cash \nflow or net investment hedging relationships, the impact from currency basis spreads is \nincluded in the hedge relationship and may be a source of ineffectiveness recognised in the \nincome statement.  \nDerivative financial instruments which are not designated as hedging instruments are \nclassified as at fair value through profit or loss, but are used to manage financial risk. Changes \nin the fair value of any derivative financial instruments that are not designated as, or are not \ndetermined to be, effective hedges are recognised immediately in the income statement. The \nvast majority of forward precious metal price contracts are entered into and held for the \nreceipt or delivery of precious metal and, therefore, are not recorded at fair value. \nCash flow hedges \nChanges in the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges \nare recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedges are effective. \nIneffective portions are recognised in the income statement immediately. If the hedged item \nresults in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, the amount previously recognised \nin other comprehensive income is transferred out of equity and included in the initial carrying \namount of the asset or liability. Otherwise, the amount previously recognised in other \ncomprehensive income is transferred to the income statement in the same period that the \nhedged item is recognised in the income statement. If the hedging instrument expires or is \nsold, terminated or exercised or the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, \namounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income remain in equity until the \nforecast transaction occurs. If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the \namounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the income \nstatement. If a forward precious metal price contract will be settled net in cash, it is designated \nand accounted for as a cash flow hedge. \nFair value hedges \nChanges in the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as fair value hedges \nare recognised in the income statement, together with the related changes in the fair value of \nthe hedged asset or liability. Fair value hedge accounting is discontinued if the hedging \ninstrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised or the hedge no longer meets the \ncriteria for hedge accounting. \nNet investment hedges \nFor hedges of net investments in foreign operations, the effective portion of the gain or loss on \nthe hedging instrument is recognised in other comprehensive income, while the ineffective \nportion is recognised in the income statement. Amounts taken to other comprehensive \nincome are reclassified from equity to the income statement when the foreign operations are \nsold or liquidated. \nFinancial liabilities \nBorrowings are measured at amortised cost. Those borrowings designated as being in fair \nvalue hedge relationships are remeasured for the fair value changes in respect of the hedged \nrisk with these changes recognised in the income statement. All other financial liabilities, \nincluding short-term payables, are measured at amortised cost. \nPrecious metal sale and repurchase agreements \nThe group and parent company undertake linked contracts to sell\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>JOHNSON MATTHEY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Johnson Matthey is a global specialty chemicals and sustainable technologies company that reports annually and manages financial instruments, investments, and derivatives as part of its operations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RUSSIA<|>GEO<|>Country where some cash and cash equivalents are restricted and held)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOUTH AFRICA<|>GEO<|>Country where previous year's restricted cash amounts were held)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Official financial report published by Johnson Matthey for the year 2023)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Category of financial assets and liabilities managed by Johnson Matthey, including investments, derivatives, and receivables)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Financial tools such as forward currency contracts, currency swaps, interest rate swaps, and commodity derivatives used to manage financial risks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FORWARD CURRENCY CONTRACTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Type of derivative used by Johnson Matthey to hedge currency risk)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CURRENCY SWAPS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Derivative used to manage currency exchange risk in Johnson Matthey's financial activities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTEREST RATE SWAPS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Derivative used by Johnson Matthey to hedge interest rate risk)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMMODITY DERIVATIVES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Derivatives used to manage commodity price risks in Johnson Matthey's operations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CASH FLOW HEDGES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hedging strategy where changes in derivative fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income to manage cash flow risks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FAIR VALUE HEDGES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hedging strategy where changes in derivative and hedged asset/liability are recognized in the income statement to manage fair value risks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NET INVESTMENT HEDGES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hedging strategy for foreign investments, with gains/losses recognized in other comprehensive income)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FINANCIAL LIABILITIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Liabilities such as borrowings and payables measured at amortised cost, with some designated for fair value hedging)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRECIOUS METAL SALE AND REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Contracts to sell and repurchase precious metals, used by Johnson Matthey in its trading and risk management activities)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
