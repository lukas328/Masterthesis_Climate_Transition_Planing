We have \ncontinued to screen our Scope 3 GHG emissions associated with our supply chain through the use of \nspend-based emissions factors (EPA EEIO). Since completing our first comprehensive screening inventory \nacross operations, supply chain and employee emissions for 2020, we expanded our review this year to \ninclude 2019 through 2021. \nEnergy Type GWh\nScope 1 - Energy Consumed 210\nNatural Gas 178\nLP Gas 1\nFuel Oil 0\nDiesel 32\nScope 2 - Energy Purchased 1,137\nElectricity 1,111\nDistrict Heating (Steam & Chilled Water) 26\nTotal Energy* 1,348\nTCFD REPORT 2022: CITIâS APPROACH TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND NET ZERO | 63\n2021 OPERATIONS, SUPPL Y CHAIN AND EMPLOYEE ACTIVITIES GHG SCREENING INVENTORY\nMILLIONS OF METRIC TONS CO2E (M MT CO2E)\n*Methodological Changes: \nScope 2: Changed from location-based emissions to market-based emissions to quantify the benefit of renewable electricity use. \nScope 3: The U.S. EPA updated their methodology for Scope 3 emissions factors resulting in a material change.   \nDemonstrating the magnitude of the EPA methodology change, the factor for plastic bags, films and sheets (e.g., credit \ncard production materials) increased 47% increasing Category 1 while the factor for computers (e.g., data center and other \ntechnology hardware) reduced 77% reducing Category 2 emissions.  Due to the significance of the change, Categories 1, 2 and \n4 have been re-calculated in their entirety to ensure meaningful comparisons.\n**Scope 1 includes real estate operations and corporate aviation. \n Throughout 2022, we have been developing our Net Zero Plan for our operations. As part of this progress, \nwe have determined to follow a 1.5Â°C pathway, which indicates that our operational emissions should be \nreduced by 4.2% per year , on average, from 2019 through 2030. Our renewable electricity use (Scope \n2) puts us well on the path for our operations (Scope 1 and 2). However , addressing supply chain and \nemployee activity emissions (Scope 3) remains a challenge in part due to data limitations. \nCiti intends to continue the steady progress we have made thus far , enabling real reductions in the near \nterm as we best determine how to approach the challenges of calculating Scope 3 GHG emissions and \nultimately driving real, quantifiable reductions across our supply chain and employee activity emissions. To \nthat end, we will continue to progress our operational efficiency and optimization efforts, our renewable \nelectricity use and seeking replacement or alternative low carbon fuel options (e.g., sustainable aviation \nfuel, renewable natural gas, etc.).\nCO2e Emissions Category 2019 2020* 2021 Primary Source \nof Emissions\nScope 1 (Direct Energy)** 0.03 0.02 0.05\nOperations\nScope 2 (Indirect Energy) 0.36 0.06 0.06\nScope 3 (Supply Chain and Employee Activity)\nSupply Chain\nCategory 1 â Purchased Goods and Services 1.63 1.54 1.70\nCategory 2 â Capital Goods 0.35 0.33 0.29\nCategory 3 â Fuel and Energy-Related Activities 0.17 0.13 0.28\nCategory 4 â Transportation and Distribution 0.15 0.10 0.11\nCategory 5 â Waste Generated in Operations 0.02 0.01 0.01\nCategory 6 â Business Travel: Total 0.13 0.02 0.01\nEmployee \nActivities\nCategory 7 â Employee Commuting: Total 0.08 0.10 0.11\n        Category 7 â Employee Commuting 0.00 0.03 0.03\n        Category 7 â Work from home n/a 0.07 0.08\nTotal Emissions 2.9 2.3 2.6\n64 | TCFD REPORT 2022: CITIâS APPROACH TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND NET ZERO\nAlthough Citi is working to support the transition, banks alone cannot drive this change, and the \nbroader private sector will need to more broadly engage to see meaningful progress. To efficiently and \neffectively harness the power of the market and to drive progress towards a low-carbon economy, the \navailability and quality of climate-related data needs to be improved, and the global community will need \nto continue to encourage meaningful climate regulation and governmental support and strengthen the \nmethodologies for assessing and mitigating climate risks. Additionally, Citi is focused on proactively \nbalancing support for our existing clients in the Energy and other sectors with scaling up investments in \ninnovative, low-carbon energy technologies and infrastructure as we spur progress towards global net \nzero goals. \nSome of the most important work to achieve a low-carbon economy will happen at the ground level. \nAs a result, our future climate efforts will focus on expanded and enhanced client engagement and \nfinancing efforts to provide our clients with the necessary tools and resources to establish their unique \ndecarbonization pathways and make progress towards their related targets and goals.\nIn the future, we also plan to continue, among other efforts:\n â¢ Developing emissions baselines and targets for additional sectors in our portfolio, such as Agriculture, \nAluminum, Aviation, Cement and Shipping;\n â¢ Continuing to measure\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
