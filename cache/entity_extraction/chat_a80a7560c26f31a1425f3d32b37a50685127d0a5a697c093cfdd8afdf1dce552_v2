This report is divided into three sections, i) my annual statement, ii) the Directors’ \nRemuneration Policy being put to shareholders at the 2023 Annual General Meeting, \nand iii) our Annual Report on remuneration for the year ended 31st March 2023.\nOur approach to remuneration\nOur overall purpose at Johnson Matthey is catalysing the net zero transition. We currently \nhave an important role to play in this process through the application of our sustainable \ntechnologies, products and services. We will have an increasingly important role to play \nas we further commercialise long-term sustainable technologies, including our portfolio \nof hydrogen technologies, that will enable decarbonisation and enhance circularity.\nThis year has been a year of progress in delivering on our strategy following the appointment \nof our current Chief Executive Officer, Liam Condon, in March 2022. We have simplified \nour portfolio of businesses and have also implemented a revised business reporting structure \nwith Catalyst Technologies and PGMS now identified separately and, in addition, we have \nstrengthened our senior leadership team. These changes, in conjunction with establishing \na higher performance culture, create a strong platform for delivering on our purpose \nand strategy.\nIn the context of the above, undertaking our triennial Directors’ Remuneration Policy review \nwas timely given the need to determine if our remuneration structures remained appropriate \nas we look to the future. In undertaking the review, we took feedback from both internal and \nexternal stakeholders, along with benchmarking our remuneration practices, and concluded \nthat the focus on long-term performance within our current remuneration policy remained \nappropriate to our purpose and strategy. As a result, the committee was comfortable \nretaining our current pay model and philosophy, and so the changes we are making are \nlimited to ensuring our performance metrics better align with our reinvigorated strategy \nand we simplify our approach where possible.\nOverview of company performance\nIn the face of a challenging environment brought on by political and economic uncertainty, \nour Chief Executive Officer and the senior leadership team have delivered a robust underlying \nfinancial performance and made good progress against our strategic milestones.\nDuring the year, Clean Air was impacted by automotive customers constraining their production \nvolumes, and PGMS was impacted by lower precious metal prices and lower refinery intake \nvolumes due to lower scrap levels with the semi-conductor chip shortage creating a buoyant \nsecond-hand car market. However, we’ve made good progress on our group transformation \nand cost reduction targets; have made excellent progress with Euro 7 business wins in Clean \nAir, and several new large-scale project wins in our Catalyst Technologies business.\nRemuneration Committee report\n“Our Directors’ \nRemuneration Policy has \nbeen designed to \nincentivise and reward for \ndelivering sustainable value \ncreation and long-term \ngrowth. This will be \nachieved through a \ncombination of business \ntransformation and \nstrategic execution all \nunderpinned by a high-\nperformance culture.”\nMembership\nAll six of our independent non-executive directors sit on the Remuneration Committee. \n Members’ attendance at committee meetings during the year is on page 75\nRegular attendees at committee meetings\n• Chief Executive Officer\n• Chief HR Officer\n• Group Total Reward, Wellbeing & People Services Director\n  The committee’s Terms of Reference set out its full responsibilities  \nmatthey.com/governance-framework\nKey activities during 2022/23:\n• Triennial review of the Directors’ Remuneration Policy\n• Reviewed our short and long-term incentives and their alignment to the company’s \nstrategy\n• Reviewed broader employee total reward, including pay equity and benchmarking\nOur focus areas for 2023/24:\n• Oversee the implementation of the new Directors’ Remuneration Policy\n• Set the incentive plan performance targets for the upcoming year\n• Continued focus on broader employee remuneration \nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 2023 103\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTSOTHER INFORMATION\nIn addition, in January 2023 we entered a long-term strategic partnership with Plug Power, \na leading provider of turnkey hydrogen solutions for the global green hydrogen economy, \nto accelerate the deployment of fuel cells and electrolysers (green hydrogen). This partnership \nis evidence of clear progress towards JM’s published milestone in Hydrogen Technologies and \nwill significantly contribute towards JM’s 2030 target for 50 million tonnes of GHG emissions\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
