For indirect impacts, we analyzed credit costs from business stagnation among our clients due to wind- \nand water-related damage. \n \nIn regard to chronic risks, we accounted for the rise in average temperatures causing increases in infectious disease (e.g. malaria, \ndengue) and heatstroke as well as for heatstroke prevention practices causing concomitant decreases in summer working hours \namong outdoor laborers.

Scenario analysis results \n(a) Acute risks \n Direct impacts \nWe based our analysis on the temperature rises considered in the Net Zero 2050 and Current Policies NGFS scenarios. Rising \nsea surface temperatures will lead to an increase in atmospheric moisture, and the st rength of typhoons that make landfall in \nJapan will increase. However, due to the smaller difference in sea and air temperatures, the convection currents (rising air currents) \nthat cause typhoons will be weaker, and the number/frequency of typhoons will de crease. As a result, even under the Current \nPolicies scenario which sees worse impacts, we have confirmed a total damage and credit cost of around ¥70 billion through 2100. \n \n Indirect impacts \nAs with the direct impacts, we based our analysis on the temperature rises considered in the Net Zero 2050 and Current Policies \nscenarios. In our previous analysis, we combined the credit cost ratio of a low credit rating to estimate credit costs as of 2050 for \ncompanies that were likely to see more days of business stagnation than the average. This time, we calculated credit costs through \n2100 based on how the number of days of business stagnation and the effect it has on corporate finance ( sales, business profit, \netc.) leads to credit ratings being lowered.  As a result, even under the Current Policies scenario which sees worse impacts, we \nhave confirmed a total credit cost of around ¥130 billion through 2100. \n \n(b) Chronic risks \nUsing the IPCC RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 scenarios, we analyz ed the change in infectious disease, heatstroke -related patient \nnumbers and deaths, and outdoor working hours under a global average temperature rise of 2°C or 4°C by 2100. We calculated  \nthe future impacts on GDP from the change these factors would cause in labor input and then estimated the impact on our credit \ncosts. As a result, we have confirmed total credit costs through 2100 would be limited to at most ¥4 billion. \n  \n  \nTCFD Report 2022  -47- \n \nFigure 12: Physical risk analysis process and results  \n
