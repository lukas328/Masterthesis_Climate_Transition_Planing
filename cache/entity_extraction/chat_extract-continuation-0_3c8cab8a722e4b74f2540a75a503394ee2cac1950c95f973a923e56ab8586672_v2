We consider the transition to a low \ncarbon economy to be essential and we engage constructively with \ntrade associations, policymakers and NGOs to shape the evolution of \nregulation and standards relating to climate risk and transition. From \na financing perspective, we are working bilaterally and multi-laterally \nto engage our stakeholders to support these journeys. This includes \nsupport on transitional finance for markets that are at a different \nstage of their journey from more developed markets.  \nWe believe that work on blended finance will be of increasing interest \nto policymakers in Asia and Africa in 2023 and beyond, and we will \nseek to build out our work in this area. In December 2022 we were \nannounced as the insurance partner on the private sector working \ngroup for Vietnam’s Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP), and we \nare proud to be supporting the country with their ambitious net zero \ntargets. We look forward to supporting the deepening of Vietnam’s \ncapital market, including the mobilisation of domestic finance for the \ncountry’s inclusive transition.\nFor a more comprehensive update on specific activities and initiatives \nrelating to our policy and regulatory engagement during the year, \nplease see our 2022 ESG Report. \nNet Zero Asset Owners Alliance\nIn 2021, Prudential joined the NZAOA – a network of institutional \ninvestors committed to the decarbonisation of their asset portfolios \n– to facilitate greater collaboration with global peers. As an active \nmember, and one of the only members with an emerging market \nfootprint, we support their wider policy and outreach work. \nIn 2022, Prudential’s continued focus has helped to ensure that \nemerging markets feature more prominently in NZAOA discussions, \nincluding a focus on the energy transition and climate solutions for \nemerging markets. In 2022, we supported specific NZAOA sub-tracks, \nincluding the Financing the Transition in Emerging Markets subtrack, \nwhich we initiated and lead. Within this subtrack, we started the \nEmerging Markets Transition Investment (EMTI) project, with the \nobjective of accelerating investment towards the net-zero transition \nof emerging markets. Full details of our involvement and progress in \n2022 can be found within our 2022 ESG Report. \nLooking ahead to 2023, we will be taking more of a leadership role \nin NZAOA’s emerging market thematic workstreams. In 2023, \nPrudential will be co-lead of the Financing Transition track, and \nwill take a more active role in this important area.  \n   Capital allocation and the bias against \ninvesting in emerging markets    \nPrudential’s ‘Supporting a Just and  Inclusive Transition’ \npaper highlights that current ESG investment frameworks can \nunintentionally create biases against investing in emerging \nmarkets. This is in part because companies and countries are \noften judged on their alignment to one global decarbonisation \npathway, which typically differentiates between sectors, but \nnot between countries or the state of economic development. \nAdditionally, companies within emerging markets are often \nmore carbon intensive, which may increase an investor’s carbon \nfootprint, even if that investment is used positively to finance \nthe energy transition. In the implementation of some \ndecarbonisation strategies this becomes apparent: the allocation \ntowards emerging markets is lower compared to the broader \nbenchmark. \nAs we also try to decarbonise our portfolio through capital \nallocation, we are actively monitoring to ensure we do not create \nthese biases in our portfolio. The set-up of our asset allocation \nprocess, which includes a regional allocation, reduces this risk. \n14\nPrudential plc Climate Transition Plan prudentialplc.com\nProducts and services \nAs part of our climate and overall business strategy, we are working \ntowards exploring more climate-related opportunities, particularly \nwith regards to new and existing products and services to support \nefforts to transition towards a net zero pathway. Climate change is \ncreating opportunities for new savings and insurance products:\n> New savings products could incorporate investment in green \nbonds, transition financing and adaptation financing; \n> New health and protection products need to reflect the impact \nof climate change on human health via changes in the frequency, \nseverity and emergence of certain diseases, such as the dengue \ncover we currently provide; and \n> Recognising that financial security at all levels is a climate \nadaptation measure, we are actively developing inclusive insurance \nproducts, which include  more products for underserved sections of \nthe market.\nDuring 2022, we established a new framework to classify ESG \ninvestments (figure 6) and intend to increasingly allocate Prudential \nassets to ESG- and UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)-\npromoted funds over time where we have mandate (ie, in our \ninvestment portfolio), subject to appropriate investment governance. \nThis builds upon our ESG screening process, for which Prudential has \nintegrated a minimum threshold on ESG into its investment \nmanagement agreements for mandates. \nFrom a climate change perspective, considerations for our products \nand services include: \n> Market and geographical relevance: Considering the \napplicability of the opportunity within an emerging market \ncontext.
