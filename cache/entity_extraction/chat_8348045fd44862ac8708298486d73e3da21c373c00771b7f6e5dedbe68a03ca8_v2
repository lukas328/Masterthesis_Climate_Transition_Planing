Appendix \nSource: Partnership for Carbon Accounting \nFinancials, The Global GHG Accounting & \nReporting Standard for the Financial Industry. \nCEO message\nOverview/Introduction\nGovernance\nStrategy\nRisk management\nMetrics and targets\nConclusion\nAppendix\n \n-70- Mizuho Financial Group \n \n \nProject finance \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAttribution factor \n Numerator: On-balance sheet loans from Mizuho to the project \nDenominator: Total project cost for each project (equity + debt) \n GHG emissions (project emissions) \n Project finance for power-generation projects: Estimated by multiplying the project’s annual power generation by the \npower generation emission factor from the IEA World Energy Outlook (calculated by region and sector) (equivalent to \nscore 3). \n Other project finance: Same as the above method for calculating corporate finance company emissions. \n \nb. Measurement process \nWe have measured emissions from corporate finance and project finance (other than for pow er generation projects) \nusing the following steps. \n \ni. Reconciling sector classifications \n To come up with usable data, we reconciled the sectors in Mizuho’s internal credit data (which are the same as in \nthe industry type classification established by the Bank of Japan), in the TCFD recommended disclosures (which \nhave no set classification method), and in the PCAF database (which applies multiple classifications, including the \nGlobal Industry Classification Standard (GICS), North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), and \nStatistical Classification of Economics Activities in the European Community (NACE, from the French abbreviation)). \nii. Organizing sectors subject to measurement \n Clients in sectors relevant to the recommended disclosures under the TCFD Recommendations 26 were subject to \nmeasurement, while others were outside the scope of measurement. \niii. Organizing Mizuho’s internal credit data \n We determined the parent company/subsidiary relationships for each individual client and organized them on a \ncase-by-case basis according to Mizuho’s business relationship with the parent company and subsidiaries and the \navailability of financial data and emissions data. \n We reconciled client data from data vendors with Mizuho’s internal credit data \niv. Calculating attribution factors and company emissions \n As on previous pages. \nv. Calculating financed emissions and data quality scores \n We combined the two to calculate financed emissions from all sectors subject to measurement. \n We weighted the average of the scores of the individual output data by the amount of lending by sector to calculate \nthe score for each sector. \n \n \n                                         \n26 For target sectors, see page 62. \nSource: Pa rtnership for Carbon Accounting \nFinancials, The Global GHG Accounting & \nReporting Standard for the Financial Industry. \n  \nTCFD Report 2022  -71- \n \nWe have measured emissions from project finance for power generation projects using the following steps.  \n \ni. Extracting the target of measurement \n We extracted project finance for power generation projects (thermal power generation, renewable energy, and  \nothers) from Mizuho’s internal credit data. \nii. Measuring project emissions \n Annual power generation: We employed internal data to calculate annual power generation per project, accounting \nfor power output and capacity factor. \n Emission factor by region and sector: We applied the region- and sector-specific emission factors from the IEA \nWorld Energy Outlook to the annual power generation per project above to calculate project emissions (equivalent \nto score 3). \niii. Measuring financed emissions \n We applied the attribution factor to measure financed emissions for all projects subject to measurement. \n \n(2) Issues and responses \nWe undertook measurement throughout FY2021 and in the process encountered a number of issues, which we attempted to \nresolve through trial-and-error as we came across them. Following are some specific examples. \n \na. Handling of consolidated and non-consolidated data \n Issue: Boundaries vary depending on the data set. For example, while data on GHG emissions, EVIC, and corporate \nvalue in company disclosures is frequently on a consolidated basis, Mizuho’ s internal credit data is on a non-\nconsolidated basis. Further, some clients in our financing and investment portfolio are subsidiaries in consolidated \ncorporate groups that only make financial and emissions data available on a consolidated basis, impeding correct \ncalculation of the attribution factor. There is a need to organize the approach to the numerator and denominator of the \nattribution factor and to the boundaries of company emissions in the measurement process. \n Response: We determined Mizuho’s business relationship with the parent company and subsidiaries for each individual \nclient in the credit data. When we had loans with both the parent company and subsidiary, we aggregated them under \nthe parent company’s consolidated data. When we had loans only with the subsidiary and emissions and financial data \nwere available on a non-consolidated basis or were available only for the parent company on a consolidated basis, we \norganized the data case-by-case. \n \nWe also considered that some clients may use different criteria for consolidating emissions data than they do for \nconsolidating financial data, but given the work involved in confirming the criteria for consolidation at ea ch individual \ncompany, we chose to assume that the criteria for both types of data were the same in carrying out our measurements.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
