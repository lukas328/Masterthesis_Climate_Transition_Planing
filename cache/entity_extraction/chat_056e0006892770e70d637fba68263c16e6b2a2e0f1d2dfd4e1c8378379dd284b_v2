Reasonable assurance is a high level of \nassurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will \nalways detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud \nor error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably \nbe expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these \nfinancial statements.\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non‑compliance with laws and regulations. \nWe design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material \nmisstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures \nare capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below.\nBased on our understanding of the group and industry, we identified that the principal risks \nof non‑compliance with laws and regulations related to international tax regulations, \nenvironmental regulations, health and safety regulations (EHS), and anti bribery and \ncorruption laws, and we considered the extent to which non‑compliance might have a \nmaterial effect on the financial statements. We also considered those laws and regulations \nthat have a direct impact on the financial statements such as the Companies Act 2006. \nWe evaluated management’s incentives and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation of \nthe financial statements (including the risk of override of controls), and determined that the \nprincipal risks were related to posting inappropriate journal entries, management bias in \naccounting estimates, expected credit losses, timing of recognition of litigation provisions \nand metal gains and losses. The group engagement team shared this risk assessment with the \ncomponent auditors so that they could include appropriate audit procedures in response to \nsuch risks in their work. Audit procedures performed by the group engagement team and/or \ncomponent auditors included:\n• Discussions with management, internal audit and the group’s legal advisors, and the head \nof ethics and compliance including consideration of known or suspected instances of \nnon‑compliance with laws and regulations and fraud;\n• Reading the minutes of board meetings and the Ethics Committee, and assessment of \n“SpeakUp” matters through the ethics reporting line and the results of management’s \ninvestigation into these matters (including engaging with our own forensics specialists \nwhere relevant);\n• Reviewing financial statement disclosures to supporting documentation to assess\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
