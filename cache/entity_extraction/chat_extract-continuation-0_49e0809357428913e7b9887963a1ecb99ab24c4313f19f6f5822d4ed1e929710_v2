The revenue from the Development \nbusiness is presented under Activity 3.1 bundled together \nwith Supply-only, which is in line with the presentation in Note \n1.2, page 85 in the Annual Report.\nThe revenue is separated based on a ratio derived from the \npricing of revenue in each contract type. The denominator \nincludes all revenue derived from both our segments: Power \nSolutions and Service, net of taxes and rebates, as defined \nunder article 2 point (5) of directive 2013/34/EU. The \nnumerator includes all revenue except that which results from \nthe Development business and Sale of spare parts as these \nactivities are not aligned for 2022.\nT o avoid double counting, we excluded non-aligned revenue \nfrom the total revenue when calculating the percentage of \naligned revenue.\nT axonomy-aligned OPEX\n94 percent of our operating expenditure (OPEX) is aligned  \nfor 2022. 23 percent of the aligned OPEX is related to  \nActivity 3.1, and 71 percent of the aligned OPEX is related  \nto Activity 7.6. \nThe aligned OPEX consists of expenditures relating to short \nterm leases, research and development costs not capitalised \nduring the year, building renovation measures and other direct \nexpenditures linked to service and operation of assets related \nto manufacturing, construction, and service.\nOPEX not T axonomy-aligned\n1 percent of our OPEX is eligible but not aligned as it relates to \nthe Development business and Sale of spare parts. \nThe remaining 5 percent of our OPEX is non-eligible as it is \nrelated to supporting administrative functions not directly \nlinked to our eligible business activities.\n Accounting principles - OPEX\nOur OPEX comprises 1) research and development costs \nnot capitalised during the year, and 2) distribution costs and \nadministration costs as specified in Note 1.3 on page 86 in \nthe Annual Report.\nThe definition of OPEX in the T axonomy is different from the \none used at Vestas. Following the definition of OPEX in Article \n8(2) of the Delegated Act, we have included all expenditures \nrelating to short term leases, repair and maintenance, research \nand development not capitalised during the year, building \nrenovation measures and other direct expenditures relating to \nservicing and operation of assets in our calculation of OPEX.\nThe denominator includes OPEX relating to eligible as well as \nnon-eligible activities. The numerator includes OPEX directly \nlinked to aligned business activities and therefore excludes \nany OPEX related to the Development business, Sale of spare \nparts, and support functions.\nSelected accounts that match the T axonomy definition \nof OPEX have been classified based on specific business \nactivities and summed up to calculate the numerator and the \ndenominator. Each account is added to the sum only once to \navoid double counting.\nIn 2022, the method to calculate eligible OPEX was changed. \nIn 2021, OPEX comprised all production cost, research and \ndevelopment cost, distribution cost and special items and \nadministration cost, excluding depreciation. In 2022, most \nproduction costs are not eligible as OPEX as per the definition \nof OPEX in Article 8(2) of the Delegated Act. The eligible \nOPEX for 2022 is based on selected accounts in production, \nresearch and development, and distribution cost.\nT axonomy-aligned CAPEX\n91 percent of our capital expenditure (CAPEX) is aligned \nfor 2022. All CAPEX relating to assets in manufacturing, \ntechnology, sales, and service is aligned. 72 percent of the \naligned CAPEX is related to Activity 3.1 and 19 percent of the \naligned CAPEX is related Activity 7.6.\nCAPEX not T axonomy-aligned\n7 percent of our CAPEX is eligible but not aligned as it stems \nfrom the Development business and Sale of spare parts. \nThe remaining 2 percent of our CAPEX is non-eligible as it is \nrelated to supporting administrative functions not directly \nlinked to our eligible business activities.\n Accounting principles - CAPEX\nVestas has fixed assets presented as Intangible assets \nand Property, Plant and Equipment in the Balance Sheet as \nspecified on page 75 in the Annual Report. Any additions to \nthese asset categories are considered as CAPEX. Refer to \naccounting policies in the Consolidated Financial Statements, \nNotes 3.1 on page 96 of the Annual Report for intangible \nassets and 3.2 on page 98 of the Annual Report for property, \nplant, and equipment.\nFor T axonomy reporting, the assets considered as CAPEX \nare: software, other intangible assets, development projects \nin progress, land and buildings, plant and machinery, other \nfixtures and fittings, tools and equipment in progress and \nright-of-use assets. Both cash and non-cash additions to \nthese assets are considered as CAPEX. The denominator \nincludes all CAPEX for the assets mentioned above. The \nnumerator includes CAPEX directly linked to aligned business \nactivities and therefore excludes any CAPEX related to the \nDevelopment business, Sale of spare parts, and assets owned \nby support functions.\nT o avoid\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SUPPLY-AND-INSTALLATION<|><|>PROJECT<|>A type of project involving supply and installation services, considered a performance obligation under IFRS 15, reported separately to reflect specific economic activity)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EPC<|><|>PROJECT<|>Engineering, Procurement, and Construction projects, bundled performance obligations, reported separately for accurate revenue recognition)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IFRS 15<|><|>EVENT<|>International Financial Reporting Standard 15, governing revenue recognition for performance obligations in contracts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEVELOPMENT<|><|>BUSINESS<|>Business segment focused on development activities, with revenue presented separately from other activities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POWER SOLUTIONS<|><|>ORGANIZATION<|>Business segment providing power-related products and services, including revenue from supply and service activities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SERVICE<|><|>ORGANIZATION<|>Business segment offering maintenance, support, and related services, contributing to revenue streams)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TAXONOMY<|><|>EVENT<|>Framework for reporting sustainable economic activities, used to classify revenue and expenses as aligned or non-aligned)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANNUAL REPORT<|><|>DOCUMENT<|>Official financial and operational report providing detailed information on revenue, expenses, and business activities for the year 2022)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARTICLE 8(2)<|><|>GEO<|>Legal provision defining criteria for eligible operational expenditure (OPEX) in taxonomy reporting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DIRECTIVE 2013/34/EU<|><|>GEO<|>European Union directive outlining financial reporting and disclosure requirements for companies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VESTAS<|><|>ORGANIZATION<|>Leading wind turbine manufacturer, involved in renewable energy projects, reporting aligned and non-aligned OPEX and CAPEX for 2022)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REVENUE<|><|>EVENT<|>Total income generated from sales and services, separated based on contract type and activity for accurate financial reporting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OPEX<|><|>EVENT<|>Operating expenditure, including research, development, and administrative costs, classified as aligned or non-aligned per taxonomy)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAPEX<|><|>EVENT<|>Capital expenditure on assets like property, plant, and equipment, with classification based on alignment to business activities)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUPPLY-AND-INSTALLATION<|>EPC<|>Both are project types involving supply and installation services, reported separately to reflect specific economic activities<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IFRS 15<|>REVENUE<|>Governs how revenue from performance obligations like supply and EPC projects is recognized<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEVELOPMENT<|>REVENUE<|>Development business revenue is reported separately from other activities<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>POWER SOLUTIONS<|>REVENUE<|>Power Solutions segment contributes to revenue from power-related products and services<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SERVICE<|>REVENUE<|>Service segment provides maintenance and support, generating revenue<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TAXONOMY<|>REVENUE<|>Used to classify revenue as aligned or non-aligned with sustainability criteria<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ANNUAL REPORT<|>REVENUE<|>Contains detailed financial data including revenue and expenses for 2022<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARTICLE 8(2)<|>OPEX<|>Defines criteria for eligible operational expenditure in taxonomy reporting<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DIRECTIVE 2013/34/EU<|>OPEX<|>Legal framework guiding financial disclosures and classification of expenses<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VESTAS<|>REVENUE<|>Vestas reports revenue, OPEX, and CAPEX aligned with taxonomy standards for 2022<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>REVENUE<|>OPEX<|>Operational expenses are deducted from revenue to determine profit, with classification into aligned and non-aligned categories<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>REVENUE<|>CAPEX<|>Capital expenditures are investments related to revenue-generating assets, classified based on alignment<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
