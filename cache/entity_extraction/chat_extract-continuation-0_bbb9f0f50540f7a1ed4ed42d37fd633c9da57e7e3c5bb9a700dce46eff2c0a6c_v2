An example is the variance \ntaxation assets between the carrying value of equipment due to depreciation being \ncharged for financial reporting purposes and written down allowances \nand liabilities being applied for the relevant tax authorities. \nDeferred taxation is recognised in full using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences \nbetween the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for \ntaxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not recognised: goodwill not deductible for taxation \npurposes and the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and \nwhich, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss. The amount \nof deferred taxation recognised is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying \namount of assets and liabilities, using taxation rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. \nA deferred taxation asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be \navailable against which the asset can be utilised. Deferred taxation assets and liabilities are offset when they relate \nto income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and when the Group can settle its current taxation assets \nand liabilities on a net basis. \nRecognised deferred taxation assets and liabilities \nDeferred taxation assets and liabilities are attributable to the following: \nAssets Liabilities Net \n2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021 \n£m £m £m £m £m £m \nAccelerated capital allowances 82 64 (38) (28) 44 36 \nPost-employment benefits 3 3 (131) (175) (128) (172) \nRevaluation of properties to fair value 1 2 (87) (104) (86) (102) \nEmployee benefits (other than post-employment) 61 55 – – 61 55 \nProvisions 152 145 (8) (8) 144 137 \nTaxation value of losses carried forward 63 63 – – 63 63 \nGoodwill and intangible assets 13 9 (136) (207) (123) (198) \nOther 17 14 (40) (39) (23) (25) \nDeferred taxation (before allowable netting) 392 355 (440) (561) (48) (206) \nAllowable netting of deferred taxation (263) (266) 263 266 – – \nDeferred taxation – net 129 89 (177) (295) (48) (206) \nUnrecognised deferred taxation assets \nAs at 31 December 2022, the Group had deductible temporary differences relating to trading losses of £190m \n(2021: £100m), to capital losses of £80m (2021: £69m), and to other temporary differences of £9m (2021: £nil) for \nwhich no deferred taxation asset was recognised due to uncertainty of utilisation of those temporary differences. \nBupa Annual Report 2022 165 \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n  \n                \n                 \n   \n                  \n   \n                 \n                \n    \n                 \n   \n                \n                \n                \n  \n                \n                 \n   \n                  \n   \n                 \n                \n    \n                 \n   \n                \n                \n                \n         \n          \n      \n   \nStrategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements \nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \ncontinued \nMovement in net deferred taxation (liabilities)/assets \nRecognised in Recognised in Acquisitions \nAt Initial Consolidated other through \nbeginning application Income comprehensive business Foreign At end \nof year of IAS 29¹ Statement income combinations Disposals exchange of year \n£m £m £m £m £m £m £m £m \n2022 \nAccelerated capital \nallowances 36 – 9 – (1) – – 44 \nPost-employment benefits (172) – (3) 47 – – – (128) \nRevaluation of properties \nto fair value (\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DERIVATIVES<|><|>ORGANIZATION<|>Financial derivatives such as currency forward contracts, swaps, and options are used by the Group to hedge financial risks, with their fair values determined using market observable data and interest rate yield curves.
