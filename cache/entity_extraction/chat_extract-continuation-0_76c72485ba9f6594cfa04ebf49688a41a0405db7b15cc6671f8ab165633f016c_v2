The majority of the deferred tax assets and liabilities noted above are \nanticipated to be realised after more than 12 months. \n24 Post-employment benefits \nGroup \nBackground \nPension plans \nThe group operates a number of post-employment retirement and medical benefit plans \naround the world. The retirement plans in the UK, US and other countries include both \ndefined contribution and defined benefit plans. \nFor defined contribution plans, retirement benefits are determined by the value of funds \narising from contributions paid in respect of each employee and the investment returns on \nthose contributions prior to retirement.  \nFor defined benefit plans, which include final salary, career average and other types of plans \nwith committed pension payments, the retirement benefits are based on factors, such as the \nemployee’s pensionable salary and length of service. The majority of the group’s final salary \nand career average defined benefit retirement plans are closed to new entrants but remain \nopen to ongoing accrual for current members. \nRegulatory framework and governance \nThe UK pension plan, the Johnson Matthey Employees’ Pension Scheme (JMEPS), is a \nregistered arrangement established under trust law and, as such, is subject to UK pension, tax \nand trust legislation. It is managed by a corporate trustee, JMEPS Trustees Limited. The trustee \nboard includes representatives appointed by both the parent company and employees and \nincludes an independent chairman. \nAlthough the parent company bears the financial cost of the plan, the trustee directors are \nresponsible for the overall management and governance of JMEPS, including compliance with \nall applicable legislation and regulations. The trustee directors are required by law to act in the \ninterests of all relevant beneficiaries and: to set certain policies; to manage the day-to-day \nadministration of the benefits; and to set the plan’s investment strategy following consultation \nwith the parent company. \nUK pensions are regulated by the Pensions Regulator whose statutory objectives and \nregulatory powers are described on its website: www.thepensionsregulator.gov.uk \nThe JMEPS Trustee Board considers how climate risk is integrated within investment processes \nwhen appointing, monitoring and withdrawing from investment managers using the \ninvestment consultant’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) ratings. The ESG ratings \ninclude consideration of climate risk management policies. On a periodic basis, JMEPS will \nreview the ESG ratings assigned to the underlying investments based on the investment \nconsultant’s ESG research. \nThe US pension plans are qualified pension arrangements and are subject to the requirements \nof the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, the Pension Protection Act 2006 and the \nDepartment of Labor and Internal Revenue. The plans are managed by a pension committee \nwhich acts as the fiduciary and, as such, is ultimately responsible for: the management of the \nplans’ investments; compliance with all applicable legislation and regulations; and overseeing \nthe general management of the plans. \nOther trustee or fiduciary arrangements that have similar responsibilities and obligations are \nin place for the group’s other funded defined benefit pension plans outside of the UK and US. \nBenefits \nThe UK defined benefit pension plan is segregated into two sections – a legacy section which \nprovides final salary and career average pension benefits and a cash balance section.  \nThe legacy section provides benefits to members in the form of a set level of pension payable \nfor life based on the member’s length of service and final pensionable salary at retirement or \naveraged over their career with the company. The majority of the benefits attract inflation-\nrelated increases both before and after retirement. The final salary element of the legacy \nsection was closed to future accrual of benefits from 1st April 2010 and the career average \nelement of the legacy section was closed to new entrants on 1st October 2012, but remains \nopen to future accrual for existing members. \nThe cash balance section provides benefits to members at the point of retirement in the form \nof a cash lump sum. The benefits attract inflation-related increases before retirement but, \nfollowing the payment of the retirement lump sum benefit, the plan has no obligation to pay \nany further benefits to the member. All new employees join the cash balance section of \nthe plan. \n  \nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 2023 183\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION\nNotes on the Accounts continued for the year ended 31st March 2023 \n184 \n24 Post-employment benefits continued \nGroup continued \nThe group operates two defined benefit pension plans in the US. The hourly pension plan is for \nunionised employees and provides a fixed retirement benefit for life based upon years of \nservice. The salaried pension plan provides retirement benefits for life based on the member’s \nlength of service and final pensionable salary (averaged over the last five years). The salaried \nplan benefits attract inflation-related increases before leaving but are non-increasing \nthereafter. On retirement, members in either plan have the option to take the cash value of \ntheir benefit instead of a lifetime annuity in which case the plan has no obligation to pay any \nfurther benefits to the member. \nThe US salaried pension plan was closed to new entrants on 1st September 2013, and the US \nhourly pension plan was closed to new entrants on 1st January 2019. The hourly pension plan \nremains open to future accrual for existing members but the salaried pension plan will be \nclosed to future accrual from 1st July 2023 with plan participants transferring to a defined \ncontribution plan.
