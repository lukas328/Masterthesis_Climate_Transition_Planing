Following our strategic review last year, global town halls were held across \nthe group to communicate our new strategy and business priorities. It was felt that this method of engagement \nwould be the most effective for this financial year to ensure that all colleagues had the opportunity to ask detailed \nquestions about the strategy, values and cultural ambition to the Group Leadership Team (GLT). We intend to \nresume our engagement focus groups in certain countries where JM has a significant footprint during 2023/24. \nThese focus groups will be attended by a non-executive director\n• provision 41– engagement with the workforce on alignment of executive pay with the wider company pay \npolicy: While we inform our employees of global changes to pay and benefits, we have not actively sought a \ntwo-way dialogue over executive pay. We benchmark remuneration against our peers to ensure we offer \ncompetitive pay and benefits, so we continue to attract and retain the highest-calibre candidates. During the \nyear, all employees were able to provide feedback on a range of matters, including remuneration, as part of our \nannual employee engagement survey.

We discussed, challenged and \nprovided feedback on the strategic review, and our revised strategy was announced in May \n2022. It followed a long and detailed process of reviewing our strengths, the markets in which \nwe operate, and getting feedback from our investors, customers and employees. Since then, \nthe Board has overseen the implementation and delivery of our strategy, which is underpinned \nby our transformation programme. As we move to a faster-paced, more customer-focused \nculture, we have approved key strategic partnerships, and won business and large-scale projects, \ndelivering against our promises for each of our businesses to accelerate our growth and drive \nvalue creation.\n  Read more about our strategy and progress against our milestones on pages 12 and 13 \nRead more about the Board’s activities during the year on pages 82 and 83\n“The Board’s debate and challenge supports the delivery \nof our strategy”\nGovernance highlights\n• Assessed and approved a refreshed group strategy \n• Monitored the transformation programme \n• Appointed Barbara Jeremiah as an independent non-executive director\n• Approved investments and strategic partnerships linked to our strategic milestones \n• Reviewed previous strategic decisions and evaluated the learnings to further \nimprove governance processes\nChair’s introduction\nSustainability is an integral part of Johnson Matthey and embedded into our strategy. We are committed \nto achieving net zero by 2040, and our progress against the 2030 targets (set out on page 24) is closely \nmonitored by the Societal Value Committee. We are on track for a reduction in scope 1+2 CO2e (carbon \ndioxide equivalent) emissions from a 2019/20 baseline. And through our products, we have continued \nto helped our customers reduce CO2e emissions.\n More information about our Societal Value Committee’s work is on page 88\nThe Audit Committee assessed JM’s readiness to implement recommendations from the \nDepartment for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) white paper on restoring trust in \naudit and corporate governance. This included reviewing our climate-related assurance processes \nand the creation of our sustainability assurance framework.\n More information about our Audit Committee’s work is on page 94\nDuring the year, we have continued to focus on succession planning, and the Nomination \nCommittee undertook a search for a new non-executive director. We look forward to welcoming \nBarbara Jeremiah to the Board in July 2023. Barbara’s appointment will further enhance our \nBoard’s skills and experience, and she will also take on the role of Senior Independent Director. \nFurther information on\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
