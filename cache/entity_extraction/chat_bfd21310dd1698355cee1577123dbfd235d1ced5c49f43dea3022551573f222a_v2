Further customer \neducation and engagement, as well as government policies, will support incentivising customer behaviour \nchange. To support this, NatWest Group is creating a one-stop portal where customers will be able to work out \nwhat they need to improve the energy efficiency of their home, find the finance and source a supplier.\n • Technology development and scaling: Heat pumps are considered to be more energy efficient than oil and \ngas boilers. However, installing heat pumps often involves high cost and future scalability to align with future \nincrease in demand.\n • Housing associations: While the social housing is considered to be ahead of the private sector when it comes \nto average EPC ratings, it still has a large number of properties that need to be improved. In England, there are \napproximately 4.1 million social homes and 1.6 million of these are below EPC C. The housing associations \nsector is highly regulated and while there is currently no legal requirement for the sector to deliver net zero, it is \nexpected that the majority of housing associations will reach EPC C by 2030 and net zero by 2050. In February \n2021, NatWest Group issued a €1 billion affordable housing social bond, the first of its kind by a UK bank. We \nselected a pool of loans to not-for-profit UK-based housing associations to which we will allocate funds. These \nhousing associations undertake social rent, affordable rent, supported housing and shared property schemes. In \ntotal, they own around 150,000 houses/flats. More broadly, NatWest Group has supported the work on the \nenhancement of the  Sustainability Reporting Standard for Social Housing. This framework is designed to enable \nhousing providers to report on their  ESG performance in a transparent, consistent and comparable manner.\n • Innovation in construction processes: there is potential to reduce onsite construction times through \ninnovative methods including modular construction methods as well as equipment that can reduce diesel \nconsumption of plant and machinery and saving of raw materials. However, where low carbon options are \navailable, the cost of this technology is currently multiple times more than conventional diesel. With tight \nmargins and inflationary pressures, this has the potential to slow down business investment in green assets. In \naddition, alternative materials used in the construction process must be capable of being supplied at scale while \nensuring essential safety standards are met. Promising materials include compressed laminate timber and zero \ncarbon cement. \nNatWest Group and our customers have a dependency on timely and appropriate government policies to support transition.\nNoted below are policies that are expected to the support decarbonisation of UK homes and buildings.\n34NatWest Group plc | 2022 Climate-related Disclosures Report\nGovernance Strategy and Climate transition plan Risk Management and Scenario Analysis Metrics and TargetsIntroduction\nMaking our homes more sustainable\nWith an ageing housing stock, improving the energy \nefficiency of homes in the UK could bring a range of \nenvironmental and social benefits – from reducing \ncarbon emissions to savings on heating bills – as well as \nbetter outcomes for our health and wellbeing.\nIn 2021, we launched the Sustainable Homes and \nBuildings Coalition with partners British Gas, Worcester \nBosch and Shelter to improve the energy efficiency of \nUK buildings. Together, we’re working to raise \nawareness of what the transition to net zero means for \nhomeowners and tenants by providing practical advice \nand support to make homes more sustainable.\nAs part of NatWest Group’s response, we established \nthe Greener Homes Attitude Tracker, a quarterly survey \nsupported by S&P Global. The tracker shows that while \nsupport for energy efficiency adoption is growing, cost \ncan be a significant barrier to many green home \nimprovements.\nThis was the experience of Coutts client Kay Hallinan, \nwho, despite adopting sustainable practices in her \nday-to-day life, had initially been put off by the high \ncosts associated with many green home improvements.\nIn 2020, Kay purchased an investment property for \nrenovation. After installing double glazing, replacing the \nboiler and switching to energy efficient lighting, the EPC \nrating for the property increased from F to C – securing \na discounted arrangement fee on Kay’s Coutts retrofit \nmortgage.\nOur residential and buy-to-let mortgage suite now \nincludes several options that incentivise customers \npurchasing an energy efficient home or renovating an \nexisting property to improve its energy performance \nwith lower interest rates and discounts. Since they were \nlaunched in Q4 2020, Retail Banking has completed  \n£2.9 billion of Green Mortgages(1).\n‘Although we were working towards an energy efficient \nhome for our tenants, we were not thinking about the \nEPC rating when we were renovating the property,’ \nsays Kay. ‘However, after receiving cashback on our \narrangement fee, I was able to consider where we could \neasily increase the EPC rating in other properties.’\nWith our Sustainable Homes and Building Coalition \npartners, we also launched the Green Homes Retrofit \nPilot, in collaboration with Quidos, which aims to support \na sample of customers seeking to improve the energy \nefficiency of their homes and reduce energy bills. At the \nend of 2022 nine customers were informing this pilot, \nwith works ranging from new double glazing to \nimproved insulation, solar panels, new radiators and \nheat pumps. Insights from the trial will be used to \ninnovate and develop our future product range.\nThrough collaborative initiatives, as well as innovative \nfeatures such as our Home Energy Plan – which shows \ncustomers up-to-date information on the EPC rating of \ntheir property and suggests helpful tips on green home \nimprovements – we can help more people make their \nhomes energy efficient.\nWe’re\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
