Through the \nbusiness and our production chain, we \nare in contact with suppliers, integrated \nproducers, clients, consumers, partners \nand organizations which assist the \ncompany in fulfillment of its reason for \nbeing and contribute to its evolution.\nOver recent years, we have been working \nhard to strengthen our ability to generate \nresults. We are on a learning journey \nto continue creating employment and \nincome, whilst incorporating good \npractices related to our commitments to \nIntegrity, Quality and Safety.\nThis chapter brings together indicators, \nprojects and examples that demonstrate \nhow we create and share value, starting \nwith the relations constructed by the \nCompany with the accessed capitals and \nthe publics we impact, covering economic, \nenvironmental, social and governance \nissues (EESG).\nBusiness performance\n \nWe have made a commitment to our shareholders, \ninvestors and society, to return the Company to it’s \nhistoric performance levels. In 2022, based upon a \ndetailed and careful analysis of our business, we defined \nan efficiency plan, which, once having been implemented \nin the third quarter , had raised R$ 210 million by the close \nof the year .\nAs part of this plan, which began as part of BRF’s new \nshareholding and governance structure, we have \nadopted the foundations of simplicity, agility and \nefficiency. We reviewed our global footprint, adjusted our \nproduct portfolio, optimized our Capex, and engaged \nin maximizing the use of our assets, controlling our \nleverage, and improving our supply management.\nWe have made value captures of around R$ 130 million \nwith the improvement of operational indicators, including \nmortality rates, food conversion and productivity. We have \nalso reduced costs caused by inactivity of around R$ 50 \nmillion and reviewed our logistics efficiency, as well as our \ntransport, distribution and energy contracts. We improved \nthe level of our logistics service by 8 percentage points \n(comparing Feb. 2023 x 2022).\nWe worked hard on the alternative grains consumption \nstrategy (DDG, sorghum and oils), managing to avoid \ncosts of around R$ 100 million over the year .\nWe made advances in our share of practically every \ncategory in Brazil. In the international market, we consol-\nidated our leadership in Halal and received more than 30 \nplant approvals for strategic markets, especially for Asia.\n  \nR$ 210 million\ncaptured through the efficiency program\n77\nValue Generation5\nOur way of \ndoing business\nOur strategy\nCulture and \nEngagement\nIndicators  \nand annex\n3\n4\n6\n2\nPresentation1\n2022 Integrated  \nReport\nIndicators and performance \n \nIn 2022, the net revenue reached R$ 53.8 billion, an \nincrease of 11.3% in relation to the previous year . We \nsaw a 2.8% increase in volumes, with an average price \n8.2% higher in relation to R$/kg. The price strategy \nand the greater volumes partially offset the general \nincrease in costs, from grains to raw-materials, \nand the fluctuations in price of the exportation of \nproducts such as chicken meat.\nThe Adjusted EBITDA for the period was R$ 3.9 billion, \n29.9% below that of the previous year , with earnings \nbeing strongly impacted during the period (both \ngross and net), further reflecting the Company’s \nperformance and operational adjustments. In 2022, \nthe net revenue of the ongoing operations experi-\nenced a loss of R$ 3.1 billion, and in the discontinued \noperations of R$ 51 million.\nThis occurred due to the termination of certain \ndisputes related to losses incurred by entities sold in \nEurope and Thailand in 2018 and 2019, as well as tax \ncontingencies relating to periods prior to the sales.\nOur debt profile has remained long-term and \nbalanced between currencies and diversification, with \nan average term of 8 years. We remain committed \nto increasing the generation of cash flow to reduce \nindebtedness and we have announced an asset \ndemobilization plan totaling around R$ 4 billion;\nSome of the highlights of our indicators are listed \non the following page. In the second table, we \nalso present the consolidated results from the \nmanagement perspective - that is, eliminating the \naccounting effects of the hyperinflation experienced \nin Turkey (as detailed in explanatory note 3.5 in BRF’s \nFinancial Statements, accessible here); the negative \nimpact of the debt referred to as ‘hedge accounting’ \nin the sum of R$ 445 million in the net revenues of the \ninternational markets in the second quarter; and the \nimpact of the Leniency Agreement, which totaled R$ \n583.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 (explan-\natory note
