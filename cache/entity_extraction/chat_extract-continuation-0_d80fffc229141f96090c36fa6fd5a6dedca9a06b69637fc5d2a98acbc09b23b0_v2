During 2022, additional financing of £1.3 billion was provided for \nsustainable transport solutions, primarily through Lombard. Further opportunities are being assessed, aligned \nwith government policy development, to finance green buses and coaches.\n • Internal policies: Policy restrictions are in place to restrict lending to older and highest carbon emitting cars \nand buses. Further work is being carried out to assess linking vehicle emissions thresholds to lending decisions.\n • Sector transaction acceptance standards (TAS): includes qualitative considerations to assess climate-related \nrisks and potential financial impacts, with a view to support environmentally and socially responsible customers \nand identifying further opportunities to support customer transition.\n • Aviation: NatWest Group exposures within the aviation sector primarily relate to secured asset financing \nagainst new-generation aircraft supporting commercial airlines to reduce their CO2 per seat mile. We will \ncontinue to finance the most carbon efficient customers and assets based on criteria set within our TAS.\nKey external dependencies to support transition:\nTechnology and infrastructure development:\n • Increase in electric vehicles will require adequate electric charging infrastructure. Per the Electric \nVehicle Smart Charging Action Plan for affordable, sustainable power for electric vehicles published by the \nDepartment for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy in January 2023, households without off-street \nparking e.g. in flats or rental properties have limited options for accessing smart charging. In addition, \nconsumers are concerned about whether the vehicle will be ready when they need it.\n • New aircraft have lower emissions than older aircraft. However, due to supply chain issues, there is a \ndelay in the manufacture of new aircraft. Potential aviation emissions reduction is reliant on technology \ninnovation delivering more efficient fleets. Sustainable Aviation Fuel technology is in nascent stages of \ndevelopment.\n • Behaviour changes: customers switching to lower emitting modes of transport will contribute to emissions \nreductions. This includes walking, cycling or public transport instead of driving. The up-take of electric \nvehicles instead of petrol and diesel, is evidence of consumer demand for more sustainable transport.\n36NatWest Group plc | 2022 Climate-related Disclosures Report\nGovernance Strategy and Climate transition plan Risk Management and Scenario Analysis Metrics and TargetsIntroduction\nClimate transition plan: Mobility system continued\nNatWest Group and our customers have a dependency on timely and appropriate government policies to support transition. Noted below are policies that are \nexpected to support decarbonisation of the mobility system. \nAs per the UK CCC 2022 Progress Report, overall policies targeted at land transport have “some risk” but are the \nmost advanced in comparison to aviation and shipping in achieving the Government’s Net Zero Strategy. For land \ntransport, the publication of the Transport Decarbonisation Plan (TDP) in 2021, along with the Charging \nInfrastructure Strategy, and consultation on the details of the Zero Emissions Vehicle mandate, represented a \npositive step for the sector, setting out the Government’s vision for how the sector’s emissions can be abated. \nPolicies that reduce reliance on fossil fuels are considered most significant for the aviation and shipping sectors \nHowever, policies aimed at decarbonising aviation and shipping are at “significant risk” of failing to deliver
