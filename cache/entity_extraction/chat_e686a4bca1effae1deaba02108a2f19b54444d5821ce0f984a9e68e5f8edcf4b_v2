Based \non this, the global material mass balance is calculated for \nall materials consumed during the production and CO2e \nemissions are calculated using GaBi (2022) emission factors \nper material group for raw materials used in production \nand manufacturing processes. The actual steel mass for all \nproduced and shipped turbines is used to calculate global \nCO2e emissions for the raw material production of steel and for \nfoundation materials. The CO2e emissions from concrete and \nsteel used in foundations is based on the same LCA reports as \nthe remaining material groups.\nConstruction: The CO2e emissions emitted during the \nconstruction of a wind farm is estimated based on the quantity \nof diesel-fuel consumed per wind turbine produced and \nshipped in markets in which Vestas is responsible for installing \nthe wind turbine. LCA studies for the diesel combustion per \nturbine installation and respective BEIS emission factors \n(2022) are applied. \nService: CO2e emissions from service operations are estimated \nusing the quantity of spare parts that are replaced and \nrepaired in the reporting year, as well as expected repair and \nreplacement levels.
