Amounts taken to other comprehensive \nincome are reclassified from equity to the income statement when the foreign operations are \nsold or liquidated. \nFinancial liabilities \nBorrowings are measured at amortised cost. Those borrowings designated as being in fair \nvalue hedge relationships are remeasured for the fair value changes in respect of the hedged \nrisk with these changes recognised in the income statement. All other financial liabilities, \nincluding short-term payables, are measured at amortised cost. \nPrecious metal sale and repurchase agreements \nThe group and parent company undertake linked contracts to sell or buy precious metal and \ncommit to repurchase or sell the metal in the future. An asset representing the metal which \nthe group and parent company have committed to sell or a liability representing the \nobligation to repurchase the metal are recognised in trade and other receivables or trade and \nother payables, respectively. \nNotes on the Accounts continued for the year ended 31st March 2023 \n155 \n1 Accounting policies continued \nTaxation \nCurrent and deferred tax are recognised in the income statement, except when they relate to \nitems recognised directly in equity, in which case the related tax is also recognised in equity. \nCurrent tax is the amount of income tax expected to be paid in respect of taxable profits using \nthe tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. \nDeferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising \nbetween the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the balance sheet. \nIt is provided using the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset or \nliability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the \nbalance sheet date. \nDeferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits \nwill be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. No deferred tax asset \nor liability is recognised in respect of temporary differences associated with investments in \nsubsidiaries and branches where the group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the \ntemporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the \nforeseeable future. \nProvisions and contingencies \nProvisions are recognised when the group has a present obligation as a result of a past event \nand a reliable estimate can be made of a probable adverse outcome, for example warranties, \nenvironmental claims and restructuring. Otherwise, material contingent liabilities are \ndisclosed unless the probability of the transfer of economic benefits is remote. Contingent \nassets are only disclosed if an inflow of economic benefits is virtually certain. \nShare-based payments and treasury shares \nThe fair value of shares awarded to employees under the performance share plan, restricted \nshare plan, long term incentive plan and deferred bonus plan is calculated by adjusting the \nshare price on the date of allocation for the present value of the expected dividends that will \nnot be received. The resulting cost is charged to the income statement over the relevant \nperformance periods, adjusted to reflect actual and expected levels of vesting where \nappropriate. \nThe group and parent company provide finance to the employee share ownership trust \n(ESOT) to purchase company shares in the open market. Costs of running the ESOT are \ncharged to the income statement. The cost of shares held by the ESOT is deducted in arriving \nat equity until they vest unconditionally with employees. \nPost-employment benefits \nThe costs of defined contribution plans are charged to the income statement as they fall due. \nFor defined benefit plans, the group and parent company recognise the net assets or liabilities \nof the plans in their balance sheets. Assets are measured at their fair value at the balance \nsheet date. Liabilities are measured at present value using the projected unit credit method \nand a discount rate reflecting yields on high quality corporate bonds. The changes in plan \nassets and liabilities, based on actuarial advice, are recognised as follows: \n• The current service cost is deducted in arriving at operating profit. \n• The net interest cost, based on the discount rate at the beginning of the year, contributions \npaid in and the present value of the net defined benefit liabilities during the year, is \nincluded in finance costs. \n• Past service costs and curtailment gains and losses are recognised in operating profit at the \nearlier of when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs and when any related \nrestructuring costs or termination benefits are recognised. \n• Gains or losses arising from settlements are included in operating profit when the \nsettlement occurs. \n• Remeasurements, representing returns on plan assets, excluding amounts included in \ninterest, and actuarial gains and losses arising from changes in financial and demographic \nassumptions, are recognised in other comprehensive income. \nAssets held for sale and discontinued operations \nNon-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale, if available for sale in its \npresent condition and a sale is considered highly probable within 12 months. They are \nmeasured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Assets and \nliabilities classified as held for sale are presented separately on the Balance Sheet. The assets \nare not depreciated or amortised while they are classified as held for sale.  \nAn impairment loss is recognised in the Income Statement for any initial or subsequent write-\ndown of the asset or disposal group to fair value less costs to sell. A gain is recognised for any \nsubsequent increases in fair value less costs to sell of an asset or disposal group, but not in \nexcess of any cumulative\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NET INVESTMENT HEDGES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Financial strategy involving hedging instruments to manage foreign investment risk, recognized in comprehensive income and income statement based on effectiveness)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FINANCIAL LIABILITIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Liabilities measured at amortised cost, including borrowings and short-term payables, with some designated as fair value hedges and remeasured accordingly)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRECIOUS METAL SALE AND REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Contracts to sell or buy precious metals with commitments to repurchase or resell in the future, recognized as assets or liabilities in trade receivables or payables)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TAXATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Accounting for current and deferred taxes, recognizing tax assets and liabilities based on enacted or substantively enacted tax rates, and their relation to items recognized in equity or income)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROVISIONS AND CONTINGENCIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Recognition of provisions for present obligations and disclosure of material contingent liabilities and assets, based on probable outcomes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS AND TREASURY SHARES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Accounting for employee share plans, including fair value calculations, costs charged to income, and treatment of shares held in the ESOT)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Recognition and measurement of defined contribution and benefit plans, including actuarial valuations, net assets or liabilities, and related costs in income and other comprehensive income)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASSETS HELD FOR SALE AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Classification, measurement, and presentation of non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale, including impairment and revaluation adjustments)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ACCOUNTING POLICIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Guidelines and methods for recognizing, measuring, and presenting various financial statement items, including assets, liabilities, income, and expenses)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NET INVESTMENT HEDGES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hedging instruments are used to manage foreign investment risk, recognized in income or comprehensive income based on effectiveness<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FINANCIAL LIABILITIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Liabilities are measured at amortised cost, with some designated as fair value hedges and remeasured accordingly<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PRECIOUS METAL SALE AND REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Contracts to sell or buy precious metals involve commitments recognized as assets or liabilities<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TAXATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tax accounting relates to recognition of current and deferred taxes, affecting income and equity<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROVISIONS AND CONTINGENCIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Provisions are recognized for present obligations, and contingent liabilities/assets are disclosed based on probability<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS AND TREASURY SHARES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Accounting for employee share plans and treasury shares impacts equity and expenses<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Recognition and measurement of pension plans influence financial position and expenses<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ASSETS HELD FOR SALE AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Classification and measurement of assets/liabilities held for sale affect financial statements<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
