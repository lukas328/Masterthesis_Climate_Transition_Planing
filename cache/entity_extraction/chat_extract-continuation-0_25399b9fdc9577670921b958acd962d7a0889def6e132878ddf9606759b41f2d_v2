PCAF \nwas founded in 2015 and in March 2023 it had already \nbeen joined by over 370 financial institutions around the \nworld. It is recommended by TCFD as a methodology to \nmeasure financed emissions in financial institutions.\n • CDP_ we also disclose climate-related information to \nCDP , the main global climate finance index, with issues \naligned to TCFD.  \n • Paris Agreement_ as signatories to PRB and NZBA, we \naim to align our strategy with the Paris Climate Agreement \nsigned in 2015, which has the goal of limiting the rise in \nglobal average temperature to 2º C, with efforts to keep \nit below 1.5ºC. \n • Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures \n(TCFD) _ since 2017, we have supported and act on to \ncomply with the TCFD, a task force created by the G20-\nlinked Financial Stability Board (FSB), which encourages \norganizations to get to know and disclose information \nabout the impact of climate change on their business. \nThe goal is to allow investors to make well-informed \ndecisions and turn climate information disclosure into a \nmarket practice.  \n • Principles for Responsible Banking (PRB)_ since 2019 \nwe have been signatories to PRB, which are linked to the \nUnited Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative \n(UNEP-FI) and aim to align the global financial system \nto initiatives that promote positive impact on society \nand on Earth. Climate change is a topic that is present in \nPRB, which provide for financial institutions to align their \nstrategies with global climate commitments, notably the \nParis Agreement, among other practices.\n • Unep-FI_ we are a member of the TCFD Working Group, \nteamed up with nearly 40 financial institutions from \ndifferent countries, and are involved in the development \nof the Transition Check Tool, a tool for analysis of \ntransition scenarios. \n • Brazilian Federation of Banks (FEBRABAN) _ in \n2022 we joined the Climate Squad, a group focused \non addressing the alignment of global methodologies \nwith the Brazilian reality. We developed and \nimplemented tools to identify material climate risks \nand manage climate finance, addressing physical and \ntransition risks associated with the Brazilian scenario, \nand changes in the loan portfolio sensitivity to \nclimate change. \n8 \nItaú Unibanco Holding S.A.climate report 2022\nNet Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA)\nAchieving Net Zero means reducing net emissions of CO₂ equivalent (CO₂e)5 to zero. The \nreduction of emissions requires measures such as the adoption of new, more efficient \ntechnologies, technologies for carbon capture and renewable energy sources, among other \npossibilities. \nEmissions can be caused by direct operation (what we call scope 1), energy consumption \n(scope 2), and by sources that, although not controlled by the company, are included in its \nactivity broadly, such as suppliers and clients (scope 3). \nWhen it comes to banks, major emissions are those related to the loan portfolio, that \nis, financed issues (scope 3). This means that, to achieve Net Zero, we rely on the \ndecarbonization of our clients and the real economy. To face up to this challenge, \nin October 2021 we joined NZBA, a UNEP-FI-linked initiative that gathered 126 financial \ninstitutions from 41 countries in March 2023, accounting for 41% of global banking assets. \nNZBA is a member of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), founded with \nthe goal to connect financial institutions to United Nations’ Race to Zero, a campaign that \nmobilizes leaders, businesses, cities and investors to achieve Net Zero by 2050.\nThe NZBA recommends that target setting be in line with the latest science-based scenarios \nto lead to net zero on a 1.5°C transition pathway, such as the scenarios constructed by \nthe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the Net Zero Scenario by the \nInternational Energy Agency (IEA). Taking into consideration the size of the challenge and \nbased on climate scenarios, the NZBA has defined nine sectors as priority:\nAgriculture\nAluminum\nCement\nCoal\nReal Estate\nSteel\nOil & Gas\nPower Generation\nTransport\nCommitments made \nBy joining NZBA we made the following commitments:\nAchieve net zero by 2050 for scopes 1, 2 and 3.\nDisclose targets for the nine sectors prioritized by NZBA\nwithin 36 months after joining.\nCarry out the first disclosure of targets, focusing on significant\nsectors and clients, within 18 months after joining NZBA,\nconsidering intermediate targets for 2030.\nDisclose, one year after the sector targets, an action plan for\ntheir achievement; \nReview targets and the transition plan every five years after\njoining.\nAnnually disclose the financed emissions and the progress\nof our climate actions.\nAchieving net zero in 2050 relies on the availability of data, tools and methodologies \nappropriate for monitoring actions, the evolution of technologies that contribute to the \ndecarbonization of sectors and their adoption by our clients and the public authorities. \nTechnology solutions are not yet widely available or not scalable for some economic \nsectors. These sectors require support in their transition and to be monitored by \nmarket agents.\n5 Carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) corresponds to all different greenhouse gases evaluated based on\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PARTNERSHIP FOR CARBON ACCOUNTING FINANCIALS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>PCAF is a global partnership of financial institutions founded in 2015, focused on developing methodologies to measure financed and invested carbon emissions.
