As an example, supply chain capabilities within the \nconstruction sector can influence the speed of retrofitting within the \ncommercial real estate sector and residential mortgages, and hence \ntheir decarbonisation.\nTo support this and continue the evolution of our initial transition plan in \n2023, we plan to adopt a systems thinking approach to identify the key \npoints of leverage to enable systems-wide transformation and \ndecarbonisation. A systems thinking approach considers how carbon \nflows between sectors in the economy, and factors that determine the \nmagnitude of those carbon flows. These factors can include:\n • Government policy\n • Carbon intensity of materials, technologies and infrastructure\n • Configurations of existing value chains\n • Consumer preferences and behaviours\nUnderstanding these factors for each system will support the \nidentification of opportunities to impact the size and direction of carbon \nflows in sectors within a system. This work has informed our focus on \ngrowth areas to amplify our 2023 strategy, such as supporting our \ncustomers’ sustainability transitions.\nConsiderations regarding systems thinking:\n • Impact of energy systems decarbonisation: We recognise that the \ndecarbonisation of certain sectors can have a large impact on \ndecarbonisation within other sectors, the most prominent being \nenergy. The decarbonisation of energy supply and energy demand \n(particularly in mobility and buildings) will play a prominent role in \ndecarbonisation across other sectors. In addition, the manufacturing \nsector, through the manufacture of products and components that will \nsupport transition to electrification, will also aid decarbonisation in \nother sectors.\n • Transition may not be linear: As additional funds are invested in \nsupporting transition across sectors and systems, there may be \nincreased emissions in the short-term before average emissions \nintensities reduce causing a reduction in absolute emissions in the \nmedium to long-term.\n • Opportunities within one sector may be dependent on another \nsector within a system: Within the property system, there is a \ndependency on greener building materials, efficient building practices \nand adequate supply chain to support the decarbonisation \nof mortgages and commercial real estate.\nManufacturers \nand distributors\nProperty \ndevelopers\nHousing \nassociation and \nlocal authorities\nSME \ncontractors\nCommercial \nproperty \nowners\nPrivate home \nowners\nUpstream value chain Downstream value chain\nSystem \nThinking\nMobility\n£14.5 billion\nEnergy\n£5.8 billion\nFinancial\nFinancial Institutions\n£20.9 billion(1)\nAssets under Management\n£28.3 billion\nProperty\n£234.0 billion\nFood\n£4.8 billion\nThe diagram below represents sectors and portfolios included within the initial iteration of our Climate transition plan \naggregated and presented as systems.

Transition plan work during 2022 has primarily focused on the residential \nmortgages portfolio, and the commercial real estate, housing associations and construction sectors. NatWest Group lending exposure to these sectors was £234.0 billion at 31 December 2022  \n(£225.2 billion at 31 December 2021).\nSystem Context: As per the UK CCC 2022 Progress Report, around 20% of the UK’s emissions come from \nbuildings, making them the second largest source of emissions in the UK after surface transport, with about 77% of \nUK building emissions in 2021 relating to residential properties, followed by commercial real estate (about 13%) and \npublic sector buildings (about 10%).\nAs one of the largest lenders in the UK, we have a key role to play in supporting consumers and businesses in \ntransitioning to more energy efficient homes and buildings that are warmer, cheaper to heat, and generate lower \nemissions. Decarbonising properties will require retrofitting existing buildings to increase their energy efficiency, \nconstructing new energy efficient buildings and decarbonisation of electricity and heating supply. There is therefore \na dependency on other sectors e.g. building materials construction, manufacture of low carbon appliances and \ntechnologies as well as the energy system, for decarbonisation of the property system. At 31 December 2021, \nestimated absolute financed emissions for these sectors (excluding housing associations) are 4.0 MtCO2e with \nestimated emissions intensities of 37.8kgCO2e/m2  for mortgages and 56.6kgCO2e/m2 for CRE. Scope 2 emissions \nrelated to purchased electricity comprise c.25%% of estimated absolute emissions. As a result, decarbonisation in \nthese sectors has a dependency on decarbonisation of the electricity grid.\nKey products and services to support decarbonisation:\nResidential mortgages:\nOur strategy within this sector comprises four pillars that we will continue to develop to support customer \ntransition:\n • Customer engagement: Providing educational information, building credibility and understanding with \ncustomers to support them in making their homes more sustainable.\n • Product choices: Rewarding and incentivising customers to purchase and refinance the most energy efficient \nhomes and upgrade the energy efficiency of their current homes.\n • Sector engagement: Engaging with wider stakeholders within the sector to help influence change.\n • Manage risk and data: Maintaining and developing the appropriate controls to manage the climate-related \nrisk of our portfolio.\nAligned with this, we have:\n • Launched a suite of\n######################\nOutput:",
