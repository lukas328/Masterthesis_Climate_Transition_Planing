Railpen incorporates assessment of climate risk and net-zero alignment \ninto investment decisions using CRIANZA (Climate Risk And Net Zero Alignment), a proprietary framework and \ndeveloped in-house. CRIANZA, a bottom-up portfolio assessment tool, is used to assess individual companies on \ntheir climate risk and net-zero alignment. \nCRIANZA is currently used to assess the key emitters contributing to 70% of Railpen’s financed emissions in material \nsectors in listed equities ,129 but it has been designed to be applied across asset classes and to analyze sponsoring \nemployers in the future. 130 It incorporates sector-specific features and can be used for risk management, regulatory \nreporting, and to identify gaps in a company’s practice, informing discussions and engagement. \nFor each company, CRIANZA produces a risk score (ranging from 1 [low] to 5 [high] risk) and a net-zero alignment \nstatus (Not Aligned, Committed, Aligning, or Fully Aligned). The alignment scores are determined using a \nmilestone-based approach also outlined in the IIGCC Net Zero Stewardship Toolkit 131 to assess and score a \ncompany’s alignment with a net-zero pathway. The objective of the portfolio alignment assessment is “to enable a \nfeedback loop between company analysis and company engagement.” 132\nIMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY\nCONTENTS  |  FINANCIAL INSTITUTION NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLANS — FUNDAMENTALS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND GUIDANCE\n51\n \nThe assessment criteria are shown in the figure below. 133 They feature many of the net-zero transition plan \ncomponents and considerations set out by GFANZ in this document.\nFigure 15. CRIANZA’s Net Zero Alignment Assessment Criteria\nAs part of the 2021 net-zero plan, Railpen Trustees have set a target that, by 2040, 100% of AUM in material \nsectors should be “aligning” or “fully aligned.” In 2021, based on the analysis of 70% of financed emissions, \nwhich is 10% of overall AUM, 1% of AUM in material sectors fell into these categories. Progressing this further, the \nCRIANZA assessment can be carried out on all holdings in material sectors and may result in the percentage in \n“aligning” or “fully aligned” companies to potentially be higher. The CRIANZA assessment criteria will influence \nfuture decision-making and engagement.  \nRailpen also uses the CRIANZA framework to assess companies for purposes of its Net Zero Engagement Plan \n(NZEP).134 The NZEP uses a four-step approach of prioritization, analysis, engagement and voting, and reporting  \nof decarbonization impact on portfolio companies.\n133 See Figure 5.4.4.2.1 in Railways Pension Scheme.

I.e. the insights from \nthe analysis feeds into climate stewardship, which \nultimately should improve company alignment over \ntime. The Trustee has adopted a target to increase the \nproportion of portfolio companies rated as “aligning” \nand “fully aligned” (see section 6). The CRIANZA \nframework and tool uses sector and asset class specific \nanalysis in its scoring thereby providing a consistent \ndata and metrics means that enable the Trustee to \nmeasure and track progress against this target.\n5.4.4.3 Climate Risk Integration in Private \nMarkets and Property\nPrivate markets represented c11% of Scheme assets at \nDecember 2021. Private markets investors are beset by \na lower level of climate-related information compared \nto public markets. In addition, private markets have \nbeen a little slower to develop net zero methodologies. \nRailpen has sought to work with industry peers to \ndevelop a private markets methodology for net zero \nand to that end Railpen has been an active member \nof the Paris Aligned Investing Initiative’s Private Equity \nWorking Group, whose draft methodology was \npublished in February 2022. \nOur investments in real assets consist mainly of \nproperty and infrastructure assets located in the UK. \nThe portfolio is therefore impacted by trends in UK \nclimate data. The UK climate data indicate that there \nhas been, and will continue to be, a shift to a warmer \nclimate. The most recent assessment from the UK \nGovernment and the Climate Change Committee \n(CCC) indicates strong evidence that even under low \nwarming scenarios, the UK will be subject to a range of \nsignificant and costly impacts unless significant further \npolicy action is taken in the near-term. \nReal assets can be particularly vulnerable to physical \nclimate risks. These risks can be event-driven and \nacute, like heatwaves, bushfires or floods, or longer-\nterm shifts such as rising sea levels or an increase in \nmajor weather events. Financial implications include \ndirect damage to assets, business disruption and \nindirect impacts from supply chain disruption. Real \nassets can also be vulnerable to transition climate \nrisks, for example if increasingly stringent climate \npolicy measures affect an asset’s ability to generate \nincome, or\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
