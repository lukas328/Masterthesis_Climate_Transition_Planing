The \nportfolio will have an overarching Sustainable \nDevelopment Goal (‘SDG’) alignment which will \nbe skewed towards companies that have a high \npositive SDG score on environmental SDGs 1. \nWe will look to increase our allocation of \npolicyholder assets to climate solution funds \nover the course of 2023 and beyond. \nInvestments in venture capital funds\nWe have a dedicated venture capital fund with \nan initial allocation in excess of £100 million.  \nThis is the first allocation to venture capital in our \npolicyholder funds, and the first allocation to \npatient capital in our unit linked funds.

Hence, \nwe consider it particularly important to \nprovide greater clarity on our definition of \nsustainable investments and/or transitional \nand productive finance assets. We have \nrecently published our Sustainable Finance \nClassification Framework for Private Markets \nand will continue to review and evolve our \nframework as standards mature.\n1  The SDGs are a collection of 17 non-legally binding interlinked global goals set forth by the UN for countries and governments.
