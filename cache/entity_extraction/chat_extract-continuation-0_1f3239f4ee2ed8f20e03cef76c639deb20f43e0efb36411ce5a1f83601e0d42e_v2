for the long-term success and \nsustainability of Bupa for the benefit of its customers \nand wider stakeholders, now and in the future. It works \nto achieve this by providing clear leadership in setting \nstrategy and risk appetite and by overseeing \nmanagement’s implementation of strategy within \na prudent and effective governance structure and \nensuring that Bupa’s culture is aligned with our \npurpose, values and strategy. \nWe choose to apply the UK Corporate Governance \nCode 2018 (the Code) as we aim, where appropriate, \nto operate to the same governance standards as are \nrequired of UK listed companies. The table on pages \n65-66 signposts the location of descriptions of how we \nhave applied the principles of the Code during the year. \nBupa’s system of governance is designed to enable \nthe Board to lead within a governance framework of \nprudent and effective controls which enables risks to \nbe assessed and managed using a ‘three lines’ model. \nThe Board delegates certain activities to its Committees \nto ensure that there is sufficient time to discuss and \nprovide challenge in these areas, and to allow the \nBoard to focus on key strategic decisions. As a private \ncompany limited by guarantee, Bupa does not have \nshareholders and the governance and many of the \noversight activities performed by shareholders are \ninstead performed by the AMs. \nThere is a schedule of matters reserved to the Board \nfor decision which include: setting Bupa’s strategy and \nensuring that Bupa’s culture is aligned with its purpose, \nvalues and strategy; changes to the Group’s capital \nstructure; approval of major transactions and significant \ncapital expenditure; and overseeing the Group’s internal \ncontrol and risk management processes to ensure that \nthey remain appropriate and are operating effectively. \nThe schedule is reviewed annually and is available here \non bupa.com. All other matters are delegated to the \nGroup CEO, who cascades authority to the business \nand Group Functions through a delegated \nauthority framework. \nThe Chairman and the Group CEO \nThe roles of the Chairman and the Group CEO are \nseparate with distinct accountabilities. \nThe Chairman is responsible for leading the Board and \nfocusing it on strategic matters, overseeing the Group’s \nbusiness and setting high governance standards. He \nplays a pivotal role in fostering the effectiveness of the \nBoard and individual Directors, both inside and outside \nthe boardroom. The Chairman is also responsible for \nensuring that there is effective communication with the \nAMs, acting as a sounding board for the Group CEO, \nand representing the Group externally. With the support \nof the Group Company Secretary, he ensures that the \nBoard receives accurate, timely and clear information. \nThe Group CEO, Iñaki Ereño, is responsible for the day-\nto-day leadership and management of the business, risk \nappetite and annual and long-term objectives approved \nby the Board. He may make decisions in all matters \naffecting the operations, performance and \nimplementation of our strategy, except for those \nmatters reserved for the Board or specifically delegated \nby the Board to its Committees, executive committees \nor subsidiary company boards. He is supported in this \nby the senior executives that make up the CEC. \nRoger Davis was appointed as Chairman from 1 January \n2019, having been an independent Non-Executive \nDirector since July 2015 and was re-appointed by the \nBoard for a further three-year term as Chairman from 1 \nJanuary 2022. The Board was satisfied that Roger met \nthe independence criteria in the Code at the time of his \nappointment as Chairman. Roger reduced the number \nof his external appointments following his appointment \nas Chairman and the Board considers that his current \nexternal appointments do not hinder him from \nproviding sufficient time to his duties at Bupa. Details \nof his other appointments are set out in his biography \non page 59. \nThe Senior Independent Director \nPaul Evans was appointed as Senior Independent \nDirector (SID) from 1 May 2022, following Clare \nThompson’s retirement from the Board. His role is to \nserve as a conduit for Directors and AMs who may have \nconcerns that have not been resolved through other \nchannels, to act as a sounding board for the Chairman \nand Group CEO on Board and AM matters, and to lead \nthe annual review of the Chairman’s performance. \nNon-Executive Directors \nOur NEDs provide an independent view on the running \nof our business, governance and boardroom best \npractice. They oversee, constructively challenge and \nhold to account, management in their implementation \nof strategy within the Group’s system of governance \nand the risk appetite set by the Board. The Board \nconsiders each of the current NEDs to meet the \nindependence criteria in the Code. \nThe Board comprises a majority of independent NEDs, \nand all Directors offer themselves\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BUPA<|><organization<|>Bupa is a private healthcare company that provides health insurance, medical services, and related healthcare products.
