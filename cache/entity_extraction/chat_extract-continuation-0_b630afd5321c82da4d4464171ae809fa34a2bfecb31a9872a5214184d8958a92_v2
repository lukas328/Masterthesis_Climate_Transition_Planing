There are three main engagement approaches financial institutions can use  \nto help implement net-zero ambitions, strategies, and targets: \n• Engage with clients and portfolio companies.\n• Engage with financial sector peers and industry associations.\n• Engage with governments and the public sector.\nRecommendation\nProactively and constructively provide \nfeedback and support to clients and portfolio \ncompanies to encourage net zero-aligned \ntransition strategies, plans, and progress with \nan escalation framework with consequences \nwhen engagement is  ineffective.\n \nOverview and relevance: Financial institutions can \nplay a significant role in supporting and advising \nclients and portfolio companies on their approach \nthe transition to net zero. Different types of \ninstitutions have different capabilities and client \nmixes, and the nature of engagement, therefore, \nvaries broadly. \nGuidance: Financial institutions should develop an \nengagement strategy that supports their overall \nnet-zero strategy consistent with their commitment. \nThe strategy should be tailored to the institution’s \nbusiness model, as well as the needs and context \nof specific clients or portfolio companies and the \nrelationship between the financial institution and \nthe company. Financial institutions should review \nexisting client and portfolio company engagement \nto ensure that efforts are consistent with the nature \nof their net-zero objectives or transition strategy, \nand work to bring existing efforts in line with their \nnet-zero engagement strategy.\nThe engagement strategy should include the \nfollowing characteristics:\n• Clear objectives: the desired behaviors, \nrequests, or results from clients or portfolio \ncompanies (including implementing a net-zero \ntransition plan).\n• Timing of engagement:  length of engagement, \ndeadlines, and milestones to indicate progress.\n• Coverage: extent of engagement over client \nand company portfolios (e.g., as a percentage \nof the portfolio) and how to prioritize if \n100% engagement has not been reached \n(e.g., by greatest potential influence or \nhighest emissions).\n• Method of engagement:  including meetings, \nletters, conferences, educational material, and  \nother forms of engagement selected based \non engagement target and relationship (e.g., \nequity ownership, debt holder, client) and other \nconsiderations including levers available to the \nfinancial institution (e.g., side letters, insurance \ncontracts) or length of time of the relationship \nor influence.\n1) COMPONENT: CLIENTS AND PORTFOLIO COMPANIES \nCONTENTS  |  FINANCIAL INSTITUTION NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLANS — FUNDAMENTALS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND GUIDANCE\n62\nEngagement in support of net-zero objectives \nrequires a baseline understanding of the client’s \nor portfolio company’s business with respect to \nclimate impacts. Sectoral pathways can be used as \na benchmark for comparison and assessment of the \nbusiness or the project where finance is requested. \nDepending on the goals of a particular engagement \neffort, engagement may require a commitment of \nseveral years and a collaborative approach, along \nwith a clear escalation process.\nAn escalation process with consistent and \ntransparent criteria that are communicated to the \nclient and portfolio companies should also be a \ncritical part of an engagement strategy. This may \ninclude sharing the financial institution’s net-zero \ntransition plan and policies and conditions with \nclients and portfolio companies. When clients or \nportfolio companies show little or no response \nto the engagement, a financial institution should \nconsider using the business levers available to \nit according to its business relationship. These \nlevers will differ and include stewardship actions \nsuch as proxy voting, shareholder resolutions, \nand voting to remove directors who have failed in \ntheir accountability; financing levers such as more \nonerous/costly lending conditions and refusal to \nengage in new business; and, as a last resort,  \ncessation of the relationship either as a service or \nproduct provider, or opting to divest.187 \nFinancial institutions should consider appropriate \ncollaboration to promote a clear and consistent \nengagement objective and streamline the \ninformation request to the real-economy \ncompanies. Working together, as appropriate,  \n187 See guidance from CA100+ , CERES , Investor Agenda , UN PRI, and CDP (science-based targets campaign and non-\ndisclosure campaign).\n188 For example, see CA100+  and the PRI Collaboration  Platform .\n189 For example, banks can refer to: NZBA. NZBA Transition Finance Guide , October 2022. and University of Cambridge Institute \nfor Sustainability Leadership and Banking Environment Initiative. Let’s Discuss Climate: The essential guide to bank-client \nengagement , May 2021.\ncan magnify an individual institution’s effort \nto encourage clients and portfolio companies \nto progress work on net-zero commitments. \nFor example, financial institutions can consider \njoining industry groups that engage with clients \nand portfolio companies on behalf of a group of \nfinancial institutions. 188 \nThe following are examples of client/company-\nspecific engagement activities and subjects. \nMany of these can be designed to be specific \ntwo-way communication with clients and \nportfolio companies:\n• Share net-zero objectives and priorities with \nclients and companies, including specific \ntimelines and consequences, as articulated in \nthe financial institution’s net-zero transition plan \nand receive feedback on such. Such discussions \nmay include clarifying or explaining to clients/\ncompanies the policies and conditions the \ninstitution is implementing or any other criteria \nthat may impact access to or cost of capital. \nThe discussions may also include topics about \nthe social impacts of the client/portfolio \ncompany’s activities\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role":
