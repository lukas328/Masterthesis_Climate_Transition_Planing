Of this amount, \n£113 million (2022: £113 million) is held within the parent company. \nThe group has significant goodwill arising from the acquisition of businesses and the carrying value \nis dependent on the financial performance of the cash generating unit (CGU) to which it relates. \nThe two largest CGUs are Catalyst Technologies and Clean Air Heavy Duty Catalysts which account \nfor £268m (2022: £266m) and £87m (2022: £83m) respectively of goodwill at 31 March 2023. \nThe goodwill held in the parent company relates to the Catalyst Technologies CGU.\nThe impairment assessments prepared by management reflect its best estimates of future \ncashflows. These estimates contain significant uncertainty and are inherently judgemental in \nnature, where changes in the key assumptions can result in materially different impairment charges \nor available headroom. As set out in note 1 management has considered the impacts of climate \nchange in their models. This is therefore an area of focus in our audit procedures. \nIn the year, an impairment charge of £4 million was recorded against goodwill in relation to \nthe Diagnostic Services CGU as the fair value of the proceeds less costs to dispose was lower than \nthe carrying value. Management’s assessment of the goodwill in the other CGUs concluded that \nno impairment was required. \nManagement included disclosures to explain its key judgements and estimates as part of  \nnotes 1 and 5.\nWe obtained management’s value in use goodwill impairment models and agreed the \nforecast cash flows to board‑approved budgets, assessed how these budgets are compiled, \nconfirmed data accuracy and understood key related judgements and estimates. \nWe assessed management’s historical forecasting accuracy by comparing the prior year \nforecasts with actual results. This informed our independent sensitivity analysis. \nWe performed work over each material CGU being the Catalyst Technologies and Clean Air \nHeavy Duty Catalysts CGUs. The nature and extent of work was commensurate with the level \nof headroom and sensitivity of the CGU to impairment. \nOur testing was focused on the key assumptions in the board‑approved three year forecasts \nand we corroborated the assumptions to supporting evidence which included both internal \nand external sources of evidence. In addition, we assessed the appropriateness and impact \nof the specific growth assumptions applied by management for the period after the year three \nforecast but before a long term growth rate is applied (typically year ten). \nManagement has included certain key assumptions relating to climate change. These include \nrestricting the useful economic life applied in modelling Heavy Duty Catalysts to 2040 \n(2022: 2040), and the application of a negative growth rate from 2033 (2022: 2033). \nWorking with our valuation experts we have considered external market outlooks and \ninformation on emission legislation to corroborate these assumptions. \nWe engaged our valuations experts to assess the long term growth rate and discount rate \nfor each CGU by comparison with third party information, past performance and relevant risk \nfactors. Our procedures also included considering the overall level of risk in the future cash \nflow projections. \nOur procedures included testing the basis for management’s business plans and expectations \nin line with the group’s latest strategy and considering the latest industry outlooks used \nby management. \nWe tested the mathematical integrity of the forecasts and of the value in use model, audited \nthe allocation of central costs to the CGUs and agreed the carrying values in management’s \nimpairment models to underlying accounting records. \nWe assessed management’s sensitivity analysis and performed our own independent \nsensitivity analysis which were more severe than management’s to assess whether a \nreasonable downside change in the key assumptions could give rise to a material impairment. \nWe consider the disclosures with respect of goodwill, including the associated sensitivities \nto be appropriate. \nBased on the procedures performed, we noted no material issues arising from our work.\nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 2023 135\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION\nIndependent auditors’ report to the members of Johnson Matthey Plc continued\nKey audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter\nUncertain tax provisions (group and parent)\nRefer to the Significant issues considered by the Audit Committee and note 1 and 36 to the financial \nstatements. \nThe group operates in a number of international jurisdictions, and as a result there is risk \nof uncertain tax exposures arising around the group, as well as heightened risk around estimates \nin determining the tax effect of cross border transactions including transfer pricing arrangements. \nAs at 31 March 2023 the group had provisions for uncertain tax liabilities of £97 million \n(2022: £103 million).
