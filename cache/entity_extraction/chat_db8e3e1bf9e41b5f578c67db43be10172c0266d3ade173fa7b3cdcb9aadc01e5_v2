They allow for growth, investment, and comparability across sectors  \nMETRICS AND TARGETS\nCONTENTS  |  FINANCIAL INSTITUTION NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLANS — FUNDAMENTALS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND GUIDANCE\n79\nand portfolios. However, they target emissions efficiency improvements less directly, and can also \nbe subject to volatility through changes in the denominator that may be unrelated to climate such as \nchanges in company revenue. \nPhysical intensity metrics address these concerns by scaling emissions relative to a production \nmeasure (e.g., MWh produced), which can then encourage a transformation of the business through \ngreater use of carbon-efficient technologies and processes. However, use of sector-specific \nproduction data does not support comparability between sectors and such data for each sector may \nnot always be available. There is also a debate over whether physical intensity metrics are best suited \nin the fossil fuel sectors where net-zero scenarios suggest a reduction in production is required, which \nmay not be as easily conveyed by intensity metrics. \nBoth types of intensity metrics can result in total emissions increasing even if the carbon intensity \nmeasure used decreases. There is also a risk of volatility across both absolute and intensity metrics in \nhigh-emitting industries because of several factors such as fluctuations in revenue, production volume, \nand market movements. Drivers of the changes in the metrics should be tracked to attribute the \nchange to emissions reduction efforts or other factors. Ultimately getting absolute emissions to zero \nis the end goal, and both absolute and intensity metrics should be considered together to measure \nprogress of different pathways to net zero.\nGuidance by metric categories  \nInstitutions should use multiple metrics to track \nprogress toward their interim and final net-zero \ntargets. GFANZ acknowledges that emphasizing \nportfolio emissions reduction targets, such as \nportfolio footprints, could have unintended \nconsequences of reducing financing support to \nreal-economy emissions reduction efforts as laid \nout in Part B. Therefore, this guidance recommends \ncomplementing client and portfolio emissions  \nmetrics with metrics that focus on real-economy \nemissions reductions. The latter may be related to \nany or all of the four key financing strategies the \nfinancial institution selected as its objectives and \npriorities. Also, metrics to track internal progress \nin executing the net-zero transition plan are key to \nmanaging the implementation of the plan. Figure  \n19 summarizes the three overarching categories of \nmetrics and targets that can be used to monitor \nprogress against net-zero objectives and priorities.\nMETRICS AND TARGETS\nCONTENTS  |  FINANCIAL INSTITUTION NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLANS — FUNDAMENTALS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND GUIDANCE\n80\nFigure 19.

Portfolio emissions\nAligning\n Managed \nphaseout\nClimate \nsolutions\nAligned\nMetrics and targets for each category are meant to measure progress for different aspects of a net-zero commitment. Category 1 \nfocuses on how financing and related services enable emissions reduction in the real economy. Category 2 focuses on the execution  \nof the plan within a financial institution. Category 3 reflects the changes in the real economy broadly in client and company portfolios. \nAs the rollout of the net-zero transition plan progresses, progress may be seen in category 1 and, finally, category 3.\n \nThe three categories introduced in Figure  19, which \nfinancial institutions should consider monitoring \nand setting targets against, are described here with \ndetailed discussions of key considerations.\nSee the “Metrics and targets examples and case \nstudies” section in the Financial Institution Net-\nzero Transition Plans — Supplemental Information \nreport for examples of metrics and targets for all \nthree categories.\n \n1. Metrics and targets for the real-\neconomy transition \nFinancial institutions should use metrics and targets \nto monitor and describe progress in supporting the \nkey financing strategies they selected to prioritize \nin their transition plans. The four key financing \nstrategies are positive actions to decarbonize the \n \nreal economy as introduced in Part B and include \nfinancing and related services to enable and \nsupport 1) climate solutions; 2) companies already \naligned to net zero; 3) the transition of companies \ncommitted to aligning; and 4) the managed \nphaseout of high-emitting physical assets. Because \nthese actions could temporarily increase client \nand portfolio emissions in the short term, using \nonly portfolio emissions footprint metrics may \nnot reflect the extent of transition activities the \nfinancial institution may be supporting. \nTable 8 provides some illustrative examples of \nthe potential key financing strategies may have \non portfolio emissions and why use of only \nbackward-looking portfolio footprint metrics could \nbe misleading.\nMETRICS AND TARGETS\nCONTENTS  |  FINANCIAL INSTITUTION NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLANS — FUNDAMENTALS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND GUIDANCE\n81\nTable 8.
