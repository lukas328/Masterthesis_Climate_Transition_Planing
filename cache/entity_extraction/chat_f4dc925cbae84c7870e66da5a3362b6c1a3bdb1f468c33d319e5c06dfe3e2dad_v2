Some of our \nproduction plants have not had any accidents involving \ntime off work for three years and we want this to be the \ncase for all our other plants. \nA benchmark for the sector in occupational health and \nsafety, the Company’s aim is to achieve this recognition in \na broader sector than simply that of frozen foods, be-\ncoming a benchmark in the food and beverage market \nas a whole. To achieve this, we have involved an external \nconsultancy to support us on this journey towards Zero \nAccidents. \nAt BRF, all accidents are recorded in the internal system \nwithin 24 hours of the accident occurring. Following this, \nan investigative commission is created to collect evidence \nand analyze the causes of what has occurred, presenting \nthis information to leadership committees. Depending \nupon the real and/or potential seriousness of the occur-\nrence, a red alert is issued to the entire Company as a \nmeans of disseminating all that has been learned from \nthe case. \nOf all the accidents that occurred in 2022, 53% were due \nto unsafe behavior and non-compliance with the proto-\ncols on the part of the employees involved - a percentage \nthat drops to 51% in the case of serious accidents. In the \nother 47%, the dominant factor was the conditions of risk \npresent in the operation - the presence of water on the \nfloor , for example.\nDespite a reduction of 8 percentage points in the rate of \nfrequency of accidents, last year saw an increase in the \nseriousness of accidents, both in terms of the number of \nserious accidents themselves and in the number of work-\ning days lost (see the table). In addition to this, four fatal \naccidents unfortunately occurred in 2022. Two of the vic-\ntims were outsourced workers performing maintenance \nwork at the Rio Verde (GO) production unit, when they \nwere affected by an ammonia leakage. The third victim \nwas one of our own employees working in the ingredi-\nents department, who suffered a serious accident at the \nToledo (PR) plant. The fourth victim - also one of our own \nemployees, working at the Concórdia (SC) production unit \n- suffered an accident causing a rupture of the tendon in \nhis knee. This final death occurred following post-surgery \ncomplications, when the employee suffered a pulmonary \nproblem during the recuperation process. \nThe measures taken to eliminate other dangers and \nreduce the risks of accidents are the result of a diagnosis \nof High Potential Risks and the development of a plan \ntogether with the prioritized units. BRF has developed \na pilot application of Computer Vision technology using \nArtificial Intelligence in the prevention of accidents and in-\ncidents relating to intervention in moving machinery. Also \nof special note was the implementation of the Executive \nOperational Committee (EOC), which is focused on poten-\ntial high risks related to more serious accidents.\nSome BRF plants have not had any \naccidents for three years and we are \nworking on a daily basis for this to also be a \nreality for all our other plants\n71\nOur strategy\nCulture and \nEngagement\nValue Generation\nIndicators  \nand annex\n3\n4\n5\n6\nOur way of  \ndoing business\n2\n2022 Integrated  \nReport\nPresentation1\nWork-related injuries1, 2 and 3 GRI 403-9\n \n2020 2021 2022\nEmployees Workers Employees Workers Employees Workers \nNumber of hours worked 185,950,987.88 39,030,832.10 191,808,181.36 39,696,502.44 185,478,539.00 33,216,372.00\nNumber of fatalities as a result of work-related \ninjuries 2 0 0 0 2 2\nRate of fatalities as a result of work-related injury 0.01 0 0 0 0.01 0.06\nNumber of serious work-related injuries (excluding \nfatalities) 234 81 149 41 178 45\nRate of high-consequence work-related injuries \n(excluding fatalities)1.26 2.08 0.78 1.03 0.96 1.35\nNumber of recorded work-related injuries (including \nfatalities) 1,845 227 1,287 135 1,113 118\nRate of recorded work-related injuries (including \nfatalities) 9.92 5.82 6.71 3.4 6.00 3.55\n1 Includes workers who are not employees, but whose work and/or location of work is controlled by the organization\n2 The base for the number of work hours  considered is 1,000,000 hours.\n3 The data compiled is in line with NBR norm 14280 as well as specific corporate regulations, whilst the injury rate observes the methodology of the Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
