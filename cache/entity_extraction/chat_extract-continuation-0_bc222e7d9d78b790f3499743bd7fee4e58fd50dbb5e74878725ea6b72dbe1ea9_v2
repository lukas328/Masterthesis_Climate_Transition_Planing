Where available, we used GHG emissions reduction targets disclosed by \ncustomers through CDP to calculate temperature scores for each customer. Customers who did not have \nexternally disclosed targets through CDP were assigned a default score of 3.2°C.\nTargets set by customers are expected to become more ambitious, aligned with expected regulatory \ndevelopments including disclosure requirements. This will reduce the use of default score of 3.2°C, currently \nallocated to customers, replaced by actual temperature ratings linked to their targets. As a result, NatWest \nGroup portfolio temperature rating is expected to decrease over time, eventually converging to 1.5°C. Further \nanalysis of the SBTi temperature rating methodology is available within the Measuring Portfolio Alignment report.\nOil and gas\nEstimated production intensity (tCO2e/TJ)\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n2019 2021 2025 2030 2035 2040 2045 2050\n2019 - 2020 NatWest Group estimates\n2021 NatWest Group estimate\nUK CCC \nBNZ Pathway\n2030 SBTi validated target\n2050 convergence point\nConvergence \npathway\nEstimates of financed emissions continued\nEnergy (Continued) \n Under or equal to the convergence pathway  Above convergence pathway by up to 5%  Above convergence pathway by more than 5%\n2021 NatWest Group estimate - RAG status\n86NatWest Group plc | 2022 Climate-related Disclosures Report\nGovernance Strategy and Climate transition plan Risk Management and Scenario Analysis Metrics and TargetsIntroduction\nEstimates of financed emissions continued\nAgriculture – Primary farming Primary farming\nFinanced emissions were estimated for primary farming activities (including fishing) and Land-Use, Land-Use \nChange and Forestry (LULUCF) with analysed exposures amounting to £4.1 billion at 31 December 2021 \n(£4.0 billion at 31 December 2019). Since 2019, emissions have decreased by 4% and emissions intensity increased. \nTo estimate financed emissions, we used revenue intensity by activity from the Exiobase database. This approach \nis necessary as primary farming activities do not have a homogenous unit of output base (i.e. farmers sell different \nproducts).\n • Exiobase is a global, detailed multi-regional environmentally extended supply use table and input-output table. \nExiobase was developed by harmonising and detailing supply use tables for a large number of countries, \nestimating emissions, and resource extractions by industry.\n • Exiobase was used to estimate revenue emissions intensity for different categories of primary farming at the \nsubsector level (such as cereal growing, dairy farming, etc). We then mapped the NatWest Group’s primary \nfarming categories to the Exiobase subsectors in order to use customer-level revenue data in conjunction with \nthe Exiobase revenue emissions intensities, to estimate emissions for primary farming.\nWe used the UK CCC BNZ scenario to create a pathway to 2050 net zero, estimating that the emission intensity \nof Primary Farming would need to reduce by 27% by 2030.\n • Emission intensity was estimated using revenue projections for the agriculture sector in the UK to 2050 based \non the assumption that food demand grows in line with the World Bank’s population forecasts for the UK.\n • The estimated convergence points for the agriculture sector are based on the estimates for a change in \ngrowth rate of population to determine agricultural output through 2050. This assumption draws on data \nfrom the World Bank population estimates (published annually).\nLULUCF\nThe agriculture sector has the potential for reduction in emissions and mitigation can be achieved through activities \nin the LULUCF sector that increase the removal of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere or decrease emissions \nby halting the loss of carbon stocks.\nDuring 2022, we analysed exposures to LULUCF-related activities and will continue to work with agriculture customers \nto support LULUCF activities further. Our work with the Sustainable Food Trust on the Global Farm Metric will support \nthis by providing detailed farm information so we can work with customers and support their transition.\nEstimated revenue intensity (tCO2e/£million)\n0\n500\n1,000\n1,500\n2,000\n2,500\n2019 2021 2025 2030 2035 2040 2045 2050\n2019 - 2020 NatWest Group estimates\n2021 NatWest Group estimate\nUK CCC \nBNZ Pathway\n2030 SBTi validated target\n2050 convergence point\nConvergence \npathway\n Under or equal to the convergence pathway  Above convergence pathway by up to 5%  Above convergence pathway by more than 5%\nFood\n2021 NatWest Group estimate - RAG status\n87NatWest Group plc | 2022 Climate-related Disclosures Report\nGovernance Strategy and Climate transition plan Risk Management and Scenario Analysis Metrics and TargetsIntroduction\nScenario selection\nIn addition to the estimation of baseline and current financed emissions, we estimate emissions reductions required \nin future years and have also set sectoral targets validated by the SBTi as science-based. This underpins the initial \niteration of our Climate transition plan and identification of further opportunities to support our customers’ transition \nto net zero.\nWe use scenarios that are recognised in the industry and developed by independent and respected organisations \nto assess forward-looking pathways for different sectors.
