Within days, our teams were \ntreating over 1,000 people a day. \nSince February 2022, LUX MED has provided 320,000 \nseparate health interventions to 180,000 refugees and \nemployed 240 healthcare workers. \nTo ensure help was provided where it was most \nurgently needed, LUX MED opened a Medical Centre for \nRefugees in the Marriott Hotel in the centre of Warsaw, \nwhich saw thousands of refugees flooding in from \nUkraine. A second was set up at the Ptak Warsaw Expo, \nwhere refugees could find shelter and stay for a period. \nWe have been offering emergency medical services \nat the Ukrainian border, with paramedics, doctors and \nequipment. All cost of this humanitarian aid has been \nabsorbed by Bupa. We’ve also made financial donations \nto UNICEF and through the LUX MED Foundation to \nsupport humanitarian efforts. \nWe’re committed to these facilities being in place \nfor as long as is needed so that Ukrainian people can \naccess free healthcare and so that medically trained \nUkrainians have facilities to practise in. \nWe continue to offer support for our people \nthrough our Healthy Minds service. We have also \ncreated a recruitment page for Ukrainian refugees \nwho might want to work for Bupa in the UK, \nparticularly technologists. \nIn addition to complying with applicable sanctions, \nBupa also adopted a policy of terminating any existing \nrelationships with businesses in Russia, or Russian-\ncontrolled entities globally, as quickly as possible, \nand we will not renew existing contracts with \nthese businesses. \nBupa Chief Executive Committee, Chairman Roger Davis and LUX MED healthcare workers at LUX MED's Medical Centre for Refugees in Warsaw. \nBupa Annual Report 2022 35 \n \n \n \n  \n  \n          \n          \n        \n          \n       \n        \n         \n         \n \n       \n      \n        \n   \n       \n          \n \n        \n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n          \n     \n         \n       \n          \n         \n          \n      \n            \n        \n         \n   \n         \n         \n    \n         \n        \n          \n         \n  \n          \n          \n         \n         \n      \n         \n         \n         \n         \n        \n       \n  \n        \n           \n     \n         \n         \n            \n         \n          \n        \n          \n   \n       \n        \n       \n           \n          \n         \n          \n        \n         \n       \n          \n    \n          \n  \n   \nStrategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements \nSection 172 statement \nPromoting the \nlong-term success \nand sustainability \nof Bupa \nSection 172 statement \nThis statement sets out how the Board has acted in \na way that promotes Bupa's success in achieving its \npurpose of helping people live longer, healthier, happier \nlives and making a better world.
