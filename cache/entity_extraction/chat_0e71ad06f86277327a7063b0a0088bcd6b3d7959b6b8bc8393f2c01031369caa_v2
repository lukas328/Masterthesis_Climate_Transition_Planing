Our products enable our customers  \nto create the chemicals and fuels of today and  \nthe future which positively impact the everyday \nlives of millions of people.\nWe have worked for decades in partnership with our customers to improve the efficiency \nand sustainability of their processes, but there is more we can do to reduce the environmental \nimpact of these chemicals and fuels across their full lifecycle. So we are developing robust \nsolutions with our customers that reduce their process emissions today while enabling them \nto replace fossil-based feedstocks with more sustainable options.\nSharpening our commercial focus in a changing world\nCatalyst Technologies has segment-leading positions in methanol, formaldehyde, and \nhydrogen – all technologies that build on our core strengths in syngas production, purification \nand conversion.\nWe’ve adapted our approach to our customers to make sure that we are creating value for \nboth them and us in a high inflationary and energy cost environment. \nWe are also driving awareness among current and new customers to the many ways Johnson \nMatthey as a whole can partner with them as their industries evolve.\nOur expertise underpins our suite of decarbonisation technologies, led by our low carbon \n(blue) hydrogen and our sustainable fuels offering. We are well placed to capture the sizeable \nopportunity presented by valorising non-fossil feedstocks like biomass, renewable (green) \nhydrogen and captured CO2 over the coming decades. But we can also help customers with \nexisting assets to minimise their environmental footprint as regulations tighten and carbon \ntaxes increase.\nIn line with our new strategy, we are transforming how we work so that we can take  \nfull advantage of the opportunities generated by the chemical industry’s decarbonisation \njourney and positioning our technologies to lie at the heart of the energy transition. \nHow Catalyst Technologies helps our customers\n• World-class catalysts and chemical processes – to get the most of their assets; increasing \nefficiency, maximising output, reducing both operational and capital expenditure\n• Carbon management – helping current asset owners reduce their environmental footprint \nand mitigate future financial impacts\n• Low carbon new energy – helping customers catalyse their plans for the energy transition \nwith technologies that can be deployed at scale now. \nSynergy in action\nWe are ensuring that all our customers are aware of the benefits brought by the shared \ntechnology, insight and ecosystem across Johnson Matthey.\nWe all know that transportation needs to decarbonise. However, there is no one technology \nthat meets the needs of every market. But we can provide a range of solutions, whether it’s \nhydrogen fuel cells, drop-in liquid hydrocarbon fuels, or emission control solutions for engines \nrunning on sustainable fuels. Our Bioforming™ technology, co-developed with Virent, \nproduces sustainable gasoline and aviation fuel, and in January, Emirates operated a \nmilestone demonstration flight, using fuel produced by our process blended to create 100% \nsustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in one of the engines of a Boeing 777-300ER. This is only \nmade possible by JM’s deep understanding of PGM chemistry and circularity, leveraging skills \nin PGMS. It’s why JM is better together.\nAnother synergy is in hydrogen, covering both production and use. From reducing the carbon \nintensity of current customers’ assets to producing components for green hydrogen that can \nbe used in e-fuels and chemicals, we’re ready to support our customers wherever they are \nin the journey.\nIndustrial and consumer Fuels\nMethanol\nIncluding paints, \ncoatings and \npolymers\n#1\nglobal segment \nposition\nFormaldehyde\nIncluding wood \nproducts\n#1\nglobal segment \nposition\nAmmonia\nIncluding fertilizers\nTop 3\nglobal segment \nposition\nTransportation fuelsNatural gasNatural gas \npurification\n#1\nglobal segment \nposition\nRefining  \nadditives\nTop 2\nglobal segment \nposition\nLeading in today’s markets\nRefinery  \nHydrogen\n#1\nglobal segment  \nposition\nIn the submarket segments in which we operate\nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 202318\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION\nReputation. Innovation. Commercialisation at scale\nOur reputation in process technology, coupled with our deep knowledge of metal chemistry \nand catalysis, is generating value today for our customers. And a growing part of our business \nwill be to innovate and deliver the technologies at scale to address tomorrow’s challenges.\nBuilding strong partnerships, both commercially and technically, is key to success in the move \nto a net zero world. A great example of this is our work with Honeywell UOP to integrate leading \ncarbon capture technology into our syngas decarbonisation technologies. In the case of our \nLCH™ technology, this collaboration creates a solution that delivers a 99% CO2 capture rate that \nis ready to be deployed today.\nMany of the critical innovations inside our emerging syngas offers, such as our HyCOgen™ \nreverse water gas shift and ammonia cracking licences, have their basis in technologies with \nproven real-world operation over decades in other markets. So our customers can be confident \nwe can help them decarbonise successfully.
