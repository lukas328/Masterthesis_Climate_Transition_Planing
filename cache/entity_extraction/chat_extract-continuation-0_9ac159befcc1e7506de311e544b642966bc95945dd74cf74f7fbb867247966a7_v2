claims relate to the Group’s insurance underwriting activities. \nInsurance claims incurred are amounts payable under insurance contracts \narising from the occurrence of an insured claims episode. A claims episode \nis an insured medical service that the Group has an obligation to fund, \nwhich could be consultation fees, diagnostic investigations, hospitalisation \nor treatment costs. This includes amounts in relation to claims episodes in \nAustralia that have not taken place by the reporting date where the Group \nhas a constructive obligation to fund deferred medical services, due to \nregulatory or other public commitments following periods of severe service \ndisruption, as has been the case with COVID-19. \nInsurance claims \nInsurance claims incurred comprise insurance claims paid during the year together with related handling costs, the \nmovement in the gross provision for claims in the period (which includes a deferred claims provision in respect of \nCOVID-19 disruption in the Australian health insurance business that was closed to future accrual of deferred claims \nfrom 1 October 2022) and the Risk Equalisation Special Account levy for the Australian health insurance business. \nSee Note 19.1 for details of the claims provision. \nPrivate health insurers in Australia provide private health insurance cover through a community rated scheme. To \navoid adverse selection and ensure the Australian private health insurance scheme is sustainable, a risk equalisation \nmechanism operates to subsidise insurers with higher risk policyholders. The amounts payable or receivable under \nthe Risk Specialisation Account are determined by APRA after the end of each quarter. Historically, Bupa has paid \neligible benefits above the average. \nReinsurers’ share of claims incurred \nReinsurers’ share of claims incurred represents recoveries from reinsurers on claims paid, adjusted for the \nreinsurers’ share of the change in the gross provision for claims. \nSee Note 12 for the related item in the Statement of Financial Position. \n2022 2021 \n£m £m \nInsurance claims paid 7,661 7,267 \nChange in gross provisions for claims¹ 108 88 \nRisk Equalisation Special Account levy (net of recoveries) (43) (61) \nInsurance claims incurred 7,726 7,294 \nRecoveries from reinsurers on claims incurred (94) (77) \nReinsurers’ share of change in gross provisions for claims (3) (2) \nReinsurers’ share of claims incurred (97) (79) \nNet insurance claims incurred 7,629 7,215 \n1.
