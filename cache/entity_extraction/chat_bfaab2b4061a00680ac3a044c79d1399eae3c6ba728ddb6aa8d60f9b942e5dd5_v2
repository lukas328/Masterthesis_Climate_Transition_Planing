train concepts: geared drive trains and gearless direct \ndrive generators � The amount of rare earth elements used in geared \ndrive trains is up to 10 times lower than the amounts used in direct \ndrive generators drivetrains � Today, all Vestas turbines are based on \ntechnology using the less rare earth intensive geared drive trains � \nWe use rare earth elements in our turbines because they make \ngenerators more efficient and more grid-compatible, improving \noverall performance � They also enable us to reduce the overall size of \nthe generator and power-train � This means we use fewer resources, \nsuch as steel and other structural materials, which in turn helps to \nreduce our carbon footprint � Furthermore, compared to previous \nmodels, our most recent EnVentus™ turbine uses significantly fewer \nlight rare earth materials per MW � In this variant, we have also \neliminated the use of heavy rare earth materials in the generator \naltogether� \nHowever, one of the gaps identified in our Human Rights \nAssessment (see page 39) related to rare earth minerals � In 2022, \nwe initiated a detailed mapping of our rare earth mineral use in \nspecific wind turbine platforms � We expect to finalise the analysis in \n2023 and use the results to further develop our risk frameworks and \nmanagement of these materials � \ndue diligence assessments \nconducted for

of Conduct, all suppliers are \nexpected to have their own reporting system in place � Supply chain \nworkers can use EthicsLine (see page 42) to raise any concerns they \nmay have� Cases raised via EthicsLine by a supply chain workers are \nhanded over to the applicable department(s) responsible for the \nscope of the raised concern � As such, cases from value chain workers \nwill not follow the standard governance for reported cases � Instead, \nthey will be handled separately in compliance with applicable \nprocesses for a sustainable supply chain by Sustainable \nProcurement � We have a zero-tolerance approach to retaliation \noutlined in the EthicsLine Policy �\nIn 2022, no reports have been shared for further investigation \nrelated to concerns raised about supply chain workers � We aim to \nuse our implemented processes to effectively reduce, and try to \neliminate, risk to supply chain workers � Our target is that any concern \nreported via EthicsLine is investigated and managed thoroughly � \nSupply chain planning and forecast sharing\nWe share forecasts with our suppliers to reduce the risk of contribut -\ning to or causing material negative impact to the supply chain \nworkers � In 2022, we successfully implemented the latest module of \nour Digital Supply Chain Collaboration tool, which enables us to work \nmore efficiently with our suppliers, receive real time data on \ndeliveries and orders, and collaborate with our suppliers on \nforecasts and upcoming activities in our supply chain � \nOur forecasts serve as a planning tool, which also enables our \nsuppliers to estimate the necessary materials and the work force \nneeded to fill our orders � However, it is important to underline that \nthe forecasts are a rough estimate, and final purchase orders may \nvary in volume once placed �\nWe also participate in WindEurope’s supply chain taskforce, helping \nthe industry map supply chain risks, and we take a collective \napproach to mitigate these risks using our collateral leverage � \nOur overall framework is established with the intention of support -\ning Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 8 Decent Work and \nEconomic Growth,

the overall performance \nevaluation � \nThe survey enables us to measure the maturity of suppliers in health \n& safety, environmental, and social sustainability on a quarterly \nbasis� It includes, but is not limited to, questions about whether \nsuppliers measure CO 2e emissions and set reduction targets for \ntheir activities, whether they measure and have set a target for their \nscope 3 emissions, and if they are committed to science-based \ntargets to reduce CO 2e emissions� We also collect information on our \nsuppliers related to the use of renewable electricity, their waste \nreduction efforts, and the amount of recycled content in products \nsupplied to Vestas � \nIn 2022, the Safety & Sustainability survey was distributed to \napproximately 230 key suppliers � Throughout the year, we achieved \nan average score of 83 percent across all suppliers, exceeding our \naverage target score of 80 percent � By the end of 2022, our \nengagement resulted in improved sustainability performance for \napproximately 50 percent of suppliers who received the survey �\nThe assessment ensures we capture an overview of our supplier's \nsustainability performance and helps us prioritise our engagement � \nWe conduct performance dialogues with all scorecard suppliers \nwhich, for low-performing suppliers from any segment, follow up on \nperformance and action plans until
