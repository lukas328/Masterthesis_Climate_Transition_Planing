It is essential that our trans colleagues can be themselves at work and that we \nsupport them, their manager and HR colleagues.\nAdvancing diversity, inclusion and belonging\nInnovation requires diversity of thought, background and representation as well as a culture \nof inclusion and belonging. Our success depends on people feeling that they can speak up, \ntalk about ideas, challenge norms and create more value for our customers. \nThis year we replaced our Equal Opportunities Policy with a Global Diversity, Inclusion \n& Belonging (DI&B) Policy.\nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 202336\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION\nSustainability continued\nPeople: Promoting a safe, diverse and equitable society continued\nFair pay \nEnsuring our employees are paid fairly for their work also forms part of our core value to \nprotect people and the planet. In the UK, we are an accredited Living Wage Employer and \nwe are exploring to what extent we can apply a living wage policy globally. \nWe recognise that employees are facing a cost-of-living crisis, and in our most recent pay \nreviews we increased our pay budgets to recognise this. For non-unionised employees our \nglobal salary budget was split for management and non-management roles with non- \nmanagement roles receiving a higher budget. In addition to their pay increase, employees \nwho fell below the average JM wage in a country where price inflation was abnormally high \nwere given a temporary supplementary allowance. For example, in the UK the non-\nmanagement budget was 4.5% and the management budget was 3.75%. In the UK, this \nequated to £50 per month until 31st March 2023 for employees earning £40,000 or less \n(on a full-time basis). The lowest salary agreement made with our UK unions was a 4.5% \nsalary increase and a £600 lump sum, among other local arrangements \nIn addition to our employees’ pay, we have provided support through Assist, which provides \nJM employees and dependants with access to a team of highly trained and qualified \nprofessionals on a variety of financial well-being topics such as debt management, mortgages \nand loans; in addition to broader mental, physical and social well-being topics. Our temporary \nemployees received the same benefits as our permanent employees.\nFreedom of association \nWe respect and promote the rights of people to freedom of association. In 2022/23 a quarter \nof our people globally were covered by collective bargaining agreements and / or represented \nby trade unions.\nWe work collaboratively with 23 trade unions across our sites, focusing on a range of topics, \nsuch as health & safety, well-being, business change needs, employee training and improving \nthe way we work at our local sites. Cost-of-living was a significant part of our union \nnegotiations this year and, for those negotiations that have already concluded, we have \nagreed larger wage increases than normal and an additional special cost of living lump sum. \nWe also support engagement at regional and national levels where needed.\n2022/23 Union representation % represented\nAverage number of \nemployees \nrepresented\nTotal average \nnumber of \nemployees1\nUK 21%\nRest of Europe 24% 668 2,734\nNorth America 17% 397 2,271\nAsia 27% 660 2,442\nRest of World 52% 545 1,057\nWorkforce globally 25% 3,163 12,666\nWe issue a gender pay gap report in accordance with UK law.
