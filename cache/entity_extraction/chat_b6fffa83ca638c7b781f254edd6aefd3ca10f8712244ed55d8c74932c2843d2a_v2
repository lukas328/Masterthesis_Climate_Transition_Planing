That’s why we \nare so proud to have achieved our 2025 Scope 1 and 2 \ndecarbonisation targets for our own operations three \nyears ahead of plan. We will use this as a platform to  \ngo even further on eliminating and reducing our \noperational emissions and scaling up our engagement \nwith key suppliers. \n \nI am hugely excited to be writing this foreword for our \nNet Zero Transition Plan, which marks an important step \non our journey to becoming a net zero business by 2050. \n \nAs the UK’s largest long-term savings and retirement \nbusiness, we recognise our responsibility to tackle \nclimate change. By taking the right actions to \ndecarbonise, we believe that we can manage the risks \nand maximise the opportunities of climate change on \nbehalf of our 12 million customers. And with close to  \n£0.3 trillion assets under administration, our scale  \nmeans we can make a real difference. \n \nOver the last two years, many companies have set \nincreasingly ambitious targets to reduce emissions – and \nPhoenix Group has been at the forefront of this process. \nBut targets alone are not enough: the scale and urgency \nof the climate crisis and the action needed to tackle it \nmeans that robust plans to meet targets must urgently  \nbe put in place. \n \nOur Net Zero Transition Plan sets out the actions we are \ntaking to become net zero by 2050 and achieve our \nstretching interim targets in 2025 and 2030 across our \ninvestment portfolio, operations and supply chain. It \ngives us confidence that we are on the right track – but is \ntransparent about where we need to do more and where \nwe are dependent on action from others. It also helps to \nensure that our decarbonisation plans are aligned with \nour wider business objectives and deliver the right \noutcomes for our customers. We have developed it in line \nwith the latest industry guidance from the Transition Plan \nTaskforce and Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero.\nAn important step on our journey to net zero\nAndy Briggs \nGroup Chief \nExecutive Officer\n3\nPhoenix Group Holdings plc Net Zero Transition Plan\nInvest\n Engage\n Lead\nEmbedding net zero \nin our business\nBecoming a \nnet zero business\nExecutive \nsummary Measuring our progress\n\nOur commitment 5\nOur Net Zero Transition Plan 6\nDecarbonising the portfolio 7\nEffective stewardship of our assets 8\nInvesting in climate solutions 9\nEngaging customers and driving system change 10\nLeading by decarbonising our operations\nand supply chain 11\nSummary 12\nOur Net Zero Transition Plan marks an important step on  \nour journey to becoming a net zero business by 2050 across  \nour investment portfolio, operations and supply chain.\nExecutive  \nsummary\n4\nPhoenix Group Holdings plc Net Zero Transition Plan\nInvest Engage Lead\nEmbedding net zero \nin our business\nBecoming a \nnet zero business\nExecutive \nsummary Measuring our progress\nWe are clear on what we want to achieve,  \nwhere we currently are and what it \nwill take to get there.\n• We recognise our responsibility to tackle climate \nchange – and want to use our capacity to drive real \neconomy decarbonisation. \n• We are starting to take tangible actions at scale – \nas we move beyond setting targets and planning,  \nto delivering real impact.  \n• We have put customers at the heart of our plan – \neverything we do has their best interest at its core. \nBy taking the right actions to decarbonise, we can help \nour customers grow their investments and protect them \nagainst risk.\n• We believe we are on track to deliver our 2025 target \n– if the actions we have committed to are implemented, \nbut will likely need to do more to  \nachieve our 2030 targets – although the challenge  \nof predicting economy-wide decarbonisation and  \nthe effect this has on our own performance makes \nforecasting inherently uncertain.\n• We cannot deliver net zero alone  – and are going to \nbe vocal in calling for action from others and want to \nconvene action across our ecosystem.\nWe have already  \ndelivered some big wins. \n• Brought our sustainable multi-asset strategies to 1.5m \nworkplace pension scheme members, which applies \na decarbonisation strategy to all equities, ~£12b AUA  \n• Preparing to roll out bespoke decarbonisation indices \nto US and UK equities across all policyholder funds – \nc.£40 billion AUA1.\n• Launched stewardship engagement with 25 priority \ncompanies which account for 40%^ of financed \nemissions in highly emitting sectors.\n• Goal to invest up to £40 billion in sustainable and/or \nproductive assets including climate solutions with the \nright regulatory, policy and market conditions.\n• Achieved our 2025 Scope 1 and 2 intensity-based \ndecarbonisation target of 80% against our 2019 \nbaseline for our own operations three years ahead  \nof plan.\nWe have aligned our plan with  \nindustry guidance\nWe have developed our Net Zero Transition Plan in line \nwith the latest industry guidance from the Transition Plan \nTaskforce (‘TPT’) and Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net \nZero (‘GFANZ’).
