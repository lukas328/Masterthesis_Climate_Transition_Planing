Thatâs why we \nare so proud to have achieved our 2025 Scope 1 and 2 \ndecarbonisation targets for our own operations three \nyears ahead of plan. We will use this as a platform to  \ngo even further on eliminating and reducing our \noperational emissions and scaling up our engagement \nwith key suppliers. \n \nI am hugely excited to be writing this foreword for our \nNet Zero Transition Plan, which marks an important step \non our journey to becoming a net zero business by 2050. \n \nAs the UKâs largest long-term savings and retirement \nbusiness, we recognise our responsibility to tackle \nclimate change. By taking the right actions to \ndecarbonise, we believe that we can manage the risks \nand maximise the opportunities of climate change on \nbehalf of our 12 million customers. And with close to  \nÂ£0.3 trillion assets under administration, our scale  \nmeans we can make a real difference. \n \nOver the last two years, many companies have set \nincreasingly ambitious targets to reduce emissions â and \nPhoenix Group has been at the forefront of this process. \nBut targets alone are not enough: the scale and urgency \nof the climate crisis and the action needed to tackle it \nmeans that robust plans to meet targets must urgently  \nbe put in place. \n \nOur Net Zero Transition Plan sets out the actions we are \ntaking to become net zero by 2050 and achieve our \nstretching interim targets in 2025 and 2030 across our \ninvestment portfolio, operations and supply chain. It \ngives us confidence that we are on the right track â but is \ntransparent about where we need to do more and where \nwe are dependent on action from others. It also helps to \nensure that our decarbonisation plans areÂ aligned with \nour wider business objectives and deliver the right \noutcomes for our customers.
