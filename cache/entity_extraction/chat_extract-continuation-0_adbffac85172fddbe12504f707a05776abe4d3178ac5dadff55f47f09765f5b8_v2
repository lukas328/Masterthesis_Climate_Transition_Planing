A further -3%p came from a change in the denominator9 of the carbon \nfootprinting method, aligning with emerging regulatory standards. Real-world emission reductions by \ninvestee companies contributed -6%p, which shows that stronger short-term actions by investee companies \non emission reductions are necessary.  \n \nHerewith, we are presenting our 2030 targets, in line with our promise to continuously expand the scope of \ntargets. They have been developed with learnings from the Target Setting Protocol of the Net-Zero Asset \nOwner Alliance (NZAOA), of which Allianz was one of the founding organizations and holds the Chair \nposition. The targets expand across four different target dimensions, sub-portfolios, sectors, engagement \nand climate solution investments. \n \nFor our corporate portfolio, we now aim to reduce -50% by 2030 compared with our base year 2019. For \ntraded equity and corporate bonds, this is an absolute target. For all corporate, including infrastructure, \nprivate equity and debt, and similar, it is an additional intensity target. It expands to almost half of our \ntotal proprietary investment portfolio of 701 bn EUR as of 31.12.2022.
