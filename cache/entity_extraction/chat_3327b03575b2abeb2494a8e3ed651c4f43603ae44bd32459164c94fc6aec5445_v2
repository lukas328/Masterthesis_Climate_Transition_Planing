The \nperformance of the group’s operating sectors is assessed on sales and underlying operating \nprofit (see note 34). Sales between segments are made at market prices, taking into account \nthe volumes involved. \nHealth was sold during the financial year and its results are therefore presented within \ndiscontinued operations.

The new Standard establishes the principles for the recognition, measurement, \npresentation and disclosure of insurance contracts within the scope of the Standard. The \nobjective of IFRS 17 is to ensure that an entity provides relevant information that faithfully \nrepresents those contracts. \nThe group has performed an assessment to establish where an impact is expected and \nconsiders the impact of this new standard to be immaterial. \nNon-GAAP measures \nThe group uses various measures to manage its business which are not defined by generally \naccepted accounting principles (GAAP). The group’s management believes these measures \nprovide valuable additional information to users of the accounts in understanding the group’s \nperformance. The group’s non-GAAP measures are defined and reconciled to GAAP measures \nin note 34.  \n2 Segmental information \nRevenue, sales and underlying operating profit by business \nAs announced in our preliminary full year results in May 2022, we have changed our reporting \nstructure for the year ending 31st March 2023. The new reporting structure provides greater \ntransparency and reflects how we manage our business. Efficient Natural Resources was split \ninto two separate segments (PGM Services and Catalyst Technologies), and Hydrogen \nTechnologies and Value Businesses are now separate operating segments (previously included \nwithin Other Markets). Excluding Corporate, the group has five reporting segments, aligned to \nthe needs of our customers and the global challenges we are tackling.  \nClean Air – provides catalysts for emission control after-treatment systems used in light and \nheavy duty vehicles powered by internal combustion engines. \nPGM Services – enables the energy transition through providing circular solutions as demand \nfor scarce critical materials increases. Provides a strategic service to the group, supporting the \nother segments with security of metal supply, and manufactures value add PGM products. \nCatalyst Technologies – enables the decarbonisation of chemical and fuel value chains. \nHydrogen Technologies – provides catalyst coated membranes that are a critical component \nfor fuel cells and electrolysers. \nValue Businesses – a portfolio of businesses managed to drive shareholder value from \nactivities considered to be non-core to the Group. This includes Battery Systems, Medical \nDevice Components and Diagnostic Services1. Refer to note 27 for further information on the \ndisposal of Battery Materials. Advanced Glass Technologies was sold on 31st January 2022 and \nis included within the prior period balances. \nThe Group Leadership Team (the chief operating decision maker as defined by IFRS 8, \nOperating Segments) monitors the results of these operating sectors to assess performance \nand make decisions about the allocation of resources. Each operating sector is represented by \na member of the Group Leadership Team. These operating sectors represent the group’s \nreportable segments and their principal activities are described on pages 56 to 59. The \nperformance of the group’s operating sectors is assessed on sales and underlying operating \nprofit (see note 34).
