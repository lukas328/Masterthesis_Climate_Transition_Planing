Our public disclosures, including our voluntary environmental, \nsocial and governance (ESG) and climate-related disclosures, include a range of topics that we \nbelieve are relevant to our businesses and that are of interest to investors and other stakeholders. \nWe use the definition of materiality established under U.S. federal securities laws for the purposes \nof complying with the disclosure rules and regulations promulgated by the U.S. Securities and \nExchange Commission (SEC) and applicable stock exchange listing standards. However , our voluntary \nESG disclosures consider broader definitions of materiality promulgated by other frameworks and \nreporting guidelines that take into consideration a wider range of factors, including the views of \nstakeholders and our ambition to play a leading role in financing the energy transition. \nFor the purposes of discussing climate risks and opportunities in this TCFD Report, we use an \napproach to materiality that is consistent with the TCFD recommendations. Therefore, this report \nincorporates a climate change “double materiality” perspective — looking at both the climate’s impact \non our company, and our company’s impact on climate — and, for example, uses longer time frames \nto assess potential impacts than those time frames customarily used in our required disclosures, \nincluding those mandated by SEC rules and regulations. This layered approach means that this TCFD \nReport and many of our other voluntary disclosures capture details on ESG issues, including climate-\nrelated risks and opportunities that may not be, and are not necessary to be, incorporated into \nour required disclosures. Our approach to materiality in this TCFD Report and other voluntary ESG \ndisclosures also means that statements made in this report and in our other voluntary disclosures \nuse a greater number of assumptions and estimates than many of our required disclosures. These \nassumptions and estimates are likely to change over time, and, when coupled with the longer time \nframes used in these voluntary disclosures, make any assessment of materiality inherently uncertain. \nIn addition, our climate risk management efforts and net zero strategy remain under development, \nand the data underlying our climate risk management efforts and strategy are expected to evolve \nover time, particularly given ongoing challenges related to the quality, accuracy and quantity of \nclimate data. As a result, we anticipate that certain disclosures made in this report and our other \nvoluntary ESG disclosures are likely to be amended, updated or restated in the future as the quality \nand completeness of our data and methodologies continue to improve. \nTCFD REPORT 2022: CITI’S APPROACH TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND NET ZERO | 11\nCiti’s climate governance structure continues to evolve as we advance our understanding of Citi’s climate \nrisk and our progress under the Net Zero Plan. Since our 2021 TCFD Report, we have:\n • Expanded our Board of Directors’ oversight of certain climate-related matters such as climate risk \nand climate and ESG disclosures. Codified the integration of climate-related issues with certain \nBoard committees, including incorporating oversight of our climate disclosure risk and controls \nenvironment into the Audit Committee (AC) charter and climate risk oversight into the Risk \nManagement Committee (RMC) charter;\n • Commenced an ESG Disclosure Committee to support the Board and AC and provide oversight of \nCiti’s disclosure controls and procedures;\n • Expanded and realigned our Climate Risk team to be part of the Enterprise Risk Management \nfunction within Risk and further added subject matter expertise; \n • Launched two climate training pilots for our BCMA (Banking, Capital Markets and Advisory), Risk \nManagement and Global Functions teams involving in-person workshops focused on providing \nfoundational knowledge of climate risks and client transition plans;\n • Further built out our Clean Energy Transition (CET) team (formed in 2021 and expanded in 2022 \nto include Corporate Banking), which focuses on providing advisory and capital-raising services to \ncompanies involved in energy transition;\n • Expanded capacity of our Sustainability & Corporate Transitions (SCT) team to cover the Asia \nPacific (APAC) region with new team members based in Singapore and Australia, and formed an \nSCT Corporate Banking Team; and\n • Established a new management position — the Head of Net Zero Operations — to provide leadership \nand expertise to help us reach our net zero operations commitment.\nOur 2021 TCFD Report included a diagram which illustrated our climate governance structure. The \nfollowing diagram is an updated version of last year’s structure and reflects the changes Citi made since \nour last TCFD Report.\n \nGovernance\n \nPART 2\n12 | TCFD REPORT 2022: CITI’S
