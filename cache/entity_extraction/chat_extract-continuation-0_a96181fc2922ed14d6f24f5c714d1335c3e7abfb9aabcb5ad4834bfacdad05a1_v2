value hierarchy levels \nThe Group’s policy is to determine whether transfers have occurred between fair value hierarchy levels at the end \nof a reporting period. Classification is reassessed based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value \nmeasurement as a whole. In 2022, there were no transfers between fair value hierarchy levels. In 2021, £48m of \ngovernment debt securities and corporate debt securities and secured loans were transferred from Level 1 to Level \n2 following a review of the level of market activity and readily available quoted prices in those investments, £13m \nfrom Level 2 to Level 1 and £1m from Level 2 to Level 3. \nFair values for Level 2 assets mainly include values provided by external parties, including fund managers, which \nare either from readily available prices (including last transaction price) but relate to assets for which the market is \nnot always active, or are measured on the basis of valuation techniques including a varying degree of assumptions \nsupported by market transactions and observable data. \nThe Group currently holds Level 3 investments totalling £63m. The majority of Level 3 investments are unlisted \nequities and pooled investment funds valued at the recent subscription value and conversion price, which are \nconsidered to be unobservable inputs. Reasonably possible changes to the valuation assumptions applied could \nresult in a change in fair value of plus or minus £3m. \nThe table below shows movement in the Level 3 assets measured at fair value. \n2022 2021 \nLevel 3 £m £m \nAt beginning of year 34 \nAdditions 4 \nNet increase in fair value 24 \nTransfer between levels – \nForeign exchange 1 \nAt end of year¹ 63 \n28 \n2 \n4 \n1 \n(1) \n34 \n1. All gains and losses are recognised in net financial expense in the Consolidated Income Statement. \nThere were no transfers in 2022. In 2021, transfers into Level 3 financial assets reflected changes in the availability \nof observable inputs used in the valuation of those assets. \nThe Group uses a market interest curve supported by third parties as at the reporting date to discount financial \nassets, borrowings and derivatives, where the fair value cannot otherwise be found from quoted market values. \nThe interest rate used is based on the duration of the financial asset/liability resulting in a range as follows: \n2022 2021 \n% % \nSterling assets and liabilities 3.4 - 3.7 0.9 - 1.1 \nAustralian dollar assets and liabilities 3.3 - 3.7 0.3 - 1.4 \nEuro assets and liabilities 2.5 - 2.6 (0.7) - 0.2 \nUS dollar assets and liabilities 3.9 - 4.6 0.4 - 1.9 \nBupa Annual Report 2022 163 \n \n   \n              \n         \n           \n     \n                \n                 \n                 \n               \n              \n           \n                \n                 \n                   \n     \n           \n \n \n    \n    \n      \n \n    \n    \n      \n          \n      \n   \nStrategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements \nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \ncontinued \nNote 10: \nDerivatives \nDerivatives in brief \nA derivative is a financial instrument whose value is based on one or more \nunderlying variables. The Group uses derivative financial instruments to \nhedge its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. Derivatives \nare not held for speculative reasons. \nDerivative financial instruments are accounted for at fair value through profit or loss unless hedge accounting \nrequires another treatment. See Note 26 for details on how the Group accounts for derivatives that qualify \nfor hedge accounting. Derivatives that have been purchased or issued as part of a hedge that subsequently \ndo not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for at fair value through profit or loss. \nFair values are obtained from market observable pricing information including interest rate yield curves. \nFair values have been calculated for each type of derivative as follows: \n▪ The\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DEBT SECURITIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Debt securities are financial instruments representing a loan made by an investor to a borrower, which can be corporate or government, and are classified based on their amortised cost, fair value, and level in hierarchy)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Corporate debt securities are debt instruments issued by corporations to raise capital, secured or unsecured, and are part of the financial investments portfolio)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOVERNMENT DEBT SECURITIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Government debt securities are debt instruments issued by governments to finance public spending, and are included in the financial investments)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEPOSITS WITH CREDIT INSTITUTIONS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Deposits with credit institutions are funds deposited in banks or similar financial entities, forming part of the investments)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POOLED INVESTMENT FUNDS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pooled investment funds are collective investment schemes that pool capital from multiple investors to invest in diversified assets, including debt securities and equities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EQUITIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Equities represent ownership shares in companies, included in the investment portfolio, with valuation based on market prices)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FAIR VALUE THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS<|>EVENT<|>A classification of financial assets where changes in fair value are recognized directly in profit or loss, including corporate and government debt securities, pooled funds, and other loans)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FAIR VALUE THROUGH OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME<|>EVENT<|>A classification of financial assets where changes in fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income, including certain corporate and government debt securities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEVEL 1, LEVEL 2, LEVEL 3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Levels in the fair value hierarchy indicating the observability and valuation techniques used for financial assets, with Level 3 representing unobservable inputs and unlisted equities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEVEL 3 INVESTMENTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Level 3 investments are unlisted equities and pooled funds valued at recent subscription and conversion prices, with a valuation sensitivity of approximately ±£3m)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hierarchy levels (Level 1, 2, 3) classify assets based on the observability of inputs used in valuation, affecting how changes in market conditions impact asset valuation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DERIVATIVES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Derivative financial instruments are contracts whose value depends on underlying variables like interest rates or foreign exchange rates, used for hedging purposes and accounted for at fair value)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEDGE ACCOUNTING<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hedge accounting is a method that aligns the accounting for derivatives with the underlying hedged item, reducing volatility in financial statements)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTEREST RATE YIELD CURVES<|>GEO<|>Market observable data used to determine fair values of derivatives and other financial instruments, reflecting current market conditions)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES<|>GOVERNMENT DEBT SECURITIES<|>Both are types of debt securities included in the financial investments portfolio<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>POOLED INVESTMENT FUNDS<|>EQUITIES<|>Pooled funds may include investments in equities as part of their diversified holdings<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LEVEL 3<|>FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY<|>Level 3 assets are unlisted and valued using unobservable inputs, representing the least observable level<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DERIVATIVES<|>HEDGE ACCOUNTING<|>Derivatives may qualify for hedge accounting to match their gains and losses with the underlying exposures<|>6)\n##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
