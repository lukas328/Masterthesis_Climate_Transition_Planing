The team is positive on the structural reforms under \nPresident Hichilema, which are likely to boost foreign direct investment over the \ncoming years while also improving institutional quality and capacity. \nThe Multi-Asset team uses a thematic macro framework to identify big-picture \ntailwinds and headwinds that may influence investment outcomes. Climate \nchange is one of the themes addressed in the framework. The team believes \nthat growing recognition of the severity of climate change is prompting global \nchanges in production and consumption systems, in turn creating transition \nrisks for countries and industries, as well as opportunities for businesses able \nto promote decarbonisation. An output of this research in 2023 was exposure \nin some of our multi-asset portfolios to companies promoting and facilitating \ndecarbonisation. They included a leading manufacturer of batteries for electric \nvehicles (EVs) and energy storage solutions (ESS). The investment case for \nthe company is supported by forecasted rapid electrification of transport and \nincreasing battery energy storage adoption.\nMulti-Asset\nWith a proprietary approach to sustainability analysis, the Emerging Market \nAlternative Credit team believes that ESG assessments enhance its fundamental \nresearch, improve its understanding of credit risk, and support the quality of \ninvestment decision-making. To this end, the team has developed an ESG toolkit for \nall of its credit strategies.\nThis analysis helped the team play a key role in structuring and advancing its first \nESG-related loan for Balwin Properties Ltd., a sectional title property developer in \nSouth Africa contributing to the residential needs of South Africa’s growing low-to-\nmiddle income population. The loan, which was advanced via the Ninety One Credit \nOpportunities strategy, embeds ESG-related targets and is the first in the South \nAfrican residential property real-estate market to incorporate financial savings for \nhomebuyers as one of its targets, alongside energy and water-saving targets. The \nfinancial savings contribute to financial inclusion via interest savings on mortgages, \nfacilitated by Balwin’s green-bond initiative, a partnership between the developer and \nlocal banks, as well lower utility costs. Balwin’s cost of funding is adjusted downwards \nbased on the achievement of these targets, thereby incentivising ESG improvements. \nAdditionally, the loan enables Balwin to build core infrastructure, addressing South \nAfrica’s infrastructure investment gap.\nAlternatives\nMulti-Asset: from big-picture perspective \nto single-stock selection\nEmerging Market Alternative Credit: \nempowering sustainable living in South Africa\nDeveloping new sustainability \nassessment frameworks to \nsupport ESG integration\nDiversity, equity and inclusion\nDuring the reporting year, some of our investment teams began \nusing a proprietary analysis toolkit (developed with the assistance of \nNinety One’s Human Capital function) to inform our investment teams’ \nassessments of companies on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). Failure \nto address DEI can result in a variety of risks to a company; appropriately \nmanaged, it is a potential source of competitive advantage, particularly for \npeople-centred businesses. Our framework is designed to help investment \nteams identify whether a company’s DEI strategy is, at a minimum, \nsufficient to mitigate downside risk (particularly reputational risk) and \nwhether the company recognises DEI as an important source of potential \ncompetitive advantage. Please see the ESG integration case study above, \n‘Quality investment team: exploring the social side of gaming’ .\nJust Transition\nWe developed a Just Transition framework to enable more \ncomprehensive assessments of the social elements of companies’ \ntransition plans. The International Labour Organisation defines ‘ Just \nTransition’ as “greening the economy in a way that is as fair and \ninclusive as possible to everyone concerned”. See ‘Transitioning our \ninvestments to net zero’ on the following page.\nNature and biodiversity\nNature and biodiversity will be a focus of our sustainability work in 2024. \nFollowing the recommendations of the Taskforce on Nature-related \nFinancial Disclosures, during the reporting period we reviewed our \ninvestment teams’ existing processes for assessing and managing nature-\nrelated risks and opportunities, and analysed data for our overall exposure \nto nature-related risks. We are now developing a strategy for assessing \nand managing nature and biodiversity risks, dependencies and impacts \nat a firmwide level. We also joined Nature Action 100, a global investor \nengagement initiative focused on driving greater corporate ambition and \naction to reverse nature and biodiversity loss. The initiative will engage \ncompanies in sectors that are deemed to be systemically important in \nreversing nature and biodiversity loss by 2030. Ninety One is participating \nin Nature Action 100 collective engagements with four companies as co-\nleads, and in addition co-signed a letter sent to 100 companies setting out \ninvestor expectations around nature-related risks. \n21\nSustainability and Stewardship Report2121\nTransitioning our \ninvestments to net zero\nTo deliver on our net-zero investment targets, we have identified four \nareas of action:\n1. Assessment\nAs shareholders, we have a role to play in motivating companies to \nset ambitious and credible transition plans. We also need to assess \ncompanies on their approach to transitioning to better understand \ninvestment risks and opportunities. Our proprietary Transition Plan \nAssessments (TPA) methodology is a key tool we use to achieve \nthese ends, as well as to inform our engagement strategy. Our TPAs \nfocus on three key factors: level of ambition, credibility of plan and \nimplementation of plan.\nDuring the reporting year, we evolved the TPA to reflect differences in \nhow some industries will decarbonise. By tailoring certain indicators, \nwe have focused the assessments more precisely on the areas of \nhighest net-zero impact for each\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HICHILEMA<|>PERSON<|>President of Zambia, advocating for structural reforms to boost foreign direct investment and improve institutional quality in the country)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MULTI-ASSET<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Investment team utilizing thematic macro frameworks to identify investment tailwinds and headwinds, including themes like climate change and decarbonisation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLIMATE CHANGE<|>EVENT<|>Global environmental issue prompting changes in production and consumption systems, creating transition risks and opportunities for businesses)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BATTERY MANUFACTURER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Leading producer of batteries for electric vehicles (EVs) and energy storage solutions (ESS), supporting rapid electrification and energy storage adoption)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EMERGING MARKET ALTERNATIVE CREDIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Investment team focused on ESG assessments, credit risk analysis, and structuring ESG-related loans, including a notable loan to Balwin Properties Ltd. in South Africa)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BALWIN PROPERTIES LTD.<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sectional title property developer in South Africa, contributing to affordable housing and implementing ESG targets through green-bond initiatives and infrastructure development)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOUTH AFRICA<|>GEO<|>Country with growing low-to-middle income population, infrastructure needs, and active in ESG and sustainable development initiatives)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NINETY ONE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Financial services firm providing research, credit strategies, and development of ESG and DEI assessment frameworks, including collaboration with Human Capital functions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTERNATIONAL LABOUR ORGANISATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>International agency defining ‘Just Transition’ as greening the economy in a fair and inclusive manner)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATURE AND BIODIVERSITY<|>EVENT<|>Focus of sustainability work in 2024, involving assessment and management of nature-related risks and participation in initiatives like Nature Action 100)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATURE ACTION 100<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Global investor engagement initiative aimed at reversing nature and biodiversity loss by 2030, involving collective engagement with companies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TASKFORCE ON NATURE-RELATED FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>International initiative providing recommendations for assessing and managing nature-related risks in investments)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRANSITION PLAN<|>EVENT<|>Framework for assessing companies’ transition strategies towards net zero, focusing on ambition, credibility, and implementation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NINETY ONE'S TRANSITION PLAN ASSESSMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Methodology used to evaluate companies’ decarbonisation plans, tailored to industry-specific decarbonisation pathways)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HICHILEMA<|>SOUTH AFRICA<|>President Hichilema's support for reforms aims to attract investment and improve governance in South Africa<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MULTI-ASSET<|>BATTERY MANUFACTURER<|>Multi-Asset team’s exposure to a battery manufacturer supports themes of decarbonisation and energy transition<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EMERGING MARKET ALTERNATIVE CREDIT<|>BALWIN PROPERTIES LTD.<|>The credit team structured a loan to Balwin Properties with ESG targets, supporting sustainable housing<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BALWIN PROPERTIES LTD.<|>SOUTH AFRICA<|>Balwin operates in South Africa, contributing to affordable housing and infrastructure development<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NINETY ONE<|>INTERNATIONAL LABOUR ORGANISATION<|>Ninety One developed a Just Transition framework based on ILO definitions<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATURE AND BIODIVERSITY<|>NATURE ACTION 100<|>Participation in Nature Action 100 aligns with efforts to reverse biodiversity loss<|>6)\n##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
