It is also \na member of the PCAF initiative, which \nestablishes an international methodology \nfor measuring and reporting financed \ngreenhouse gas emissions. \nBBVA has published intermediate alignment \ngoals for 2030 in the sectors of power \ngeneration, oil & gas, autos, steel and \ncement, and the goal coal phase-out in 2030 \nin developed countries and 2040 in the rest \nof the geographies where it operates under \nthe terms indicated in its Environmental and \nSocial Framework. Intermediate targets for \nthe alignment of the aviation and maritime \ntransport sectors are scheduled to be \npublished in 2023.\nBBVA discloses in this TCFD its first annual \nprogress measurement report for the \n5 sectors in which it set alignment targets in \n2021: power generation, autos, steel, cement \nand coal. The extent of progress is not \ndisclosed for the oil & gas sector as it has set \ntargets in October 2022. The methodology \nchosen, adapted for each sector, follows \nthe recommendations of the NZBA and the \nGuidelines for Climate T arget Setting for \nBanks published by UNEP-FI.\nThe following table presents, for the sectors \nin which decarbonization objectives have \nbeen defined, the details of the metrics \nchosen, the scope of emissions considered, \nthe metric of the current situation, absolute \nemissions, the methodology used and the \nobjective decarbonization by 2030:\nP.  73\nBBVA Report on TCFD 2022\nThis English version is a translation of the original in Spanish for information purposes only.

These NACE sectors comprise more sectors than those included in the PACTA \ncalculation since PACTA is only calculated on the point in the value chain where most of the emissions are generated. This calculation is carried out in this way because, based on the PACTA methodology, it is assumed that by aligning the part of the value chain responsible for \nemissions, the sector as a whole is aligned. The calculation has been carried out using the PCAF methodology and includes the emissions of BBVA.S.A. except Portugal branches.\n*Phase-out 2030 in developed countries and 2040 in the rest of the geographies where it operates, under the terms provided in the Environmental and Social \nFramework.(3) Total commitment (€mn)\nThe information included in the table above \n(minus the breakdown on the coal sector) \nhas been obtained from the consolidated \nNon-financial information report, which is \npart of the BBVA Group’s 2022 Consolidated \nManagement Report.
