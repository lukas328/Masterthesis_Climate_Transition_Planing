Pledges were made by 28 companies \nrepresenting different sectors from mining to energy, vehicle and equipment manufacturers, \nand financial services. The number of pledging companies has now increased to 35.\nWe were one of the original 28 pioneering companies, and the our pledge reads: “JM is \nputting its science and experience at the heart of solutions that support a cost-effective \ntransition to a secure and environmentally sustainable energy system. By 2030, Johnson \nMatthey pledges to invest c. £1billion in the research, development and deployment of clean \nhydrogen technologies.”\nAs part of the Pledge, JM committed to provide an update annually, and we can report that \nour planned investment in this area is well on track to meet the Pledge. These investments \ninclude research, development and deployment of processes and catalysts underpinning the \nproduction of CCS-enabled (blue) hydrogen, components for the production of renewable \nelectrolytic (green) hydrogen, components for hydrogen fuel cell technologies and the \noptimisation of refining technologies to recycle platinum group metals from these and other \nhydrogen-related applications.\nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 202344\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTSOTHER INFORMATION\nSustainability continued\nTask Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures\nIn this section\nIntroduction 45\nGovernance 45\nStrategy 46\nRisk management 51\nMetrics and targets 52\nIntroduction\nClimate change is one of the most pressing threats facing our planet today. It is affecting our \nenvironment and poses a growing risk for people and businesses alike. We recognise that \nwhat we do at Johnson Matthey has impacts – both positive and negative. Our products and \nservices help our customers to reduce greenhouse emissions and the new technologies \nwe are designing will help further accelerate the transition to a low-carbon future. But the \nmanufacturing and chemical processes we use have their own environmental impact, \ncreating greenhouse gas emissions and using water.\nOur company purpose is catalysing the net zero transition. Therefore, our strategy is shaped \naround the opportunities and the risks that our changing climate presents. We have set \nourselves the target of achieving net zero by 2040 with a series of challenging short-term \nscience-based targets (SBTs) on the 1.5oC pathway as well as an avoided GHG emissions \ntarget for benefits to our customers for 2030 (see page 24 for a full table of targets), to \nensure we keep driving up the benefits of our products while reducing their environmental \nimpact.\nThe disclosures in this report are consistent with the TCFD recommendations.\nGovernance\nGiven the nature of our business, and how closely aligned our strategy is to a warming world, \nclimate-related risks and opportunities have been on the board’s agenda for many years.\nRole of the Board and its committees\nThe Board is responsible for setting and overseeing the implementation of the group’s \nstrategy, including the annual budget and detailed business plans. In doing so, it considers \nclimate-related issues, including when approving requests for capital expenditure or new \ninitiatives.\nAs a result of our internal board effectiveness review, the responsibilities of the Board and its \ncommittees in relation to climate-related issues and the broader sustainability agenda have \nbeen refined and clarified during the year.\nThe Societal Value Committee (SVC) is a meeting of the full Johnson Matthey board that \nfocuses more closely on the governance of sustainability matters, including our response \nto climate change. The SVC meets four times a year, see pages 88-89 for more information \nabout their work in 2022/23. The SVC has been driving the development and validation \nof roadmaps to deliver on our 2030 GHG reduction targets and the integration of carbon \naccounting into the company’s budgeting and capital allocation exercises, to ensure the right \nresources were allocated to deliver on our objectives. Given how fast society’s response to \nclimate change is developing, the SVC receives papers on emerging issues related to climate \nat each meeting, such as legislation and stakeholders’ expectations. During the year the \nCommittee has invited external experts to get an ‘outside-in’ view on climate regulation, \nincluding Inflation Reduction Action in the US and Green Deal in Europe.\nTogether with the Nomination Committee, the Board ensures that, among the directors, \nit has the necessary sustainability and climate-related expertise.\n For more details of our non-executive directors’ skills and experience, see pages 76-77\nThe Audit Committee monitors and assesses the level of assurance over TCFD and climate- \nrelated issues and performance metrics as we continue to develop our reporting in this area. \nThe Audit Committee is also responsible for reviewing the effectiveness of internal control \nand risk management, which includes climate-related risk.\nThe Remuneration Committee set two climate-related targets within the group’s Long-term \nPerformance Share Plan (PSP) in early 2022.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant",
