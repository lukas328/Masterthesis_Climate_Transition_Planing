The Committee \nChair is also available for questions at the AGM. The feedback that the committee receives \nthen informs discussions for the formulation of future policy and subsequent remuneration \ndecisions. The committee is also regularly updated on the collective views of shareholders \nand investor advisory bodies by its independent advisor.\nAs part of the policy renewal process, the Committee Chair consulted with major \nshareholders, as well as proxy voting bodies and shareholder advisory groups. Based \non the feedback from our engagement, shareholders welcomed the proposed changes \nto the remuneration policy and so no amendments were required to the proposed policy. \nApproach to recruitment\nThe recruitment policy provides an appropriate framework within which to attract individuals \nof the required calibre to lead a company of Johnson Matthey’s size, scale and complexity. \nThe Remuneration Committee determines the remuneration package for any appointment \nto an executive director position, either from within or outside Johnson Matthey.\nThe following table sets out the various components which would be considered for inclusion \nin the remuneration package for the appointment of an executive director and the approach \nto be adopted by the Remuneration Committee in respect of each component.\nIn the case of an internal promotion to the board, the company will honour any contractual \ncommitments made prior to the promotion. \nArea Policy and operation\nOverall The policy of the board is to recruit the best candidate possible for any board position and to structure pay and benefits in line with the Remuneration Policy set out in this report. \nThe ongoing structure of a new recruit’s package would be the same as for existing directors, with the possible exception of an identifiable buy-out provision, as set out below.\nBase salary or fees Salary or fees will be determined by the Remuneration Committee in accordance with the principles set out in the policy table on page 107.\nBenefits and \npension\nAn executive director will be eligible for benefits and pension arrangements in line with the company’s policy for current executive directors, as set out in the policy table \non page 107.\nAnnual Incentive \nPlan\nThe maximum level of opportunity is as set out in the policy table on page107. The Remuneration Committee retains discretion to set different performance targets for a new \nexternally appointed executive director, or to adjust performance targets and/or measures in the case of an internal promotion, to be assessed over the remainder of the financial \nyear. In this case any bonus payment would be made at the same time as for existing directors, such award to be pro-rated for the time served in the performance period.\nPerformance \nShare Plan\nThe maximum level of opportunity is as set out in the policy table on page 107. In order to achieve rapid alignment with Johnson Matthey’s and shareholder interests, the \nRemuneration Committee retains discretion to grant a PSP award to a new externally appointed executive director on or soon after appointment if they join outside of the \nnormal grant period.\nReplacement \nawards buy-out\nThe Remuneration Committee retains discretion to grant replacement buy-out awards (in cash or shares) to a new externally appointed executive director to reflect the loss \nof awards granted by a previous employer. Where this is the case, the Remuneration Committee will seek to structure the replacement award such that overall it is on an \nequivalent basis to broadly replicate that foregone, using appropriate performance terms. If granted, any replacement buy-out award would not exceed the maximum set out \nin\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
