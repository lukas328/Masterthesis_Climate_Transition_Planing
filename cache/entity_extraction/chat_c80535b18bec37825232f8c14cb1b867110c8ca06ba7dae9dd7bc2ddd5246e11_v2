Key \nareas of focus of the 2023 assurance plan include: \nkey components of the Group’s strategic framework \nand transformation plans, information technology \nand data, risk management and control (including \nimplementation of the IMS), workforce management, \nlegal and regulatory compliance, clinical governance, \nand sustainability. \nFurther details of the activities of the Audit Committee in \nrelation to GIA are set out in the Audit Committee report \non page 71. \nIntegrated reporting \nAn integrated report, which provides an overview and \nassessment of the Group’s systems of risk management \nand internal control in 2022, combining inputs from \neach of Bupa’s three lines, was presented to a joint \nmeeting of the Audit and Risk Committees in February \n2023. The report enables the Board and its Committees \nto assess the Group’s systems of risk management and \ncontrol in a comprehensive and consistent way, and to \nconsider relative strengths, weaknesses and future \nimprovement opportunities. The report also provides \nthe basis on which the Board reports on Bupa’s \ncompliance with associated aspects of the Code. \nWhistleblowing \nWe foster an open and honest culture which includes \nencouraging and enabling our people and third parties \nto raise concerns of any malpractice or wrongdoing at \nBupa in a secure and anonymous way in cases where \nreporting directly to a manager is not appropriate or \nthe concern has not been fully addressed. We run \nregular internal campaigns to raise awareness of Speak \nUp, Bupa’s internal whistleblowing process, and provide \nfeedback on the actions taken in response to concerns \nraised. All employees complete mandatory annual \ntraining and there are Speak Up officers for each \nbusiness. We use our engagement survey to test the \nlevel of confidence our people have in Speak Up, and \ninvite feedback. The Audit Committee annually reviews \nthe Speak Up policy to ensure that it is robust and \noperating effectively and recommends it to the Board \nfor approval. The Board receives regular updates on \nissues reported through Speak Up during the year and \non investigations and actions taken. \nBupa Annual Report 2022 64 \n  \n     \n         \n       \n      \n        \n       \n      \n   \n        \n          \n        \n        \n       \n          \n         \n       \n         \n       \n         \n      \n      \n        \n       \n        \n          \n        \n        \n     \n       \n         \n        \n       \n        \n      \n         \n     \n        \n        \n           \n    \n     \n   \n       \n         \n        \n        \n        \n         \n    \n       \n          \n        \n        \n        \n           \n            \n       \n         \n \n    \n        \n \n       \n         \n        \n    \n       \n      \n         \n       \n    \n       \n      \n       \n        \n         \n         \n         \n \n \n  \n      \n     \n        \n           \n     \n          \n     \n      \n         \n     \n       \n    \n          \n    \n   \nStrategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements \nBupa’s system of governance continued \nExternal Auditor \nExternal audit provides independent assurance \nto the Company concerning the audited financial \ninformation in this Annual Report and Accounts. \nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) is our current \nExternal Auditor. The lead audit partner, Jo Leeson, \nattends all meetings of the Audit Committee and \nRisk Committee and provides regular reports to \nthe Audit Committee. \nPwC has internal procedures and controls in place \nto follow the Ethical Standard issued by the Financial \nReporting Council (FRC) for auditors to ensure that \nit remains independent. There are no contractual \nobligations restricting the Group’s choice of External \nAuditor and there is no limitation of liability in relation \nto statutory audit activities in the terms of PwC’s \nappointment as External Auditor of the Company. \nBupa has an Audit and Non-Audit Services Policy, \nsetting out the circumstances under which the \nGroup’s External Auditor can be engaged for non-audit \nservices, recruitment restrictions for candidates with \nemployment experience with the External Auditor \nand monitoring and reporting requirements for Bupa \nemployees, contractors and temporary staff with close \nfamily members who are employed by the External \nAuditor. The policy is in line with the FRC’s Revised \nEthical Standard 2019 on the integrity, objectivity and \nindependence of external auditors. It sets out certain \npre-approved services, permitted services requiring \napproval and prohibits all other services. Non-audit \nservices are generally capped at 70% of the average \nGroup statutory audit fees paid over the preceding \nthree years. In practice, only pre-approved services \nor permitted services are allowed in exceptional \ncircumstances. Depending on the value, permitted \nservices must be approved in advance by the Group \nPerformance and Finance Transformation Director, \nGroup CFO or Chair of the Audit Committee. \nInformation on the Audit Committee’s interaction with the \nExternal Auditor during the year can be found in the Audit \nCommittee report on page 71. \nComplying with the UK Corporate \nGovernance Code 2018 \nStrong corporate governance practices are critical to \nmanage the business well, enabling the Board to make \ntimely, informed decisions and ensuring the right type, \nquality and volume of information reaches the Board \nand Committees and is communicated by the Board \nto the business. Voluntarily applying the Code helps \nus to achieve this. \nThroughout 2022, we applied the Principles and \ncomplied with all the provisions in the Code, to the \nextent they are applicable to a company without \nshares. This table indicates where stakeholders can \nassess how the Company has applied the principles \nof the Code and where key content can be found \nin this report.
