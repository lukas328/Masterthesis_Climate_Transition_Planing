(part of Sanitas Hospitales and New Services) of £2m (2021: £8m). \nIn December 2021, the Group entered into a £900m revolving credit facility which had an initial maturity of \nDecember 2026 with two, one-year extension options. The facility replaced an £800m revolving credit facility \nand a separate £40m bilateral facility. In November 2022, the facility was extended by the first of the two options \nwith the maturity date for the facility now December 2027. The second optional extension is in November 2023. \nThe facility was drawn down by £70m as at 31 December 2022 (2021: £150m drawn down). Drawings under the \n£900m facility are guaranteed by the Company. The overdraft facilities are subject to cross guarantees within the \nGroup. The bank loans and overdrafts bear interest at commercial rates linked to SONIA for sterling or equivalent \nfor other currencies. \nFair value of financial liabilities \nThe fair value of a financial liability is defined as the amount for which a financial liability could be exchanged in \nan arm’s-length transaction between informed and willing parties. Fair values of subordinated liabilities and senior \nunsecured bonds are calculated based on quoted prices. \nThe fair values of quoted liabilities in active markets are based on current offer prices. The fair values of financial \nliabilities for which there is no active market are established using valuation techniques. These may include \nreference to the current fair value of other instruments that are substantially the same and discounted cash \nflow analysis. \nFinancial liabilities are categorised into a three-level fair value hierarchy as described in Note 9. Where the fair \nvalue of a bond cannot be otherwise determined from quoted market values, the instrument is discounted using \nsimilar duration treasuries and applying an instrument-specific spread. \nAn analysis of borrowings by fair value classification is as follows: \n2022 2021 \nLevel 1 Level 2 Total Level 1 Level 2 Total \n£m £m £m £m £m £m \nSubordinated liabilities 906 – 906 1,104 – 1,104 \nSenior unsecured bonds 545 – 545 608 44 652 \nBank loans and overdrafts 2 106 108 – 196 196 \nTotal fair value 1,453 106 1,559 1,712 240 1,952 \nThe Group does not have any Level 3 financial liabilities. \nBupa Annual Report 2022 172 \n \n   \n               \n            \n \n                 \n                  \n            \n                    \n             \n                  \n                \n                    \n                      \n                \n                   \n  \n                  \n                   \n                \n                 \n                \n                \n                   \n                  \n     \n                 \n                      \n          \n \n \n        \n        \n    \n    \n    \n       \n    \n            \n      \n       \n    \n    \n        \n               \n                 \n               \n \n                  \n                  \n                \n                  \n                  \n          \n      \n   \nStrategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements \nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \ncontinued \nLeases in brief Note 18: \nLeases are contracts that convey the right to use an asset for a period of \nLeases time in exchange for consideration. The majority of the Group’s leases relate \nto properties. \nThe Group’s leases primarily relate to hospitals, care homes, clinics and office buildings. Lease terms are negotiated \non an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions. Property leases often include \nextension and termination options, open market rent reviews, indexation uplifts or fixed uplifts. \nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the \ncommencement date, discounted using the individual lessee company’s incremental borrowing rate taking into \naccount the duration of the lease. The lease liability is subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective \ninterest method, with the finance cost charged to the Consolidated Income Statement over the lease period so \nas to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. It is remeasured when \nthere is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in index or rate, or if the Group changes its \nassessment of whether it will exercise an extension or termination option. The lease liability is recalculated using \na revised discount rate if the lease term changes as a result of a modification or reassessment of an extension \nor termination option. \nThe right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted \nfor any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an \nestimate of costs to restore properties to their original condition, less any lease incentives received. The right-of-\nuse asset, excluding restoration costs, is typically depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease term. In \naddition, the right-of-use asset may be adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability, such as \nindexation and market rent review uplifts. Restoration costs included in the right-of-use asset are amortised over \nthe same term as the corresponding provision, which may be longer than the IFRS 16 contractual lease term where \noccupancy of the property is expected to be longer than the existing contract. The movement of the right-of-use \nasset is disclosed in Note 4. \nThe Group has elected not to recognise the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have \na term of 12 months or less or leases that are of low value (£4,000 or less). Lease payments associated with these \nleases are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term. \n2022 202\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GRUPO BUPA SANITAS S.L.<|><|>ORGANIZATION<|>A healthcare company involved in managing loans and financial activities related to healthcare services in Spain)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ESPECIALIZADA Y PRIMARIA L’HORTA-MANISES S.A.U.<|><|>ORGANIZATION<|>A healthcare organization, part of Sanitas Hospitales and New Services, involved in healthcare provision and financial activities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SANITAS HOSPITALES<|><|>ORGANIZATION<|>A healthcare group specializing in hospital services, part of the Sanitas brand)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW SERVICES<|><|>ORGANIZATION<|>A healthcare service provider, part of the Sanitas group, involved in healthcare operations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DECEMBER 2021<|><|>EVENT<|>The date when the Group entered into a £900m revolving credit facility, marking a significant financial transaction)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DECEMBER 2026<|><|>EVENT<|>Original maturity date of the £900m revolving credit facility entered into in December 2021)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DECEMBER 2027<|><|>EVENT<|>Extended maturity date of the £900m revolving credit facility after the first extension in November 2022)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NOVEMBER 2022<|><|>EVENT<|>Date when the £900m facility was extended by one year, changing its maturity to December 2027)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NOVEMBER 2023<|><|>EVENT<|>Second optional extension date for the £900m facility, planned for November 2023)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>£70m<|><|>ORGANIZATION<|>Amount drawn down from the £900m facility as of 31 December 2022)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>£150m<|><|>ORGANIZATION<|>Amount drawn down from the £900m facility in 2021)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SONIA<|><|>ORGANIZATION<|>A benchmark interest rate linked to the bank loans and overdrafts for sterling currencies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FAIR VALUE<|><|>EVENT<|>The estimated amount for which a financial liability could be exchanged in an arm's-length transaction, used to value liabilities like bonds and subordinated liabilities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUBORDINATED LIABILITIES<|><|>ORGANIZATION<|>Financial liabilities with a fair value of £906m in 2022, representing a type of debt subordinate to other liabilities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SENIOR UNSECURED BONDS<|><|>ORGANIZATION<|>Debt securities with a fair value of £545m in 2022, representing unsecured bonds issued by the Group)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BANK LOANS AND OVERDRAFTS<|><|>ORGANIZATION<|>Short-term borrowings with a fair value of £108m in 2022, including overdraft facilities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEASING<|><|>EVENT<|>Contracts that convey the right to use assets like properties for a period in exchange for consideration, primarily related to hospital, care homes, clinics, and office buildings)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROPERTY LEASES<|><|>ORGANIZATION<|>Leases related to properties used by the Group, including hospitals and clinics, with terms negotiated individually)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RIGHT-OF-USE ASSET<|><|>ORGANIZATION<|>An asset representing the right to use leased properties, initially measured at cost and depreciated over the lease term)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEASE LIABILITY<|><|>ORGANIZATION<|>Liability representing the present value of lease payments, subsequently measured at amortized cost and remeasured upon changes in lease terms or indexation)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GRUPO BUPA SANITAS S.L.<|>SANITAS HOSPITALES<|>Sanitas Hospitales is part of Grupo Bupa Sanitas S.L., involved in healthcare services<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ESPECIALIZADA Y PRIMARIA L’HORTA-MANISES S.A.U.<|>SANITAS HOSPITALES<|>Part of Sanitas Hospitales, involved in healthcare provision<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DECEMBER 2021<|>£900m revolving credit facility<|>The Group entered into this facility on December 2021<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DECEMBER 2026<|>£900m revolving credit facility<|>Original maturity date of the facility<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DECEMBER 2027<|>£900m revolving credit facility<|>Extended maturity date after November 2022 extension<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NOVEMBER 2022<|>£900m revolving credit facility<|>Date when the facility was extended by one year<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NOVEMBER 2023<|>£900m revolving credit facility<|>Planned second extension date<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>£70m<|>£900m facility<|>Amount drawn as of 31 December 2022<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>£150m<|>£900m facility<|>Amount drawn in 2021<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SONIA<|>Bank loans and overdrafts<|>Interest rates linked to SONIA for sterling currencies<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
