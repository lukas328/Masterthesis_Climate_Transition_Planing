Furthermore, the BRF Sustainability Plan \ninvolves 11 commitments related to this issue which are \nconnected to international benchmarks and challenges \nfacing the sector . In 2022, we invested more than R$ 41 \nmillion in animal welfare (BEA), including R$ 8 million in our \nproprietary farms, and R$ 33 million through incentives for \nintegrated producers for structural alterations designed to \nmeet our commitment to collective gestation.\nWe have adopted the concept of the five domains of \nAnimal welfare an evolution of the Five Animal Freedoms \nestablished by the Farm Animal Welfare Committee (FAWC), \nwhich include not only physiological aspects, but also the \nbehavior and mental states of the animals. We have a \nzero-tolerance policy concerning animal mistreatment, with \npublic targets, commitments, team training, protocols and \nongoing improvements in farming and slaughter practices.\nThe governance related to this issue ranges from senior \nmanagement (by means of discussions within the Sustain-\nability Committee that advises the Board of Directors) to \nthe directors involved in the farm and industrial operations. \nConsidered to be a material topic by our stakeholders, as \ndemonstrated in the materiality process performed (read \nmore on page 4), animal welfare at BRF involves audits, \ninspections, checklists, analyses of cases of non-com-\npliance, technical committees, compliance standards, \ntraining and awareness-raising, and actions involving the \nintegrated producers. \nFive Animal Freedoms\n1.

In 2022, the scope of application \nof this tool came to include the poultry and swine repro-\nduction chains. \nBRF’s production chain includes chickens (Brazil and \nTurkey), broiler turkeys  (Brazil and Turkey) and swine \n(Brazil), produced under the supervision and control of \nBRF. The raw materials of animal origin (beef and dairy \nproducts, as well as industrial use eggs) are sourced from \nratified suppliers who have to meet the animal welfare \nrequirements set forth in the CODE OF CONDUCT FOR \nBRF BUSINESS PARTNERS.\nFurthermore, since 2019, BRF’s animal welfare officials \nhave used samples to perform more than 9,000 assess-\nments of integrated producers from the broiler chicken, \nbroiler turkey and swine chains. In 2022, around 2,500 \nintegrated producers (or 26.3% of the properties in our \nchain) were assessed. The units have the autonomy \nto perform monthly self-assessments, whilst they also \nundergo second-party audits performed by a corporate \nteam, some of which also include audits by clients and \ncertifying entities. \nOver the course of the year , 100% of our broiler chicken, \nturkey and swine abattoirs underwent a total of 376 \nassessments in relation to the criteria of receipt and \nslaughter of live animals.
