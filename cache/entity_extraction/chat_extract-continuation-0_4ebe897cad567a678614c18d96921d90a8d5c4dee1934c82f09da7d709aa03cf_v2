By taking the right actions to \ndecarbonise, we can help our customers grow \ntheir investments and protect them against risk.\nIt is our fiduciary duty to always make decisions in \nthe best interest of our customers, and any steps \nwe take to decarbonise need to make sense for \nour customers from a financial perspective.  \nOur analysis shows that, in the long term, failing to \ndecarbonise our portfolio exposes our customers \nto increased stranded asset risk and leads to less \nresilient investment portfolios. We also believe \nthat companies whose business models align  \nwith a net zero transition are more likely to benefit \nfrom the growth opportunities presented by  \na low carbon future.\nWe are developing a robust governance process \nto ensure we manage and monitor climate risk as \na financial risk to improve customer outcomes. \nThis includes assessing customer impact of any \nnew decarbonisation activity and periodically \nreviewing the effects of the existing activities,  \nto ensure there are no unintended consequences \nemerging that could be at a detriment to our \ncustomers’ interests.

Effective stewardship of our assets\nAs a large asset owner, we recognise \nour stewardship responsibilities and \nadopt an ‘engagement first’ approach \nwith the objective of using our \nposition of influence to bring about \ncorporate change. Stewardship is \ntherefore central to our Net Zero \nTransition Plan and one of our most \neffective levers to drive real economy \nemissions reductions. \nThis is why we have committed to becoming \nsignatories to the UK Stewardship Code in 2023. \nWe are also signatories to both the UN-convened \nNet Zero Asset Owners Alliance (‘NZAOA’) and the \nIIGCC and are utilising the protocols developed \nby these organisations to guide our engagement.\nWe have built a stewardship engagement \nframework that is tailored by sector and builds \non the four TCFD pillars of governance and \nremuneration, strategy, risk management and \nmetrics and targets (in addition to which we \nconsider investee companies’ climate disclosures). \nTable 6 summarises our expectations of all investee \ncompanies to manage climate-related risks and \nopportunities and transition to net zero. \nTable 6: Expectations of investee companies for corporate management \nto manage climate-related risks and opportunities.\nWe expect companies to provide robust disclosure and evidence on climate change management \nand action across the following pillars linked to the TCFD framework. Full details can be found in our \nExpectations of Investee Companies, in summary:\nGovernance and \nremuneration\nBoard-level oversight and responsibility for climate related issues and executive \nremuneration linked to achieving climate transition-related KPIs\nStrategy Commitment to a long-term net zero goal by 2050, with a clear scope, timeline and baseline\nDetails on measures that will be deployed to deliver GHG emissions reduction targets \nDefinition of a coal phase-out plan where applicable for the sector\nEvidence of climate scenario analysis to test the alignment of the company transition plan and \nrelevant interim targets with net zero\nDetails on capital allocation and R&D spending in alignment with the transition plan\nRisk \nmanagement\nEvidence of integration of transition and physical risks in the company risk management, \nframework.\nMetrics and \ntargets\nDisclosure of verified Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions\nCommitment to short-, mid- and long-term targets aligned with a 1.5°C trajectory covering \nthe company value chain\nCommitment to apply for SBTi verification or a credible independent verification of the \ncompany’s targets.\nDisclosure Annual, externally audited disclosure in line with TCFD requirements\nDevelopment of a climate transition plan\nAnnual responses to CDP questionnaire\nSplit of engagement activity\nWe undertake direct engagement with  \n25 priority investee companies, which account for \n40% of our financed emissions in material sectors, \nthrough our in-house stewardship team. In addition \nto which we undertake delegated engagement \nwith a larger number of investee companies \nthrough our asset management partners.  \nIn 2022, our asset management partners \nhave engaged on climate change issues with \n464 companies held in our investment strategies, \nrepresenting 29% of financed emissions from \nhigh-emitting sectors in our listed equity and \ncorporate fixed income portfolios (using the \n2019 baseline). Our 2022 direct and delegated \nengagements on climate change have therefore \ncovered 69% of financed emissions bringing \nus into alignment with the AOA Target Setting \nProtocol and IIGCC Net Zero
