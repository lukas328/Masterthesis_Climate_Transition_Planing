Where there are contract features that \ncould indicate the transfer of insurance risk, management has reviewed and considered detailed contract terms \nand analysed supporting profitability data. The Group has concluded that no additional contracts are brought \ninto scope on adoption of IFRS 17. \nIn applying the standard, Bupa has reviewed the Group’s insurance and reinsurance contracts and considered the \ncontract boundary for each type of policy. The majority of policies have a coverage period of one year or less. As a \nresult, the Group has taken the available policy choice to apply the PAA to these contracts. This approach leads to \nsimplified measurement and presentation relative to the GMM. The liability for incurred claims (LFIC) is consistent \nunder the GMM and the PAA and due to the accounting policy choices made by the Group is materially unchanged \nfrom outstanding claims provision under IFRS 4. The LFIC is made up of the best estimate outstanding claims \nprovision, expenses already incurred but not yet paid in relation to claims and the cost of handling incurred \nclaims at the reporting date. \nThe liability for remaining coverage (LFRC) under the PAA is valued at initial recognition based on premium \nreceived, less any directly attributable acquisition costs deferred. In subsequent periods, the LFRC is amortised \nto recognise the revenue and insurance expenses (insurance acquisition cash flows) on a passage of time basis \nover the coverage period. If certain acquisition cash flows paid on new contracts are allocated to future renewals, \noutside the boundary of the current contract, the deferred portion is recognised in the carrying amount of the \nrelated portfolio of the insurance contract issued. Revenue recognition is consistent with IFRS 4; however, the \nbalance sheet presentation differs as deferred acquisition costs relating to contracts already recognised, and \ninsurance receivables are no longer shown as separate assets but are included within the LFRC. \nUnder the PAA, a risk adjustment is recognised on all LFIC balances and LFRC balances for onerous contracts \nissued. The Group has taken the decision to use a confidence level technique to estimate the risk adjustment, \nthis leads to a value that is consistent with the margin of prudence under IFRS 4. \nThe Group has a small number of policy groups with a coverage period of greater than a year. For these groups \nof contracts, the Group has assessed whether the measurement of the LFRC under the PAA is expected to differ \nmaterially from that under the general model. This required the use of a model of the GMM and materiality \nthresholds determined by management for these policies, as well as the selection of reasonably expected scenarios \nagainst which eligibility is assessed. The majority of contracts are eligible for the PAA measurement model either \nautomatically or through assessment, but there are small amounts of business around the Group which are not \neligible and require measurement under the GMM. The Group has a legacy portfolio of individual health contracts in \nBrazil with a contract boundary of greater than one year; these contracts are onerous and a GMM valuation is used \nin the LFRC. \nIFRS 17 defines a portfolio of insurance contracts as ‘Insurance contracts subject to similar risks and managed \ntogether’. As the Group essentially sells one ‘health insurance’ product line, where cash flows are generally \nexpected to respond similarly in direction and timing to changes in assumptions, and the Group manages the \ninsurance business at geographic ‘Business Unit’ level, the Group has defined portfolios as insurance Business \nUnits at a minimum, with further disaggregation if there are other business lines. \nUnder the PAA, a portfolio is the level at which policyholder assets and liabilities are presented in the statement \nof financial position. Further segmentation is required into groups of contracts for the identification of onerous \ncontracts. There is a presumption under the PAA that no contracts are onerous unless there are facts and \ncircumstances that indicate otherwise. However, the requirement to identify onerous contracts means that \nbusiness is generally accounted for at a level lower than portfolios, being profitability groupings. This is the \nbasis on which the standard requires various assessments to be made, e.g. PAA eligibility, and therefore the \ndetermination of the unit of account is a key judgement in applying IFRS 17. \nBupa Annual Report 2022 129 \n              \n                \n                 \n                  \n                   \n              \n    \n                   \n                         \n        \n                  \n                  \n                 \n                    \n                   \n                 \n       \n                     \n                \n                    \n      \n                 \n                \n                 \n                 \n                  \n                     \n                  \n                \n                   \n                  \n        \n                \n     \n   \n              \n                 \n               \n                \n                \n               \n         \n  \n                 \n              \n              \n                \n  \n                  \n               \n                  \n                  \n                 \n   \n                \n                     \n          \n      \n   \nStrategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements \nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \ncontinued \nTo identify potentially onerous contracts, the Group has considered information reviewed by senior management \nin monitoring financial performance.
