In rural \nareas, kerosene or other fossil fuels are used for \nenergy and lighting, polluting the air inside homes. \nThis project has brings reliable solar power and solar \nwater heating systems to customers throughout the \ncountry, while cutting around 55,000 tons of CO2e \na year by replacing the use of kerosene or electricity \nfrom a grid reliant on fossil fuels.\nOrb Energy manufactures, sells, installs \nand services a unique range of high-quality \nsolar energy systems for residential and \ncommercial customers in India. Businesses \ncan operate for longer and more consistently \nwith a solar energy system.

The stoves are sold  \n(along with other ‘eco-products’ such as solar \nlanterns and water filters) through a local \npartner franchise model that helps ensure \neffective financing, marketing, and support  \nto both end customers and local partners. \n251,000 stoves have been sold across all \neight provinces in Kenya.\nCONTENTS\nLSEG CLIMATE TRANSITION PLAN 202229\nWhy?\nUnderstanding the impact of a changing climate on both our physical \nlocations and our business model is fundamental to how we plan and \noperate as a global business.
