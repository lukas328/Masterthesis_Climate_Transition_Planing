This is particularly true for UK cities other than London, where achieving the \nsame level of integrated public transport requires further support. An overall approach is lacking and there is \nsome risk to policies aimed at shifting consumers towards more active travel, with the aim that half of urban \njourneys will be walked or cycled by 2030. Key enabling policies such as the Planning System, Active Travel \nEngland and the Roads Investment Scheme need to better reflect these ambitions, providing guidance to local \nauthorities on taking a place-based approach to decarbonisation.\n • Zero emission vehicles: overall the policies to shift towards achieving the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate \nare considered largely “credible” by the UK CCC, delivering almost 78% of the abatement for land transport \nby 2035 as part of the Net Zero Strategy. The ZEV promotes vehicles that have no emissions at the tailpipe, \nwith clear phase-out targets for cars and vans by 2030. These still seem to be on track, with promising growth \nin sales of ZEV for cars, despite sales of zero emissions vans and heavy goods vehicles lagging. The main \nconcern is to ensure that charging infrastructure, as set out in the Infrastructure Strategy, meets user demand \nand expectation and supports the uptake needed. While the Infrastructure Strategy is clearer for cars, the use \ncase for zero emissions vans and heavy goods vehicles is less clear.\n • Conventional vehicle efficiency: expected to deliver 10% of 2035 abatement for surface transport, but is \nconsidered to be at “significant risk” of failing to achieve such a reduction. Policy is directed to internal \ncombustion engines and hybrid vehicles with an operational lifetime between now and 2030. The UK CCC \nsuggests that getting UK Government policy to incentivise the improvement of efficiency of these vehicles now \nwill ensure a lower footprint through the operational life of the vehicle.\n • Rail efficiency and technology: is expected to provide 1% of 2035 abatement, with “some risk” to \nachievement. The UK Government intends to remove diesel-only trains from the network by 2040, with the \nsystem being net zero by 2050. The TDP sets out Network Rail’s Traction Decarbonisation Network Strategy as \na blueprint for how this will be achieved – but now a more comprehensive delivery plan is needed. \nAviation:\nThe UK Government’s JetZero strategy, to deliver net zero aviation by 2050, focuses on improving system \nefficiency and increasing the availability and use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in the near-term, while new \ntechnology is developed. The JetZero strategy acknowledges that aviation is a key industry in making the UK one \nof the best connected and successful trading nations. The strategy does not plan to intervene to limit sector growth \nbut focuses on improving efficiency, decoupling CO2 emissions growth from air traffic growth. This policy is heavily \ndependent on new technology, particularly related to SAF development.\nThe most significant policies relate to the development of SAF, expected to deliver 64% of 2035 abatement, with \nimproved fuel efficiency of aircraft expected to deliver 34% of 2035 abatement. For SAF, there is consultation to \nmandate 10% SAF by 2030, which is a high-level ambition, with over £180 million committed in UK funding to \ndevelop SAF plants. There needs to be clarity on the type of SAF to be included to ensure lifecycle emissions of SAF \nprovide emissions savings and avoids opportunity costs of growing fuels. With regard to fuel efficiency, there is \n“significant risk” to meet the emission reduction requirement for the Department for Transport’s scenarios, \nrequiring significant R&D and high-level international cooperation.\nShipping:\nThe most significant policies relate to enabling low-carbon fuels for shipping, which would deliver 85% of 2035 \nabatement, however, there is a “significant risk” of failing to deliver. The upcoming Course to Zero strategy and \nrefreshed Clean Maritime Plan need more detail on roles and responsibilities in order to drive investment in \ndecarbonising UK shipping. Globally, there is a need to include a net zero 2050 target within the International \nMaritime Organisation initial GHG strategy, to ensure vessel operators are incentivised to transition to low carbon \nfuels. Positive steps would be to include shipping in the UK ETS. Other important policies centre on improving the \nefficiency of vessels and the electrification of shipping, which could deliver 15% of 2035 abatement, with “some \nrisk” to delivery.\n37NatWest Group plc | 2022 Climate-related Disclosures Report\nGovernance Strategy and Climate transition plan Risk Management and Scenario Analysis Metrics and TargetsIntroduction\nNatWest Group has set out \na clear ambition to be a \nleading bank in the UK \nhelping to address the \nclimate challenge.
