The journey towards a net zero economy requires large-scale \ntransformation, including for those companies held within our \ninvestment portfolio. \nWe are aware that climate data and decarbonisation \ninformation and methodologies are continuously evolving areas, \nand acknowledge there are unknowns which may arise in the future. \nWe are also aware that we do not yet have all of the answers, and \nhave more work to do to continuously evolve our transition plan \ndevelopment and execution over time. As such, we are committed \nto maintaining our focus on areas of development both internally \nand externally, updating our approach as required, and reporting \non progress. Specific areas of focus over the next few years are set \nout in Figure 4, and include: \nData coverage and quality\n> Improve data coverage and quality: We continually seek to \nincrease the coverage and quality of our Scope 3 investment \nbook data. As a data user, we are at the end of the data value \nchain, using data disclosed by investees through reporting \nframeworks, such as the TCFD recommendations and CDP. \nWe continue to work with data providers and our asset \nmanagers to improve both the availability and quality of data.\n> Scope 3, categories 1-14: Beyond our financed emissions, further \ndevelop the coverage of our Scope 3 value chain emissions; in \nparticular, assessing our supply chain emissions and initiatives to \nreduce these.\n> Forward-looking metrics: Continue to consider forward-looking \nmetrics both for internal use and external disclosure.\nDecarbonisation targets1 and pathways\n> Update our WACI target: Set a 2030 decarbonisation target by \nthe end of 2024, in line with the NZAOA Protocol requirements, as \nwell as continuing to map out our longer-term decarbonisation \ntrajectory in line with our 2050 net zero commitment. \n> Expand asset classes and sectoral pathways: Expand our \nmonitoring to further asset classes (such as sovereign bonds) as \nmethodologies develop, and continue to develop sector-specific \ndecarbonisation pathways.\n> Explore operational targets: Further investigate the feasibility \nof setting net zero operational targets, taking into account current \nchallenges and the constraints of renewable energy availability \nwithin our markets.\n> Consider emerging topics: Develop a view on how \nemerging topics, such as nature and biodiversity, may impact \nour decarbonisation strategy and our overall approach to \nclimate change.\nClimate-related opportunities\n> Climate financing within emerging markets: Explore innovative \nopportunities to finance the transition in a just and inclusive \nmanner. In particular, we are focused on opportunities to create \nreal-world impact within emerging markets, such as blended \nfinance and financing mechanisms to accelerate the move away \nfrom fossil fuels (eg coal retirement). \n> Internal carbon price: Investigate how we use carbon pricing \nconsistently internally. After developing an initial internal view on \ncarbon pricing, we will seek to further develop and agree on the \nmethodology for setting an internal carbon price, by socialising \nand educating our internal stakeholders on what an internal \ncarbon price is and how Prudential could use it in a consistent \nmanner for operations and investments.\n> Additional internal and external opportunities: In line with  \nour broader climate and TCFD strategy, continue to explore and \nexecute upon relevant climate-related opportunities, such as those \nrelating to our customers and digital services, climate-related \nhealth products and services, and employee initiatives.\nEngagement\n> Further evolve our engagement approach: Further develop  \nan engagement approach covering corporate engagement and \nasset manager engagement, to focus on appropriate sector-\nspecific and emerging market engagement approaches to \nmaximise our real-world impact. This includes working closely  \nwith our asset managers to adopt our approach towards \nresponsible investment within emerging markets.\n> Localised responsible investment approaches: Continue  \nto develop localised, market-specific responsible investment \napproaches to help to address specific local challenges and \nopportunities. These approaches will supplement the Group \nResponsible Investment policy.\nPolicy and advocacy\n> Collaboration opportunities: Further explore opportunities to \ncollaborate and partner with both private and public entities on \nadaptation and transition financing, similar to our involvement  \nin the Vietnam JETP Working Group. \n> Policy engagement: Continue to engage with other financial \nmarket participants, local regulators and standard setters to \nfurther the development of localised frameworks that support \nresponsible investment in emerging markets. \n> Advocacy opportunities: Advocate for climate transition within \nemerging markets and other opportunities at COP and similar \nclimate events during 2023 and beyond. \n1  See the methodologies section\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
