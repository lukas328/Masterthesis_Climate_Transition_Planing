We have applied our heatmap framework to our corporate \nand public sector portfolios and Citi’s own facilities. Additionally, through client assessments and scenario-\nanalysis exercises, we continue to identify additional areas of the portfolio that may be more vulnerable to \nclimate risks (physical and transition). \nThis year , in addition to our sectoral heat map, we expanded our climate risk heatmap to cover our largest \ncountry exposures for internal use. For transition risk, we reviewed countries’ emissions per capita and \nreliance on fossil fuel industries. For physical risk, we assessed countries’ exposure to acute and chronic \nweather events. Potential mitigants (such as level of human development, government commitments and \ngovernment fiscal space) were also used to weigh the individual climate risk factors. Assessments such as \nthese are integral to Citi’s continued climate risk identification efforts.\nClimate Risk Assessments    \nTo help Citi understand the climate risk profiles of our individual corporate clients, we have created a tool \ncalled the Climate Risk Assessment & Scorecard (CRAS).
