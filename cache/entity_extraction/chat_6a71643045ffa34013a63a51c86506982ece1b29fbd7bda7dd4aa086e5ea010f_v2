We have utilized the SSP Methodology to aid the scope, \nboundaries and target setting of this sector within our Net Zero Plan. \nFor the steel production industry, the SSP Methodology focuses on the calculation of emissions intensity \nper ton of steel produced within a fixed system boundary. It bifurcates the production of steel into two \ncategories, each with their own unique emissions reduction pathway — ore-based (mined) and scrap-based \n(recycled). We have set a single emissions intensity target for the steel sector that accommodates the \ndifferentiated decarbonization pathways for primary and secondary steel producers. \nThe SSP Methodology covers Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions and some upstream, indirect Scope \n3 GHG emissions from purchased products (such as emissions from purchased pellets) as well as the \nprocessing of sold products (such as emissions from steel rolling mills). Citi has aligned with this boundary \nfor our absolute financed emissions reporting. Through this fixed boundary system approach and inclusion \nof some upstream Scope 3 emissions, the most carbon-intensive aspect of the iron value chain (use of \nproduct) is also captured under the SSP approach. Due to data availability, we are including — where more \ngranular data is not available — all Scope 3 GHG emissions categories to calculate our absolute financed \nemissions.4 We used S&P Global Trucost and CDP data for these calculations. Our initial data quality for this \nsector scored 2.1 (of 5) on PCAF’s scale.\nWe aligned with the SSP Methodology’s steel production North American Industry Classification System \n(NAICS) codes to identify which companies to include in our baseline assessment. We have calculated our \nabsolute financed emissions for PCAF reporting using outstanding funds, as well as committed funds to \nalign with our NZBA target boundary.\nWe intend to use CRU, the SSP’s partner data provider , to calculate the steel portfolio Climate Alignment \nScore. Per the SSP climate alignment methodology, which measures annual alignment with the scenario, \nCiti will set a target to have a Climate Alignment Score of 0 in 2030. This equates to aligning with IEA NZE \n2050 scenario, but at a more granular level (ensuring the portfolio is NZE-aligned for the primary and \nsecondary steel production). As the Climate Alignment Score measures annual alignment to the scenario, \nyear-on-year portfolio decarbonization is required to continue meeting the score. Given timing constraints \non data delivery, we were unable to calculate Citi’s Climate Alignment Score for year-end 2021 in time for \npublication. We plan to report this metric in a future disclosure.\n4 See GHG Protocol, Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions at 8-10 (2013). \n22 | TCFD REPORT 2022: CITI’S APPROACH TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND NET ZERO\nSustainable STEEL Principles Methodology  \nThe Sustainable STEEL Principles (SSP) are a turn-key solution for measuring and disclosing the \n1.5°C alignment of steel lending portfolios. Designed to support the practical achievement of net  \nzero emissions in the steel industry, they also provide the tools necessary for client engagement  \nand advocacy.\nThe SSP is focused on reporting the emissions intensity of steel produced at the product level from \na specific asset/individual sites. Emissions need to be reported in accordance with a defined fixed \nsystem boundary, irrespective of corporate ownership or control. The fraction of ore and scrap inputs \nused to produce steel should also be disclosed. The SSP provides steelmakers with a consistent \nmethod for reporting emissions from ore- and scrap-based metallic inputs and steel product and for \nusing emissions data calculated from measured energy for specific processes within the supply chain.\nThe output of the SSP methodology is a portfolio level Climate Alignment Score, which indicates \nalignment to the IEA NZE scenario and the MPP Technology Moratorium scenario.\n         \nALIGNMENT ZONE FOR A  \nSAMPLE STEEL MAKER5\n The SSP were based on the model of the Poseidon Principles — a framework focused on the shipping \nsector . Launched in 2019, the Poseidon Principles are now a global climate standard, with signatory \nbanks representing approximately 65% of the global shipping finance portfolio.\nAs a member of the working group, Citi worked closely with RMI and corporations in the steel \nindustry in the design and development of the SSP. RMI has now launched similar consortiums for \nthe Aviation and Aluminum sectors, which Citi is also participating in to help develop climate-aligned \nfinance approaches for each of these hard-to-abate sectors.\n5 Source: RMI Alignment Zone Briefing: https://climatealignment.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/alignment_zone_briefing.pdf, page 4.  \n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\n1.2\n1.4\n1.6\n1.8\n2.0\n2.2\n2020 2025\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
