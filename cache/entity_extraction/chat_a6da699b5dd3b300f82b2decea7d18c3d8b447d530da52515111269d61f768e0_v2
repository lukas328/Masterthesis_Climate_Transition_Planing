We must pool the collective strength of the Mizuho group and increase the added value of our solutions to these \nchallenges. \n In order to decarbonize the entire portfolio, it is important to support not only the efforts of large corporate clients, but also \nthose of middle market firms and small- and medium-sized enterprises. \n We must carefully consider the impact of engagement, and effective measures must be taken. \n Regarding transition finance, it is important to both verify transition plans at the time of executing a new transaction and to \ncontinue to confirm the progress on the plans afterward. Furthermore, the definition of “transition” should take into account \nstricter points of view, not only from Japan, but also from Europe and other regions. \n Regarding Japan’s efforts to address climate change risk, and taking into account global standards, it is essential to engage \nnot only with corporate clients but also with governmental agencies and other stakeholders. \n It is important for us to acquire experts in the field of sustainability as well as train current employees in these matters. \n Regarding initiatives that are underway, it is important to conduct full disclosures while making improvements, and ensure \nunderstanding among our executives and employees about the status of said initiatives. \n \n \n(2) Involvement of external experts \nAs mentioned above, the Risk Committee and the Sustainability Promotion Committee consult with external experts.
