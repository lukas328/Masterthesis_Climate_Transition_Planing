With \nc.£260 billion assets under administration (AUA), \nwe can play a meaningful role in accelerating the \nbroader economy-wide transition to net zero.\nBy decarbonising our portfolio at the right pace, \nwe can reduce our exposure to companies with \nsignificant climate risk whose business models \nmay become obsolete as the world decarbonises. \nWe can increase our holdings in companies that \nare investing in the net zero transition and aligning \ntheir business models with low-carbon growth. \nAnd we can invest directly in low-carbon solutions, \nfrom wind farms to energy-efficient housing, \nwhich offer long-term, stable, reliable returns. \nOur position as a ‘universal owner’ with diversified \ninvestments across asset classes, sectors and \ngeographies with long time horizons provides \nexposure to the entire economy. This enables \nactive engagement, through coalitions or directly \nwith investee companies with a particular focus on \nthe transition of high-emitting companies to low- \ncarbon business models. \nWhile responsibility for accelerating the transition \nrightly rests with us and other investors, we need \ngovernment and regulators to act too. In many \nareas, such as offshore wind and solar PV, there  \nis a proven investment case and a strong pipeline  \nof investable projects. But in other areas – such  \nas energy efficiency, hydrogen and carbon \ncapture and storage (‘CCS’) – the pipeline of \ninvestable projects is still not strong enough, \nlargely because investable business models  \nhave not been established. \nWe support additional measures from \ngovernments to focus market incentives on \naccelerating investment in net zero-aligned \ninfrastructure as part of a pro-growth, pro-business \ntransition, as outlined in Mission Zero, Independent \nReview of Net Zero by the Rt Hon Chris Skidmore \nMP. If governments and regulators act quickly to \nput those business models in place – and ensure \nthat regulations such as Solvency II are designed  \nto unlock investment – we can turbocharge the  \nnet zero transition in a way that delivers maximum \nbenefit to the economy and our customers.\nThe overwhelming scientific and economic \nconsensus is that we need to limit global warming \nto 1.5° C and early action will significantly reduce \nthe disruption. The speed at which decarbonisation \nhappens will be determined by a range of factors \nincluding government policy, development \nand deployment of technology for net zero \ninfrastructure and consumer behaviour.
