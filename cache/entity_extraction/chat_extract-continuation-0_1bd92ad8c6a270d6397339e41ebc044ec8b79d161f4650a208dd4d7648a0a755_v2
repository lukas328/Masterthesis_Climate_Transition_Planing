Net cash used in financing activities \nis also stable, decreasing by £89m to £459m, with \nGroup reducing debt balances in the period by £173m. \nFunding \nWe manage our funding prudently to ensure a strong \nplatform for continued growth. Bupa’s policy is to \nmaintain investment grade access to both the senior \nand subordinated bond markets. Fitch and Moody’s \nreviewed Bupa’s credit ratings during 2022 with \nMoody’s changing the outlook for Bupa’s ratings to \nstable from negative. Fitch held Bupa's ratings and \noutlook steady during the year. \nWe continue to hold a good level of Group liquidity. \nAt 31 December 2022, our £900m Revolving Credit \nFacility was drawn by £70m (2021: £150m). Coverage \nof financial covenants within the facility remains strong. \nWe focus on managing our leverage in line with our \ncredit rating objectives. Leverage excluding IFRS 16 \nleases at 31 December 2022 was 18.6% (FY 2021: 19.6%) \nand was 26.3% (FY 2022: 26.9%) when IFRS 16 lease \nliabilities are included. \nNote on Chile \nAs referenced at the Half Year 2022, the Isapre \ninsurance industry in Chile has been negatively \nimpacted by judicial and regulatory action. Isapres \nare part of Chile's social security system and provide \naccess to health insurance for individuals, among other \nthings. Pricing for Isapre contracts is determined by \nreference to a base price, a risk factor table (which \nadjusts for age) and a “GES” price (a flat rate covering \na list of diseases). \nThe Chilean Supreme Court has significantly shifted \nits interpretation to Isapre pricing in recent years, \nwith the cumulative effect of restricting the previously \npermitted, and generally accepted, pricing/rate-setting \napproach. In December 2022, the Supreme Court issued \na ruling which requires Isapres to use a statutory risk \nfactor table with retrospective effect – meaning product \ncoverage is not matched by the ability to increase rates \nto reflect the cost of such coverage. This ruling is \ncomplex and uncertain, and the relevant regulator \nhas until May 2023 to implement it. \nBupa Annual Report 2022 11 \n        \n         \n         \n       \n        \n        \n         \n        \n     \n        \n        \n         \n       \n      \n       \n      \n        \n          \n         \n        \n       \n         \n         \n       \n      \n         \n        \n        \n \n          \n      \n  \n         \n \n \n \n  \n \n    \n    \n      \n     \n      \n     \n  \n    \n    \n    \n         \n          \n  \n        \n         \n       \n           \n    \n  \n         \n           \n        \n          \n        \n       \n          \n         \n      \n          \n       \n        \n           \n          \n           \n      \n          \n  \n   \nStrategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements \nFinancial review continued \nSolvency \nOur solvency coverage ratio of 181%1 remains strong \nand is above our target working range of 140-170%. \nThe Group holds capital to cover its Solvency Capital \nRequirement (SCR), calculated on a Standard Formula \nbasis, considering all our risks, including those related \nto non-insurance businesses.
