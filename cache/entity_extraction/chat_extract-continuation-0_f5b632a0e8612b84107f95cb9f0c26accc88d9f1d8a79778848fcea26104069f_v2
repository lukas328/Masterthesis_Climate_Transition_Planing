These award levels are in line with our remuneration policy.\nThe long-term Performance Share Plan will be based on EPS growth targets (30% of the award), relative TSR performance (40% of the award) and specific and measurable strategic \nobjectives (30% of award). \nThe range of annualised EPS growth targets that the committee intends to set for the 2023/24 awards is 1% per annum growth for threshold (15%) vesting, rising to 7% per annum growth for \nmaximum vesting (100%). Vesting will be on a straight-line basis between 1% and 7%. The committee considered the effect of metal price volatility on potential outcomes and, as a result, earnings \nwill be assessed 50% against actual metal prices and 50% against constant metal prices. The committee believes that this will allow for a more accurate assessment of underlying business performance.\nThe TSR target will be 25% vesting for median performance, increasing on a straight-line basis to 100% vesting for upper quartile performance. The TSR peer group will be the FTSE 31 \n– 100 (excluding financial services companies). The committee considers that this comparator group remains the most appropriate given our current market capitalisation.\nThe strategic objectives scorecard will consist of four equally weighted metrics. Threshold vesting will be 25%, increasing on a straight-line basis to 100% at maximum. The four metrics \nare as follows:\n• Products and services – tonnes of GHG avoided during the period using technologies enabled by our products and solutions, compared to conventional solutions, where threshold vesting \nwill be 8.0 million tonnes GHG avoided and maximum will be 12.0 million tonnes GHG avoided.\n• Operations – reduction in Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions (from the 2020 baseline), where threshold vesting will be achieved for a 20% reduction in GHG emissions and maximum vesting \nfor a 25% reduction in GHG emissions.\n• People – percentage of female representation across our management levels, where threshold vesting will be achieved at 32% female representation at management levels and \nmaximum at 33% female representation at management levels.\n• Business transformation – establish global business services and deliver a reduction in associated employment costs (from the 2022 baseline). The performance range is commercially \nsensitive and will be disclosed at such a time when it is no longer considered commercially sensitive. \nAwards vest in year three and are then subject to a two-year holding period.\nChairman and \nnon-executive \ndirector fees\nThe fees for the Chair and non-executive directors were reviewed during the year and increased in line with the increase awarded to executive directors.\nThis Remuneration Report was approved by the Board of Directors on 25th May 2023 and signed on its behalf by:\nChris Mottershead\nChair of the Remuneration Committee\nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 2023 127\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTSOTHER INFORMATION\nAnnual report on remuneration continued\nDirectors’ report\nStatutory and other information\nThe Directors’ report required under the Companies Act 2006 (2006 Act) comprises the Governance report (pages 73 to127), including the Sustainability report for our disclosure of carbon \nemissions, which is included in the Strategic report (pages 20 to 44).

Neither Johnson Matthey Plc or any subsidiary has indemnified any director of the Company or a subsidiary in respect of any liability that they may incur \nto a third party in relation to a relevant occupational pension scheme. The Company maintains appropriate directors’ and officers’ liability insurance.\nConflicts of interest The Board has a policy for identifying and managing directors’ conflicts of interest, which extends to cover close family members. The Board annually reviews external appointments \nto consider any potential or actual conflict of interest. If a conflict of interest is declared, the Board will review the authorisation and terms associated, to ensure that all matters \npresented to the Board are considered solely with a view to promoting JM’s business success. For the year under review, there were no potential or actual conflicts of interest.\nExternal appointments The Board approves all external appointments in advance of acceptance.

In approving each additional external appointment, the Board assesses time commitment to ensure that no directors are \nconsidered over boarded.\nIndex of disclosures referred to elsewhere in the report\nBusiness model 8-9 Employee engagement 35,  80\nDividends 193 Diversity and employment of disabled persons 36\nResults 55-61, 144 Greenhouse gas emissions 28\nResearch and development activities 14-21, 60 Human rights and anti-bribery and corruption 38-39\nFuture developments 14-21 Modern slavery and human trafficking statement 39 /matthey.com\nNon-financial key performance\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>JOHNSON MATTHEY<|><organization<|>Johnson Matthey is a global specialty chemicals and sustainable technologies company, involved in areas such as emissions control, catalysts, and sustainable solutions, with a focus on innovation and environmental responsibility)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHRIS MOTTERSHEAD<|><person<|>Chris Mottershead is the Chair of the Remuneration Committee at Johnson Matthey, responsible for overseeing executive compensation and governance matters)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FTSE 31-100<|><organization<|>The FTSE 31-100 is a peer group index comprising the 31st to 100th largest companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, used as a benchmark for performance comparison)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN<|><event<|>The Long-term Performance Share Plan is an incentive scheme based on metrics such as EPS growth, TSR performance, and strategic objectives, designed to align executive rewards with company performance)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EPS<|><event<|>Earnings Per Share (EPS) growth targets are set as part of the Performance Share Plan, with specific annual growth thresholds for vesting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TSR<|><event<|>Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance targets are used in the incentive plan, with vesting levels based on median to upper quartile performance relative to the peer group)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES<|><event<|>The strategic objectives scorecard includes metrics such as GHG emissions reduction, female management representation, product and service impact, and business transformation, used to assess performance for incentive vesting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Johnson Matthey Plc<|><organization<|>Johnson Matthey Plc is a publicly traded company specializing in sustainable technologies, emissions control, and catalysts, with a focus on environmental impact and innovation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>2023/24<|><event<|>The fiscal year 2023/24 is the period during which the company intends to set EPS growth targets for the incentive plan)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Metal Price Volatility<|><event<|>Metal price volatility is considered by the committee when assessing earnings, affecting the performance evaluation based on actual and constant metal prices)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Chairman<|><person<|>The Chairman of Johnson Matthey, responsible for leading the Board and overseeing governance and strategic direction)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Remuneration Committee<|><organization<|>The Remuneration Committee at Johnson Matthey oversees executive compensation, including the review and approval of incentive plans and director fees)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Johnson Matthey's Board of Directors<|><organization<|>The governing body responsible for corporate governance, strategic oversight, and approval of remuneration policies, including the 25th May 2023 approval date)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHRIS MOTTERSHEAD<|>JOHNSON MATTHEY<|>Chris Mottershead is the Chair of the Remuneration Committee at Johnson Matthey<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN<|>JOHNSON MATTHEY<|>The Performance Share Plan is a key incentive scheme aligned with company performance metrics<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FTSE 31-100<|>JOHNSON MATTHEY<|>Johnson Matthey compares its TSR performance against the FTSE 31-100 peer group<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Metal Price Volatility<|>JOHNSON MATTHEY<|>The committee considers metal price volatility when assessing earnings and performance outcomes<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Chairman<|>JOHNSON MATTHEY<|>The Chairman leads the Board and oversees governance and strategic decisions<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Johnson Matthey's Board of Directors<|>JOHNSON MATTHEY<|>The Board approves remuneration policies and oversees company governance<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
