Analysis by the ABI suggests \nthat £2.7 trillion needs to be invested in climate \nsolutions by 2035 and a further £3.0 trillion \nbetween 2035 and 2050. A breakdown of \ninvestment requirements by sector is shown \nin figure 24, of which around £0.9 trillion \n(£60 billion per year) of the investment required \nto 2035 could come from ABI members. \nHowever, current deployment rates are \nsignificantly lower, due to a range of policy, \nregulatory and market barriers.\nWe have reviewed 25 technology areas where \nsignificant investment is needed, to prioritise \npotential thought leadership focus areas and \nidentify key barriers currently holding back \ninvestment. This review has identified residential \nheat pumps as being highly cost-competitive \n(by 2030 versus high carbon alternatives), \ntechnologically mature and with a large \naddressable investment pool.\nThe market barriers currently holding back \ninvestment vary by technology, but broadly \nspeaking encompass high up-front capital costs, \nlow technology maturity and insufficient long-term \npolicy signals, which hinder businesses and \ninvestors’ ability to make large, long-term  \nstrategic commitments.\nThe review has helped us to shape our thought \nleadership programme and identify initial focus \nareas for 2023. Our goal is to deliver impactful \nthought leadership each year that makes a \nmeaningful contribution to unlocking barriers and \nhelping us and others achieve our net zero targets. \nAs part of this, we will look for opportunities to \nconvene and collaborate with our peers and other \nrelevant stakeholders such as governement, who \ncould introduce supportive policy frameworks.\nFigure 24: ABI analysis on total gross investment required by sector  \nto meet the UK’s net zero targets\n2036–20502021–2035\n0.4\n0.3\n1.1\n0.8\n2.7\n0.6\n0.3\n1.3\n0.5\n0.1\n3.0\n Electricity supply\n M&C\n Transport\n Removals\n Building\n Fuel supply\n Aviation & Shipping\n Agriculture & Land\n Waste & F-gases\n2\n49\nPhoenix Group Holdings plc Net Zero Transition Plan\nInvest Engage Lead\nEmbedding net zero \nin our business\nBecoming a \nnet zero business Measuring our progress\nExecutive \nsummary\nDriving wider system change continued \nEngaging decision-makers\nWe are committed to working \nconstructively with government to \nhelp shape and deliver its Net Zero \nStrategy and make the UK the first \nnet zero-aligned financial centre.\nAs the UK’s largest long-term savings and \nretirement business, with assets spanning the entire \neconomy, we cannot achieve net zero in a vacuum \nand are particularly dependent on supportive \ngovernment policy. \nWe and our peers have called on government to \nset out a clear delivery plan for the transition of the \nreal economy and financial services, with credible \nsectoral roadmaps underpinned by the near-term \npolicies, actions and milestones needed to shift \nfinancial flows towards net zero.\nWe undertake wide-ranging engagement at both \nofficial and ministerial level, spanning multiple \ndepartments including the Treasury, the \nDepartment for Energy Security and Net Zero \n(‘DESNZ’) and the Department for Environment, \nFood and Rural Affairs (‘DEFRA’), as well as the \ndevolved administrations, opposition parties and \nlocal and combined authorities. \nMuch of our recent and planned government \nengagement focuses on addressing regulatory \nand policy barriers to investment. On regulatory \nchallenges, we are working on Solvency II reform, \nas well as assessing new changes to the charge cap \nand illiquid disclosures on default workplace \npensions, with a view to increasing allocation to \nsustainable investments, which we believe presents \nan opportunity for good customer returns. \nWork on Solvency II reform continues with both \nHMT and the PRA towards implementation in \n2023. It is our desire to see more flexibility \nintroduced into the regulations to help meet our \nnet zero ambitions. These proposed regulatory \nreforms are an important component of the \nchanges needed to the wider UK investment \nlandscape, and will enable us to meet our ambition \nto invest more into sustainable assets in the future.\nWe are also working with the Office for Investment \non funding structures for institutional investors, \nwhich can facilitate investment into alternative  \nand sustainable assets, as well as making \nrepresentations on what local and combined \nauthorities can do to bring forward investable \nopportunities to the market. \nWhile our engagement focus is primarily on  \nUK decision-makers, we do also engage with \ninternational decision-makers and have played \nactive roles at recent COPs. At COP26, we were  \na strategic partner of the Green Horizon Summit, \nwhich brought together over 200 senior speakers \nfrom across the globe to discuss how we can \nmobilise private capital towards a climate-resilient, \nnature-positive economy. At COP27, we sponsored \nthe World Climate Summit at the 2022 United \nNations Climate Change Conference and  \nhelped to push the conversation forward on  \nhow institutional investors could best support  \nthe transition to net zero.\n“We know that we cannot \ndeliver net zero alone and \nare committed to engaging \nconstructively with \ngovernment and regulators \nto help drive the wider \nsystem change needed \nto unlock exciting \nopportunities to significantly \nscale up investment in the \nnet zero transition.”\n \nJames Wilde, Chief Sustainability Officer\n2\n50\nPhoenix Group\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ABI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The ABI (Association of British Insurers) is a trade association representing the insurance and investment industry in the UK, focusing on promoting investment in climate solutions and overcoming barriers to sustainable investments.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Phoenix Group Holdings plc<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Phoenix Group Holdings plc is a major UK-based long-term savings and retirement business committed to embedding net zero strategies and engaging with government to shape policies supporting sustainable investments.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Department for Energy Security and Net Zero<|>GEO<|>A UK government department responsible for energy policy and net zero strategies, engaging with financial institutions to promote climate-related investments.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs<|>GEO<|>A UK government department involved in environmental policies, working with stakeholders to address regulatory barriers to climate investments.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>HMT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Her Majesty's Treasury (HMT) is the UK government department responsible for economic and financial matters, working on reforms like Solvency II to facilitate sustainable investments.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) is a UK financial regulatory body working with HMT on regulatory reforms to support net zero investment goals.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Office for Investment<|>GEO<|>UK government office that collaborates with institutional investors to develop funding structures for sustainable assets.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>COP26<|>EVENT<|>The 26th UN Climate Change Conference held in 2021, where Phoenix Group participated as a strategic partner to promote private capital mobilization for climate resilience.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>COP27<|>EVENT<|>The 27th UN Climate Change Conference held in 2022, where Phoenix Group sponsored the World Climate Summit to advance discussions on institutional investment in climate transition.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>James Wilde<|>PERSON<|>Chief Sustainability Officer at Phoenix Group, leading efforts to engage with government and regulators to promote systemic change for net zero investments.)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ABI<|>Phoenix Group<|>ABI provides analysis and thought leadership that informs Phoenix Group's strategies on climate investments and policy engagement<|>7)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Phoenix Group<|>Department for Energy Security and Net Zero<|>Phoenix Group engages with this department to influence and align on policies supporting sustainable investments<|>6)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Phoenix Group<|>Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs<|>Phoenix Group collaborates with DEFRA to address policy barriers and promote climate solutions<|>6)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Phoenix Group<|>HMT<|>Phoenix Group works with HMT on regulatory reforms like Solvency II to enable more sustainable investments<|>7)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Phoenix Group<|>PRA<|>Phoenix Group collaborates with PRA on regulatory reforms to support net zero investment strategies<|>6)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Phoenix Group<|>Office for Investment<|>Phoenix Group engages with this office to develop funding structures for sustainable assets<|>5)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Phoenix Group<|>COP26<|>Phoenix Group participated as a strategic partner to promote private climate finance at COP26<|>4)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Phoenix Group<|>COP27<|>Phoenix Group sponsored the World Climate Summit to support climate transition investments<|>4)##\n(\"relationship\"<|>James Wilde<|>Phoenix Group<|>James Wilde leads engagement efforts with government and regulators to promote systemic change for net zero<|>6)##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
