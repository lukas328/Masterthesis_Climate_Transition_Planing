As of June 30, 2021, we had over 380 offices \nand operations in more than 80 countries, and a global \nworkforce of more than 92,000 people. \nWe provide services for a broad range of clients who represent a \nwide variety of industries and are based in markets throughout \nthe world.

The Net-Zero Standard \nincludes target validation criteria as well as user-friendly \nguidance for setting net-zero targets. \nDuring this consultation, we applied the methodology of the \nnew Net-Zero Standard, and I am proud the SBTi has certified \nour commitment to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions \nacross our value chain by 2040.\nBy committing to cut 95% of our carbon footprint by 2040, we \nare going beyond the requirement of climate science, which \ndemands a 90% reduction by 2050. We accept that there will \nbe some residual emissions in 2040. These are allowed for in \nour 5% offset calculations. \nOur first task has been to collect and refine our emissions \ndata; improving data accuracy remains our priority. Absolute \nemission reduction pathways are being calculated across \nall categories in all three scopes to enable us to measure \nprogress against five-yearly milestones. \nBut it is not just about making commitments and creating \npathways. There is urgent need for action if we are to secure  \na 51% reduction by 2030. Our figures in 2021 will give us a \nbetter idea of the challenges ahead, but the 19% reduction in \nour Scopes 1 and 2 emissions in 2020 from our 2018 baseline \nis a promising start. \nLooking ahead, our greatest challenge is our Scope 3 \nemissions: 96% of our footprint is made up from the \nproperties we manage on behalf of our clients. It is therefore \nessential that we collaborate with our clients on securing \naccurate data and motivate them to implement their own \nmitigation pathways.\nPlease read more about our commitment  \nto achieving net-zero and engage with us as  \nwe do the hard work to make this a reality.\nClimate change is the biggest existential challenge \nwe have ever faced\nRichard Batten  \nJLL Chief Sustainability Officer\nJLL is taking urgent \nclimate action to \naccelerate the transition \nto net-zero, enhance \nperformance, mitigate \nrisks, and shape the \nfuture of real estate for a \nbetter world \nAbout  \nJLL\nExecutive \nremarks\nOur progress to  \nnet-zero world\nLearn  \nmore\nOur journey  \nto net-zero\nOur headline  \nactions\n4 | Transition to net-zero\n5 | Transition to net-zero\nA better world is a  \nnet-zero world \nJLL commits to reduce \nabsolute scope 1, 2 and \n3 emissions by 51% by \n2030, and 95% by 2040, \nfrom a 2018 base year\nA ‘code red for humanity’ , issued by the United Nations \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in The Sixth  \nAssessment Report, is a call on\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
