Further information on \nour principal risks and approach to risk management is \non page 42. \nAll papers submitted to the Board or its Committees \nare required to include a summary of key risks, how \nrelevant stakeholders have been considered in the \nproposals and the governance process undertaken prior \nto seeking Board approval to ensure that stakeholder \ninterests or concerns have been considered and that \nproposals have been through appropriate review and \napproval processes prior to submission to the Board. \nThis assists the Board in making well-informed decisions \nthat promote the long-term, sustainable success of \nthe business. \nAs mentioned above, our sustainability strategy is \nfounded on responsible business conduct management, \nto take a more proactive approach to ensuring that \nBupa conducts its activities in a responsible way. \nMore details can be found in the Sustainability \nand ESG section under Business ethics on page 33. \nThe Governance section commencing on page 50 \ndescribes the role of the Board, the Directors, Bupa’s \nsystem of governance, including the 'three lines model'; \nhow we have complied with the Code during the year; \nand the role and activities of each Committee of the \nBoard. It also specifically sets out how the Board and \nCommittees oversee sustainability and ESG matters. \nStrategic decisions and their impact on stakeholders \nThe table below sets out a number of decisions taken by the Board during the year and how stakeholder views \nwere taken into account. Further information on some of these decisions can be found in the Leadership section \non page 51. \nSupporting our people \nPeople \nIssue Action and progress Further information \nOur people are the driving \nforce behind our business and \nwe need to take care of them \nso that they can enjoy longer, \nhealthier, happier lives. \nWe have seen increasing \npressure on the capacity and \nresilience of our workforce \nfrom the COVID-19 pandemic, \ncost of living crisis and the \nlevel of change that we are \nasking them to undertake to \nachieve our 3x6 strategy. \nThere is also increasing \npressure on public health \nservices, making the \naccessibility and affordability \nof healthcare an important \nissue for our people. \nAction \nThe Board regularly receives updates on issues relating to Bupa's \npeople, with the Risk Committee closely monitoring workforce risks. \nWe have recognised the impact of the rising cost of living, particularly \non our frontline people, by endorsing appropriate actions taken by \nlocal management in different parts of Bupa. This has included bringing \nforward pay increases by several months and providing one-off \npayments to help ease the cost of living. \nThe Board agreed with the Group CEO that 100% of our people globally \nshould receive healthcare benefits, bringing a degree of consistency across \nbusinesses in terms of support available while also reflecting local market \ndifferences. The Board considered proposals from each Market Unit on \nwhat would provide the most value to their employees and agreed to \nsignificantly increase investment in healthcare benefits for employees with \nthe majority of the investment being used to support our frontline staff. A \nnew programme called Viva was launched in January 2023 across Bupa to \nimplement this decision. \nThe designated non-executive directors involved in workforce engagement \nactivities have seen first hand the positive reaction to these changes. \nLong-term impact \nThe Board believes that the investment in healthcare benefits for all \nemployees globally will make a real difference to the long-term health \nof our people and differentiates Bupa from competitors, giving us an \nadvantage in attracting and retaining employees. \nPeople and \nculture section \non page 18 \nLeadership on \npage 51 \nBupa Annual Report 2022 39 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nStrategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements \nSection 172 statement continued \nSustainability strategy \nCommunities and the environment \nIssue Action and progress Further information \nSustainability is a pillar of our \n3x6 strategy and the Board \nwanted to establish a cohesive \nframework to clearly identify \nthe actions Bupa can take to \nhave the greatest impact in \ndelivering the ‘making a better \nworld’ part of our purpose. \nOur customers, our people, \nregulators and wider society \nincreasingly expect large \norganisations to address \nsustainability and climate \nchange issues. These issues \npresent both risks and \nopportunities to the long-term \nviability of our business. \nAction \nThe Board Sustainability Committee led the development of the \nsustainability strategy which was approved by the Board in early \n2022 and launched in Q4 2022. \nWe had already publicly committed to become a net zero business \nby 2040 and this forms part of the 'Mission Zero’ pillar of the new \nsustainability strategy. Following approval of the sustainability strategy, \nthe Committee oversaw the development of the initial priorities to focus \non. Actions taken during the year include: launching the Sustainability \nAcademy to equip our people with the skills and information they need to \nensure that we run Bupa in a sustainable way; and running our second eco-\nDisruptive programme. In addition, Bupa expanded its work in promoting \ninclusivity by becoming the official health partner for the national \nParalympics Associations in Australia and the UK, in addition to \nexisting partnerships in Spain, Poland and Chile. \nStakeholder considerations \nAn external consultancy was engaged to carry out a materiality assessment \nto help prioritise Bupa’s investment in actions that will have the greatest \npositive impact and\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BUPA<|><organization><|>Bupa is a global healthcare company focused on health insurance, care services, and promoting wellbeing, with strategic initiatives including sustainability, employee support, and governance practices)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOARD<|><organization><|>The Board is responsible for overseeing company strategy, risk management, sustainability, and stakeholder engagement, including approving policies and strategic decisions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RISK COMMITTEE<|><organization><|>The Risk Committee monitors workforce risks and other strategic risks to ensure effective risk management within Bupa)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUSTAINABILITY COMMITTEE<|><organization><|>The Sustainability Committee leads the development and implementation of Bupa's sustainability strategy, including climate change initiatives and social responsibility programs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GROUP CEO<|><person><|>The Group CEO is responsible for leading Bupa's overall management, implementing board decisions, and overseeing strategic initiatives such as healthcare benefits and sustainability efforts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARALYMPICS ASSOCIATIONS<|><organization><|>Official health partners for promoting inclusivity and health initiatives in Australia, UK, Spain, Poland, and Chile, supporting Bupa's diversity and social impact goals)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PAGE 42<|><event><|>Page 42 references Bupa's principal risks and approach to risk management as part of its reporting and governance documentation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PAGE 33<|><event><|>Page 33 contains details on Bupa's sustainability and ESG strategies, including responsible business conduct and climate commitments)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PAGE 50<|><event><|>Page 50 describes the governance structure, including the role of the Board and its Committees, and how they oversee sustainability and ESG matters)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PAGE 51<|><event><|>Page 51 discusses strategic decisions taken by the Board and stakeholder considerations in those decisions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19 PANDEMIC<|><event><|>The COVID-19 pandemic has increased pressure on Bupa's workforce capacity and resilience, influencing company actions and policies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COST OF LIVING CRISIS<|><event><|>The rising cost of living has impacted Bupa's employees, prompting actions such as pay increases and support programs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VIVA<|><organization><|>Viva is a new healthcare benefits program launched across Bupa in January 2023 to support employee wellbeing)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY<|><organization><|>Bupa's sustainability strategy, approved in early 2022, aims to achieve net zero by 2040 and includes initiatives like the Sustainability Academy and eco-disruptive programs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MISSION ZERO<|><organization><|>Bupa's initiative to become a net zero business by 2040, part of its sustainability strategy)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INFORMATION SECURITY<|><organization><|>Information security is a key focus area for Bupa, ensuring data protection and privacy in healthcare and operational activities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DATA QUALITY<|><organization><|>Bupa emphasizes data quality to improve clinical governance, patient outcomes, and operational efficiency)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLINICAL GOVERNANCE<|><organization><|>Bupa's framework for maintaining high standards in healthcare delivery and patient safety)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STAKEHOLDERS<|><person><|>Stakeholders include employees, customers, regulators, and society, whose interests are considered in Bupa's decision-making processes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PAGE 18<|><event><|>Page 18 discusses Bupa's People and Culture initiatives, including support for employees and workforce resilience)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PAGE 51<|><event><|>Page 51 covers leadership and strategic decision-making, including stakeholder engagement and governance practices)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
