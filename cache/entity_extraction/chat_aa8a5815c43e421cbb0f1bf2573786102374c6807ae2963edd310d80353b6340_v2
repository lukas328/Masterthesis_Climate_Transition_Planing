In 2003, Mizuho Bank became the first financial \ninstitution in Asia to adopt the Equator Principles. \n \n(3) Implementation of our Environmental and Social Management Policy for Financing and Investment Activity \nOur core group companies implement the Environmental and Social Management Policy for Financing and Investment Activity in \nline with the characteristics of their respective businesses and have developed verification processes for the screening stage and \nthroughout the transaction term (Table 11). In regard to governance, the Executive Management Committee and other committees \nregularly review whether the policy is appropriate and sufficient, with consideration to changes in the external business \nenvironment and the results of implementation. Following these reviews, said committees revise the policy and enhance its \nimplementation. Further, our employees and executive officers are also being well informed and trained. \n \nTable 11: Implementation of Environmental and Social Management Policy for Financing and Investment Activity \nVerification \nprocess when \nscreening a \npotential \ntransaction \n We confirm/determine whether or not the prospective client or project for any financing or investment belongs \nto one of the industries or sectors stipulated in the policy. \n In the event we find when determining whether or not to engage in the transaction that the prospective client \ndoes belong to one of these sectors, in line with the policy we may prohibit financing and investment or we \nmay confirm the degree to which the client has taken steps to avoid or mitigate risk and other due diligence \nas appropriate, based on the characteristics of the services we are providing. \nVerification \nprocess during \nthe transaction \nterm \n Core group companies engage (hold constructive dialogue) with clients in transition risk sectors and specific \nindustrial sectors at least once yearly in line with the characteristics of their respective businesses. (See \npages 73 to 83 for the confirmation standards used in engagement.) \n- Verify the degree to which clients have taken steps to avoid or mitigate environmental and social risks. \n- With clients in transition risk sectors, discuss medium- to long-term issues and confirm the status of the \nclient’s response in regard to climate change opportunities and risks. \n In the event that we identify any acts in violation of the policy during the term of a transaction, we determine \nwhether or not to continue the transaction after responding to the discovery, such as by urging the client to \ntake immediate remedial measures, based on the characteristics of the services we are providing. \nGovernance \n Our business execution and supervisory lines (see page 14 for details on governance) regularly review \nwhether our measures related to the risks, sectors, and other factors are appropriate and sufficient, with \nconsideration to changes in the external business environment and the results of implementation. Following \nthese reviews, they may revise or otherwise make changes to our policies to enhance their implementation. \nEducation and \ntraining  To ensure effective risk management, employees and executive officers participate in education and training. \nStakeholder \ncommunication \n We place a strong emphasis on engagement with stakeholders to ensure that our initiatives are aligned with \nsociety’s standards and expectations \n \n(4) Environmental and Social Management Policy for Financing and Investment Activity enhancements and advances \nMizuho periodically revises the policy and strengthens initiatives to avoid and mitigate adverse impacts on the environment and \nsociety. This serves to further our measures to respond to climate change, protect biodiversity, and respect human rights and to \nreflect the expectations and perspectives of stakeholders. \n \nIn March 2022, we revised the elements of the policy that cover transition risk sectors, the coal-fired power generation sector, \nand the thermal coal mining sector in order to enhance our measures to address climate change (Figure 19; see pages 73 to 83 \nfor details on the policy).  \n  \nTCFD Report 2022  -57- \n \nFigure 19: Overview of Environmental and Social Management Policy for Financing and Investment Activity  \nand status of additions and revisions (climate change-related) \nTargeted sectors Policy (Underlines indicate revisions made in March 2022.) \nTransition Risk Sectors \n \nTargets \n・ Companies whose primary businesses are in power generation (coal-fired, oil-fired, gas-\nfired), coal mining, oil and gas, steel, or cement. \nPolicies \n・ Proactively undertake engagement to support transition to a low-carbon society. \n・ Check at least once per year on the status of transition risk response, based on the following \ncriteria.
