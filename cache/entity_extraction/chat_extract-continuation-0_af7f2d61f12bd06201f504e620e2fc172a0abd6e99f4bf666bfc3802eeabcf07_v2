In 2022, the Board focused on reviewing our strategy \nand considered employee feedback from The Big Listen. This employee survey was designed \nto uncover strengths and barriers to our success from the bottom up. Since The Big Listen, \nemployee engagement has continued to be led by management, as we communicated our \nrefreshed strategy. Town halls and team sessions took place at all levels across the group \nto share our vision, play to win behaviours and provide progress updates on the execution \nof our strategy. This was an essential part of ensuring our people had the chance to discuss \nand question management to better understand their role in delivering our ambitions. \nThe town halls also provided a platform to communicate the cultural and behavioural \nchanges that are vital for the successful delivery of our strategy. \nEach year the Board conducts site visits to see operations first hand, meet colleagues and \ndevelop a better understanding of the culture. During the Board’s visit to our Technology \nCentre in Sonning in September 2022, the directors met with employees informally over \nlunch, providing an opportunity for open discussion and the chance for directors to hear \nthe views of our colleagues without having structured topics of discussion. \nAs described on page 73, this is an area where the Board has not complied with the Code. \nIt was felt that following the strategic review, direct engagement between management and \nour employees was paramount to ensure the new cultural ambition and strategy was well \nunderstood. The Board had previously considered employee engagement methods specified \nby the Code and felt that our global and diverse employee network required a different \napproach. We established engagement focus groups in countries where we have a significant \nfootprint, each led by a board member. Following the communication of our strategy, the \nBoard intends to re-establish simplified groups for 2023/24 to obtain a greater insight into \nthe views of our employees. The directors will report back to the Board on the key messages \nthey have heard from their engagement focus group and any actions arising will be \nmonitored through the year by regular reports.\nProtecting people and the planet\nActing with integrity Innovating and improving\nWorking together Owning what we do\nCatalysing the net zero transition\nOur culture\nOur values\nFocus Simplify Execute\nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 202380\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION\nInduction and training\nAll new directors receive comprehensive and tailored inductions during their first year at JM \nto gain a deeper understanding of how we work. Induction plans are adapted to support \neach director in meeting their statutory duties. Through the plan, directors develop a deep \nunderstanding of our strategic priorities, as well as an insight into our purpose, values \nand culture. \nFollowing their induction, each director receives regular briefings from external advisers \nor teach-ins on items of strategic importance as part of regular board training. In September \n2022, as part of continuous development, the Board received a schedule of teach-ins, which \nwere delivered by subject matter experts from across the group. These covered Hydrogen \nTechnologies, PGM chemistry and applications, renewables and electrochemical \ntransformations, Clean Air (specifically, ammonia cracking, hydrogen ICE and methane \nabatement), digitalisation of R&D, and metals. This provided the Board with insights into \nthe business and an opportunity to ask questions of the wider workforce about the detailed \nareas in which they work. \nDuring the year, external legal advisors also provided an update on the UK Market Abuse \nRegulation. All board members receive regular training on climate-related issues through the \nSocietal Value Committee, where external specialists are invited to present at each meeting. \nThe auditors also presented regulatory updates to the Audit Committee, including the key \nchanges for the next financial year.\nThroughout each year, all directors receive information on mandatory training topics, including \non health and safety, information security and ethics and compliance matters. Legal and \ngovernance updates are regularly provided by the General Counsel and Company Secretary.\nThe skills and experience of our board members are regularly assessed to ensure they \ncontinue to be well placed to provide insight on our purpose and strategy.
