integration into our risk appetite framework and comprehensive \nrisk management \n- We are identifying transition and physical risks resulting from climate change and integrating them into \nour risk appetite framework and our comprehensive risk management framework for credit, operational, \nand other types of risk. \n Our management of top risks \n- Under our management of “top risks ”, which are risks recogni zed by management as having major \npotential impact on Mizuho,  we position increasing severity of climate change impacts as a “top risk”. \nWhen we have selected a top risk, we consider additional risk control measures and report on the status \nof our response to the Board of Directors and other committees. \n Risk control in carbon-related sectors \n- We are establishing a structure to assess risk in carbon-related sectors (electric utilities, oil, gas, coal, \nsteel, and cement  sectors) along two axes —our clients’ sectors, and our clients ’ measures to address \ntransition risk—in order to identify and monitor high-risk areas. \n- We control risk in high-risk areas under the following exposure control policy. \n We are more thoroughly engaging with clients to support them in formulating effective strategies for \ntransition risks, in disclosing their progress, and in embarking on business structure transformation \ntowards a lower risk sector at an early stage. \n With the aim of facilitating business structure transformation, we provide any necessary support when \nwe have been able to confirm that the client has set valid targets and planned an appropriate transition \nstrategy in line with international standards. \n We carefully consider whether or not to continue our business with a client in the event that the client \nis not willing to address transition risk and has not formulated a transition strategy even one year after \nthe initial engagement. \n In this way, we are reducing our exposure over the medium to long term. \n Environmental and Social Management Policy for Financing and Investment Activity \n- We have established and implemented a management policy for financing and investment that specifies \nprojects and sectors with a particularly high likelihood of leading to adverse impacts on the environment \nand society (transition risk sectors, coal-fired power generation, thermal coal mining, oil and gas, etc.). \n- The business execution and supervisory lines periodically review changes in the external business \nenvironment and the outcomes of the implementation of the policy. Following this review, they revise the \npolicy and improve its implementation. \np. 48 \n \n \n \n \n \np. 49 \n \n \n \n \n \npp. 50 – 54 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npp. 55 – 57 \n  \nCEO message\nOverview/Introduction\nGovernance\nStrategy\nRisk management\nMetrics and targets\nConclusion\nAppendix\n \n-10- Mizuho Financial Group \n \nMetrics and \ntargets \nDisclose the metrics and targets used to assess and manage relevant climate- related risks and opportunities \nwhere such information is material. \n \nMain monitoring indicators Targets Recent results \nScope 1 and 2 emissions5 \nCarbon neutral by FY2030 \n(Carbon neutrality to be maintained \nthereafter) \nFY2020: 169,237 tCO2 \nScope 3 (emissions from \nfinancing and investment) Net zero by 2050 N/A \n- Electric power sector FY2030: 138 to 232 kgCO2/MWh FY2020: 388 kgCO2/MWh \nSustainable finance and \nenvironmental finance \nTotal for FY2019 to FY2030: \n¥25 trillion  \n(of which the target for environmental \nfinance is ¥12 trillion) \nTotal for FY2019 to FY2021: \n¥13.1 trillion  \n(of which the results for \nenvironmental finance is ¥4.6 \ntrillion) \nTarget to reduce the outstanding \ncredit balance for coal-fired \npower generation facilities \nbased on our Environmental and \nSocial Management Policy for \nFinancing and Investment \nActivity \nReduce the FY2019 amount by 50% \nby FY2030, and achieve an \noutstanding credit balance of zero by \nFY2040 \nMarch 31, 2022: ¥248.6 billion \n(-17.0% compared to the end of \nFY2019) \nExposure to high-risk areas \nwithin transition risk sectors Reduce over the medium to long term March 31, 2022: ¥1.6 trillion \n \npp. 58 – 67 \n  \nItems for disclosure aside from monitoring indicators: \n- Sector-by-sector credit exposure in line with the TCFD Recommendations \n- Greenhouse gas emissions from financing and investment (“financed emissions”) based on PCAF methodology \n  \n                                         \n5 Targets of analysis / scope of data collection: Seven group companies (Mizuho Financial Group, Mizuho Bank, Mizuho Trust & Banking, \nMizuho Securities, Mizuho Research & Technologies, Asset Management One, and Mizuho Americas). \n  \nTCFD Report 2022  -11- \n \n3.
