It is important to note that \nwe will only apply decarbonisation \nlevers where we believe it is in the \nbest interest of customers.\nDeveloped \nhigh level \nstrategy \nMade initial investments of c.£0.7bn\n3\n39\nPhoenix Group Holdings plc Net Zero Transition Plan\nInvest Engage Lead\nEmbedding net zero \nin our business\nBecoming a \nnet zero business Measuring our progress\nExecutive \nsummary\nMonitor and refine \nAssessing the likelihood of meeting our targets\nIf the actions we have already \ncommitted to are implemented then \nwe believe we will be on track to \nachieve our 2025 interim target. This \nassessment has been informed by our \nprogress to date and supported by our \nforward-looking emissions pathway \nprojection tool (described on page 28) \nwhich has been used to test a range of \npotential, plausible economy-wide \ndecarbonisation and asset growth \nrate scenarios. \nHow likely we are to achieve our 2030 target is \ncurrently less certain. We are also significantly \nmore dependent on action by others, notably \ngovernments and high-emitting sectors, to meet \nour 2030 targets, and there is greater uncertainty \nin the pace of decarbonisation over this longer \ntime period, which adds further layers of \nuncertainty to our modelling. \nEven in the near term, we face significant \nuncertainty around how quickly the wider \neconomy will decarbonise, asset growth rates and \nthe effectiveness of our actions in meeting our \ntargets. Therefore, while our emissions pathway \nprojection tool has been used to explore possible \noutcomes to give us a useful sense of where we \nstand, there are significant limitations in its use \nwhich may mean that actual outcomes vary greatly \nfrom those explored and meeting our targets is \nmore or less difficult than expected.\nChallenges and dependencies to decarbonising \nour investment portfolio\nWe need a step change in action, to transform \neconomies to embed sustainability into every \nfinancial decision and combat the climate crisis. \nDecarbonising investment portfolios and financing \nto productive and sustainable assets including \nclimate solutions at scale is going to require new \napproaches to investment, government policy \nand financial regulation. We set out these key \nchallenges and interdependencies below:\n• Government policy frameworks:  We need net \nzero-aligned government policy that provides \nthe necessary signals and support to enable \nindustry and investors to make large, long-term \nstrategic commitments that will enable private \nsector investment into climate solutions flow at \nscale. We plan to increase investments in illiquid \nassets and sustainable investments, but only if \nthere are the right regulatory and market \nconditions.\n• Government regulation: Supportive financial \nsector regulation including reforms to Solvency \nII and Long-Term Asset Funds, and the review of \nperformance fees and charge caps for defined \ncontribution pension schemes may enable asset \nowners and pension providers to invest a greater \nproportion of policyholder assets in long-term \nilliquid assets such as green infrastructure.\n• High transition risk sectors: A significant \nproportion of our financed emissions are \nconcentrated in a small number of high transition \nrisk sectors. We are therefore dependent on \ninvestee companies having credible transition \nplans, which are aligned to net zero transition \npathways for their sector.\n• Voluntary carbon markets: We are dependent \nupon the scaling up of voluntary carbon markets \nto enable a supply of credible carbon reduction \noffsets to be used by investee companies where \nthey cannot reduce emissions to absolute zero.\n• Asset classes/areas in which it is challenging to \ndrive change: There are certain asset classes \nand areas in which we are invested that will be \nmuch more challenging to decarbonise. For \nexample, sovereign debt investments make up a \nconsiderable portion of our AUA and are held \nfor regulatory capital and liquidity purposes, and \nso we have limited flexibility to be able to divest \nat scale. In addition, it is difficult to meaningfully \ninfluence the decarbonisation trajectory \nassociated with sovereign debt investments, \nwithout considerable commitment from the \nrelevant governmental body raising the finance. \nWe also do not have direct control over external \nfund links (‘EFLs’) and so are ultimately reliant on \nthird party fund managers taking action to \ndecarbonise. \n• Ability to influence as an equity vs. debt \ninvestor: In 2022, we expanded our carbon \nemission baseline to include real estate assets \n(including both debt and equity investments). \nEquity ownership gives us greater flexibility to \nshape the future decarbonisation trajectory at \nan individual property level (e.g. by way of \nadvocating for the retrofitting of buildings to \nimprove their EPC rating). There may be fewer \nopportunities to influence our debt investments, \non the other hand, other than at initial investment \nand/or at refinancing opportunities. \n4\n40\nPhoenix Group Holdings plc Net Zero Transition Plan\nInvest Engage Lead\nEmbedding net zero \nin our business\nBecoming a \nnet zero business Measuring our progress\nExecutive \nsummary\nIn 2023 we will review our progress \nagainst a net-zero\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PHOENIX GROUP HOLDINGS PLC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A financial services company that has developed a Net Zero Transition Plan to embed sustainability and achieve emissions reduction targets by 2025 and 2030, including investments and strategic initiatives to decarbonize its investment portfolio and operations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NET ZERO TRANSITION PLAN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A strategic plan developed by Phoenix Group Holdings to transition to net zero emissions by 2050, focusing on embedding sustainability into business practices, measuring progress, and addressing challenges in decarbonization)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NET ZERO<|>EVENT<|>A global environmental goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero, which Phoenix Group aims to achieve through its transition plan and strategic investments)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOVERNMENT POLICY FRAMEWORKS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Government policies that support decarbonization efforts, providing signals and support for industry and investors to make long-term climate commitments)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOVERNMENT REGULATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Regulatory frameworks such as Solvency II and Long-Term Asset Funds reforms that influence financial sector investments and decarbonization strategies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VOLUNTARY CARBON MARKETS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Markets where companies can purchase credible carbon offsets to compensate for emissions they cannot eliminate, crucial for decarbonizing sectors with high transition risks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HIGH TRANSITION RISK SECTORS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sectors with significant emissions and challenges in decarbonization, requiring credible transition plans from investee companies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOVEREIGN DEBT INVESTMENTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Debt investments in government bonds, which are difficult to influence directly for decarbonization due to limited control over external government actions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REAL ESTATE ASSETS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Assets including debt and equity investments in properties, where decarbonization can be influenced through retrofitting and improving energy performance)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EMISSIONS PATHWAY PROJECTION TOOL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A modeling tool used by Phoenix Group to assess progress towards emissions targets and explore plausible decarbonization scenarios)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOVERNMENTS<|>PERSON<|>Authorities whose actions and policies significantly impact the success of decarbonization efforts and the achievement of net zero targets)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HIGH-EMITTING SECTORS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Industries with substantial greenhouse gas emissions that are critical to decarbonization strategies)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PHOENIX GROUP HOLDINGS PLC<|>NET ZERO TRANSITION PLAN<|>The company developed the plan to guide its sustainability and decarbonization efforts<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NET ZERO TRANSITION PLAN<|>GOVERNMENT POLICY FRAMEWORKS<|>The plan relies on supportive policies to enable large-scale private investment<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NET ZERO TRANSITION PLAN<|>GOVERNMENT REGULATION<|>The plan depends on regulatory reforms to facilitate decarbonization investments<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NET ZERO TRANSITION PLAN<|>VOLUNTARY CARBON MARKETS<|>The plan includes reliance on carbon offsets from voluntary markets<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HIGH TRANSITION RISK SECTORS<|>PHOENIX GROUP<|>The company’s decarbonization efforts focus on sectors with high transition risks<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SOVEREIGN DEBT INVESTMENTS<|>PHOENIX GROUP<|>Investments in government bonds that are challenging to influence for decarbonization<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>REAL ESTATE ASSETS<|>PHOENIX GROUP<|>Assets where decarbonization can be influenced through property-level actions<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EMISSIONS PATHWAY PROJECTION TOOL<|>PHOENIX GROUP<|>Used to assess progress and explore decarbonization scenarios<|>8)\n##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
