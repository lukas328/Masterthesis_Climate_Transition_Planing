During the year \nthe Committee reviewed the Group’s final IFRS 17 \ntechnical accounting policies, material policy \napplication judgements, transition adjustments to the \nGroup’s 2022 opening reserves under IFRS 17 and the \ndisclosures in the Annual Report regarding the effect \nof that transition. \nIT general controls \nWe reported last year on the remediation programme \nunder way to uplift information security and IT general \ncontrols. This is an ongoing process in a fast-evolving \narea and remains an area of interest to the Committee. \nGroup Reporting Controls Environment \nThe Committee considered a review of the Group’s \nIFRS consolidation and wider production process for \nthe Annual Report and Accounts, considering the risks \nacross the end-to-end process and the associated first \nline key control and governance processes which were \nin place to support the production of timely, complete, \nand accurate disclosures. The Committee was satisfied \nwith management’s self-assessment that the control \nenvironment concerning Group reporting was effective. \nFor future assessments, the Committee requested that \nadditional strategic perspectives be considered in order \nto pre-empt potential risks to the process and to \nidentify potential mitigants for such risks. \nAssurance over our 2021 GHG \nEmissions Report \nDuring the year, the Board Sustainability Committee \nasked the Committee to oversee the internal and \nexternal assurance over Bupa’s Scope 1, 2 and selected \nScope 3 GHG emissions footprint (GHG Emissions \nFootprint). Having a complete and accurate baseline \nGHG Emissions Footprint is important to measure \nprogress in achieving Bupa’s net zero ambition, and \nhaving this data externally assured gives the data \nadditional credibility, and provides reassurance to \nexternal stakeholders that they can trust the data \nwe publish. The baseline year is 2019. \nIn June 2022, the Committee approved the engagement \nof PwC to carry out limited assurance over the Group’s \nGHG Emissions Footprint for 2021 in view of their ability \nto carry out high-quality assurance and ability to cover \nBupa’s complex geographical presence and mix of \nbusiness lines. The Committee also received updates \non the progress of internal and external assurance \nactivities covering processes and controls, and the \ncompleteness of the GHG Emissions Footprint. \nIn November 2022, the Committee met jointly with the \nBoard Sustainability Committee to consider Bupa’s \ndraft 2021 GHG Emissions Report and PwC’s limited \nassurance report. The Committee also reviewed and \nchallenged the materiality level and level of \nmanagement discretion proposed in a draft GHG \nemissions recalculation policy at which baseline \nemissions data would be recalculated to account \nfor significant events such as large acquisitions or \ndivestments. This policy had been developed in \nline with the GHG Protocol published by the World \nResources Institute and the World Business Council \nfor Sustainable Development. \nThe final 2021 GHG Emissions Report and PwC’s limited \nassurance report were reviewed by the Committee in \nDecember 2022 and the Committee recommended the \n2021 GHG Emissions Report to the Board for approval. \nBupa Annual Report 2022 68 \n     \n   \n        \n       \n         \n        \n        \n        \n       \n      \n         \n        \n       \n       \n       \n         \n       \n         \n    \n       \n       \n         \n           \n  \n        \n         \n            \n           \n    \n       \n           \n          \n        \n         \n          \n        \n       \n          \n        \n \n      \n       \n      \n       \n        \n       \n      \n        \n        \n         \n         \n         \n          \n           \n          \n        \n            \n         \n  \n         \n    \n \n        \n        \n         \n        \n     \n     \n         \n          \n      \n     \n        \n       \n         \n          \n         \n     \n         \n        \n      \n         \n         \n          \n  \n          \n   \n   \nStrategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements \nAudit Committee report continued \nSignificant issues and areas of judgement \nKey issue Committee response \nGoodwill and intangible assets \nSignificant levels of goodwill and intangibles are held \nin respect of prior acquisitions.
