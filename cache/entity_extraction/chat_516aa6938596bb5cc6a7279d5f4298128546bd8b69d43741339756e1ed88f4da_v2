At target, over 50% of the Executive Directors’ remuneration is based on individual \nand Company performance. \nThis graph illustrates the potential remuneration outcomes variation for different levels of performance using the \nincumbents’ bonusable salary in 2023 to calculate the MBS values and 1 March 2023 to calculate the SPP values. \nPerformance measures and target setting \nMeasures and targets for the MBS are aligned with \ndelivery of Bupa’s annual operating plan and may \ninclude personal objectives that change from \nyear to year. \nMeasures and targets for the SPP are set by the \nCommittee, taking into account internal and external \nreference points which include historic Bupa \nperformance, internal forward-looking plans and \nbroader market trends. Targets are set for vesting at \nthreshold, target and maximum performance levels. \nCommittee discretion \nThe Committee has ultimate discretion over all \nincentive plans relating to the Executive Directors \nand other individuals within its remit. This includes, \nbut is not limited to: \n▪ Determining the size of the award/payment \n▪ Determining whether minimum levels of performance \nhave been met or underlying performance is \nsatisfactory before determining the vesting of \nany awards \n▪ Determining whether the management of risk \nhas been acceptable, or whether any downward \nadjustments are required \n▪ Selecting or adjusting performance measures \nwithin the Remuneration Policy and the plan rules \n▪ Determining whether individuals are ‘good leavers’ \nfor incentive plan purposes, based on plan rules \n▪ Making one-off adjustments in exceptional \ncircumstances. \nApproach to Remuneration Policy on \nrecruitment of an Executive Director \nOur approach to remuneration on recruitment is to pay \nno more than is necessary and appropriate to attract \nthe right talent to the role. \nThe Remuneration Policy table on page 92 sets out \nthe various components which would be considered \nfor inclusion in the remuneration package for the \nappointment of an Executive Director. Typically, a new \nappointment will be placed (or be transitioned) onto \nthe framework that applies to other Executive Directors \nas set out in the policy table. Salary would reflect the \nskills and experience of the individual, and may be set \nat a level to allow future salary progression to reflect \nperformance in the role. \nIt would be expected that the structure and quantum \nof the variable pay elements would reflect those set \nout in the policy table. \nBupa Annual Report 2022 94 \n        \n        \n          \n          \n         \n           \n        \n        \n       \n      \n       \n           \n         \n       \n \n          \n      \n     \n \n    \n        \n       \n        \n         \n       \n        \n    \n    \n    \n  \n        \n         \n          \n     \n        \n       \n          \n   \n        \n         \n         \n          \n        \n      \n      \n \n      \n         \n           \n      \n          \n          \n   \n    \n      \n       \n        \n         \n     \n        \n          \n           \n        \n     \n \n  \n   \n  \n    \n \n         \n                \n               \n               \n   \n     \n   \n               \n             \n               \n     \n               \n   \n     \n   \n               \n           \n            \n               \n               \n                \n              \n                \n                 \n       \n          \n  \n   \n   \nStrategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements \nDirectors’ remuneration report \nPart 3: Policy continued \nThe Committee reserves the right to make any \nremuneration payments or payments for loss of office \nwhere the terms of the payment were agreed: (i) before \nthe Remuneration Policy came\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
