The automation of the pur-\nchase confirmation emission process, legal contracts and \ncontracting of freight is performed through the Robotics \nProcess Automation system.\nInnovations with EESG benefits are on the radar for our \nsupply processes. In 2022, we developed an innovative \nsolution for the drying of grains at 14 branches in Bra-\nzil. Under the new process, we have replaced the use of \nwood logs with wood chips in the dryers, meaning greater \nefficiency and safety, as well as cost reduction, thanks to \nthe automation - without having to transport the wood \nlogs manually. The process means a potential reduction of \nup to 15% in the grain drying time and 60% in labor costs, \nwhilst also resulting in a more uniform generation of heat, \nthus benefiting the quality of the grain, ensuring a more \neconomical use of the raw-material (chips, obtained from \nour own reforestation projects and supplied by third par-\nties) and a reduction in the consumption of electricity.  \nBRF is committed to \nguaranteeing the traceability \nof 100% of the grains bought \nfrom the Amazon and Cerrado \nregions by 2025\n2022 Integrated  \nReport\nOur way of  \ndoing business\nOur strategy\nCulture and \nEngagement\nValue Generation\nIndicators  \nand annex\n3\n4\n5\n6\n2\nPresentation1\n47\nLogistics 4.0\nAnother important front in relation to digital transforma-\ntion is that of Logistics 4.0, with the focus being the mon-\nitoring of the fleets; the joint development of solutions \nrelating to efficiency, emissions control, and health and \nsafety; as well as the quality control of the transportation \nof live cargo, finished products and inputs.\nIn 2022, we expanded the fatigue control program, involv-\ning digital monitoring of drivers’ conditions, an essential \nmeasure for the prevention of accidents and improve-\nment of safety rates. We have invested in optimizing the \nroutes through the use of more digital control over the \nmovements of transport vehicles forming part of the BRF \nlogistics chain.\nEvery one of BRF's production units in Brazil now form \npart of the 4.0 platform dedicated to monitoring more \nthan 9,000 vehicles. Also in 2022, chatbots were intro-\nduced into the logistics system, providing a new channel \nof communication with the drivers working for the trans-\nportation companies, improving request and response \ntimes and improving the operating times as a whole. This \nshows how technology is facilitating our day-to-day rou-\ntines and increasing efficiency and productivity.\nIndustry 4.0\nThis journey includes an incremental modification of our \nway of operating, with automation and real time obser-\nvation of our industrial units through the installation of \nsensors and advanced analyses. \nIn 2022, we implemented a digital solution at our 26 man-\nufacturing units in Brazil, raising the level of data manage-\nment and tracking, and optimizing the working routine.\nThe platform involves the digitization of 15 processes that \nmake up BRF’s Auto-control Programs (PAC), with more \nthan 5,000 people being impacted through the use of the \napp and the recorded data concerning the monitoring \nof the processes, thereby better streamlining the control \nand solidity of the process.  \nExcellence programs\nThe establishment of the business plan is increasingly \nlinked to an intelligent use of our industrial units, reduc-\ning inactivity, waste, absenteeism and accidents, and \noptimizing process times.\nSince 2022, the program has been simplified, with the \naim of improving performance and efficiency through the \nuse of manufacturing process indicators. Furthermore, a \nsynergy has been established between the SEO and the \n‘More Logistics Excellence’ programs, aiming to integrate \nthe processes and optimize costs along the chain.\nAs a means of making improvements in this area, we \nhave an Operational Excellence (OpEx) System, involving \na set of actions relating to technological modernization, \ndigitalization and gains in productivity which, over the last \ntwo years, has produced important results.
