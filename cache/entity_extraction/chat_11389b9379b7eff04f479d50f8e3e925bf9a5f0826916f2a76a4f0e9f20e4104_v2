This was largely due to COVID-19 restrictions which contributed \nto workforce challenges and constrained admissions as well as the sale or \nclosure of nine homes in 2021. Closing occupancy was 84% (2021: 87%). \nHigher labour, infection prevention and control costs also contributed \nto the decreases. \nIn New Zealand Villages and Aged Care, revenue was broadly in line with \n2021 as new developments and government funding increases offset \ndivestments and site closures. Underlying loss increased primarily due \nto the impact of COVID-19 on occupancy, as well as higher labour costs. \nAs part of continued portfolio optimisation, we opened a new retirement \nvillage and adjacent care home and closed three care homes. Closing \noccupancy was 87% (2021: 88%). \nIn Hong Kong SAR, revenue increased due to strong COVID-19 vaccination \nclinic volumes and pricing. We provided more than 12,500 virtual \nconsultations and opened seven new medical and dental centres. This was \ndespite COVID-19 restrictions in place during the first half of the year and \nvisitor entry restrictions remaining in place for the majority of the year. \nThe impact of COVID-19 on insurance claims did however contribute to \nan underlying loss. \nIn November, we announced that Hisham El-Ansary, CEO for Asia Pacific, \nwill step down at the end of March 2023 with an executive search process \ncurrently underway to find his replacement. Nick Stone, currently CFO for \nAsia Pacific, will become Acting CEO. \n1. Underlying profit includes £66m of undistributed health insurance claims savings related to \nCOVID-19. This is intended to be returned to Australian health insurance customers in line\nwith our commitment to not benefit from COVID-19. Future health insurance underlying\nprofit will be impacted by the cost of any amounts returned to customers at the point such\na return is announced.\n2. Combined operating ratio is an alternative performance metric for insurance businesses. It is\ncalculated based on incurred claims and operating expenses divided by net earned premiums.\n3.

This included £40m profit \nas a result of applying higher CPI to historical periods in line \nwith a Public Private Partnership hospital contract in Spain. \nExcluding this, underlying profit growth was driven by organic \ncustomer growth in our Spanish health insurance business, \nSanitas Seguros, and in our business in Poland, LUX MED, \nalongside improved occupancy within our aged care \nbusiness in Spain, Sanitas Mayores. \nHealth insurance in Spain delivered good revenue growth with over \n100,000 more lives insured. Underlying profit increased through both \nportfolio growth and price increases which offset some inflationary \nheadwinds. We reached the milestone of two million customers in \nJune 2022, with distribution agreements with bancassurance partners \ncontributing to more than a third of sales. The COR for the full year \nwas 89%1 (2021: 88%). \nOur dental business in Spain continued to deliver good customer growth \nleading to improved revenue and underlying profit. We opened four new \ndental centres and acquired one that was previously operating through \na franchise model. \nIn our Hospitals and New Services business in Spain, revenue and underlying \nprofit increased after applying the historical CPI catchup, noted above. We \nalso opened a new laboratory and are building a new hospital in Madrid, \nwhich we expect to open in 2025. \nIn Sanitas Mayores, our aged care business in Spain, underlying profit \nincreased due to improved occupancy as we continued to emerge from \nthe pandemic (closing occupancy was 93%, up 6 ppts).
