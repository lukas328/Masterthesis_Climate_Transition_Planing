T o comply with the sub-\ncriteria Traceability of Substances, we have implemented a \nthird-party software to track substances of concern, which will \nenable us to trace the materials used to manufacture products \nthroughout their lifecycle.\nDNSH 4: Pollution Prevention and Control \nWe ensure that our Prohibited and Restricted Substance \nManagement document, used to regulate restricted and \nprohibited chemicals at all business levels and units at \nVestas, meets the standards necessary under the five \nsub-criteria: Persistent Organic Pollution, Mercury, Ozone \nDepleting substances, Substances in Electrical and Electronic \nEquipment, and certain dangerous substances. \nDNSH 5: Protection and Restoration of Biodiversity  \nand Ecosystems\nWe ensure that an EIA or screening has been performed in \naccordance with Directive 2011/92/EU for all necessary \nfacilities in the EU, and that the required mitigation and \ncompensation measures for protecting the environment \nare implemented where necessary. For facilities in countries \noutside the EU, we have ensured the presence of EIAs and \nwater permits equivalent to the standards of the EU.\nMinimum Safeguards\nOur Social Management System and Social Due Diligence \napproach is developed based on the United Nations Guiding \nPrinciples on Business and Human Rights (“UNGPs”) and \nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development \n(“OECD”) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. They \ncontain all the necessary requirements to be considered as \nadequate process for human rights due diligence as per Article \n18 of the Delegated Act.\nWe are compliant with the sub-criteria T axation through  \nour T ax Policy, which covers all decisions that directly or \nindirectly affect reporting and/or payment of taxes under \nthe liability of any Vestas Group Company, and our T ax Risk \nManagement reporting. \nOur Global Anti-Bribery and Corruption Programme consists \nof five pillars: programme governance, learning & awareness, \nculture & behaviour, monitoring & auditing, and EthicsLine. \nOur annual Global Anti-Bribery and Corruption Survey is \ntaken by Vestas employees globally and ensures that we have \nadequate anti-corruption processes in place in compliance \nwith Article 18 of the Delegated Act.\nOur Employee Code of Conduct and Supplier Code of Conduct \neach include a section on fair competition, which includes  \nclear expectations on how our employees and suppliers  \nshould adhere to all applicable competition laws. We have  \nalso developed a detailed Competition Law Guideline and \nlaunched a mandatory e-learning on Competition Law for our \noffice employees.\nWe have not registered any final court convictions violating \nlabour law and human rights, tax laws, corruption laws, or \nfair competition laws against the Vestas Group or senior \nmanagement, and we have implemented a new approach  \nto tracking court convictions, ensuring compliance with  \nthe T axonomy.\nT axonomy-aligned revenue\n96 percent of our revenue is aligned for 2022. 71 percent of \nthe aligned revenue is related to our manufacturing activities, \nand 25 percent of the aligned revenue is related to our \nconstruction and service activities.\nFor T axonomy reporting, the revenue derived from 1) Supply-\nonly, 2) Supply-and-installation, 3) Engineering, Procurement \nand Construction (“EPC”), and 4) Service contracts (excluding \nSale of spare parts) is split under Activity 3.1 and Activity 7.6. \nThe supply portion of contracts is included under Activity 3.1, \nand the installation portion and other activities included in the \ncontracts are included under Activity 7.6.\nRevenue not T axonomy-aligned\n4 percent of our revenue is eligible but not aligned for 2022. \nBased on our assessment, we cannot conclude that activities \nrelated to the Development business or Sale of spare parts \nare aligned. These activities are currently considered eligible \nunder Activity 7.6. Alignment of these activities is planned \nfor 2023.\n Accounting principles - revenue\nVestas recognises revenue in compliance with IFRS 15, split \ninto two segments: Power Solutions and Service.\nThe Power Solutions segment comprises revenue relating to \nSupply-only, Supply-and-installation, and EPC (Engineering, \nProcurement and Construction) contracts. Revenue from the \nDevelopment business is reported under Supply-only in the \nPower Solutions segment.
