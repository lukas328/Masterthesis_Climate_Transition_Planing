Bupa is the only investor in the issued debt of the entity and is exposed to the risks and rewards \nof the fund. \n(b) Non-controlling interests \nThe Group has no subsidiaries whose non-controlling interest is material on the basis of their share of equity \nor profit or loss. \nNote 24: \nBusiness \ncombinations \nand disposals \nBusiness combinations and disposals in brief \nA business combination refers to the acquisition of a controlling interest \nin a business, which is further defined as an integrated set of activities \nand assets that is capable of being conducted and managed for the \npurpose of providing economic benefits to the owners. A disposal refers \nto the sale of a subsidiary. \nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. Identifiable assets and liabilities acquired \nand contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the \nacquisition date. Any non-controlling interests are recognised as a proportionate share of the acquiree’s net \nidentifiable assets. \nThe identification and valuation of intangible assets arising on business combinations is subject to a degree of \nestimation and judgement. We engage independent third parties to assist with the identification and valuation \nprocess. In valuing these intangible assets, market-accepted methodologies have been applied. Customer \nrelationships are valued using methodologies such as the Multi-Period Excess Earnings Method (where the value \nof an intangible asset is equal to the present value of the after-tax cash ﬂows attributable only to that intangible \nasset). Brands and trademarks are valued using methodologies such as the Relief from Royalty Method (applying \nan estimated royalty rate to the projected sales relating to each asset over the economic life). \nThe excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable assets acquired \nis recorded as goodwill. \nAcquisition accounting must be completed within 12 months of the transaction date. \nCosts related to the acquisition are expensed as incurred. \n(a) 2022 acquisitions \nDuring the year, the Group made acquisitions for a total consideration of £23m, recognising net assets on \nacquisition of £9m. \nAcquisitions with a total consideration of £13m were made in Poland over the course of the year as the Group \ncontinued to expand its presence in the region. This included the acquisition of Med-Polonia Sp. z.o.o in April 2022 \nfor a consideration of £7m. Total net assets of £4m were recognised in respect of the acquisitions along with \nassociated goodwill of £9m. \nIn addition, in November 2022, the Group acquired Bité Medica Hospital in Mexico for a consideration of £9m. \nNet assets of £5m and resulting goodwill of £4m were recognised on acquisition. \nThere was an adjustment to goodwill and consideration in respect of the prior year Citomed acquisition. \nBoth goodwill acquired and consideration increased by £1m. \nBupa Annual Report 2022 181 \n                  \n                   \n                       \n          \n        \n \n \n   \n     \n     \n     \n    \n     \n    \n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n    \n      \n     \n      \n       \n       \n \n                      \n                    \n                   \n                  \n \n                  \n                 \n \n                \n              \n                  \n                    \n       \n                   \n               \n               \n                  \n                 \n    \n                   \n                     \n                   \n                 \n          \n      \n   \nStrategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements \nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \ncontinued \nIncluded in the Group Consolidated Income Statement is revenue of £5m and a loss before taxation of £1m \nin relation to those businesses acquired in the year.
