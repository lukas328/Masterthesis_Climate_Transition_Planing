This underpins the initial \niteration of our Climate transition plan and identification of further opportunities to support our customers’ transition \nto net zero.\nWe use scenarios that are recognised in the industry and developed by independent and respected organisations \nto assess forward-looking pathways for different sectors. We have followed the SBTi requirement of selecting \nscenarios that are at least as ambitious as those in the SBTi SDA tool. We also tried to use as few scenarios as \npossible to keep the overall picture consistent. However, we had to compromise to keep our sectoral pathways \nambitious and cover various sectors. For each sector, we compared the IEA’s B2DS World scenario against the \nUK CCC’s BNZ scenarios and selected the most ambitious pathway to 2030. We used IEA NZE for oil and gas \n(Scope 3 emissions) as it is the only scenario to contain this pathway. However, we did not use it for other sectoral \npathways as it is less ambitious for most of the sectors. We will continue to assess updates in scenarios as these \nare published and incorporated in methodologies, including SBTi.\nThe main assumptions of the scenarios used for each sector and their potential impacts on emissions are noted \non pages 82-87 and were discussed in more detail in our 2021 Climate-related Disclosures Report. Updates on \npolicy assumptions were assessed as part of our work on developing the initial iteration of our Climate transition \nplan, included in section 3.4. The UK CCC and IEA scenarios have similar assumptions on technology deployment \nand policy support, so this approach enables NatWest Group to consider the impact of its financing and further \nsupport we can provide to customers to support their transition to net zero. \nFor estimating physical emissions intensity reductions required by 2030 we used different scenarios than for \nour internal scenario analysis, which is based on the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening \nthe Financial System (NGFS) scenarios. Although NGFS produced scenarios which satisfy the ‘well below 2°C’ \nrequirement of the Paris Agreement (e.g. Net Zero 2050 scenario), they do not contain enough sectoral detail \nto set sectoral decarbonisation targets and support our work on financed emissions. However, since they have \na similar end-of-century temperature target, our sectoral pathways could be considered broadly consistent with \nthe Net Zero 2050 scenario used for our scenario analysis work.\nOur internal climate scenario analysis, carried out to support participation in the CBES exercise allowed us to \nassess our exposure to climate-related risks across our lending and debt securities book, using NGFS produced \nscenarios which satisfy the `well below 2°C’ requirement of the Paris Agreement. The outcome from our internal \nscenario analysis was included in the assessment of heightened climate-related risk sectors which has informed our \nwork on the analysis of financed emissions as well as developing the initial iteration of our Climate transition plan. \nWe have continued to build our measurement capabilities to support the assessment of climate-related risks and \nopportunities within NatWest Group’s loans and investments using external scenarios aligned with the 2015 Paris \nAgreement. We have set sector targets validated by the SBTi as science based for 79% of our lending book as at \n31 December 2019 and 57% of debt securities and equity shares, excluding sovereign debt securities. As noted on \nthe following page, the 2030 targets, validated by the SBTi, are based on external scenarios including the UK CCC \nBNZ scenario as well as the IEA B2DS scenario.\nMethodologies, standards and standard setters\nThe table below summarises the various collaborations and guidance NatWest Group has used to develop \nmethodologies for estimating financed emissions:\nOrganisation Use in NatWest Group methodology \nPartnership for Carbon \nAccounting Financials \n(PCAF)\nWhere available, NatWest Group uses methodologies in the PCAF Standard \nfor Financed Emissions first published in November 2020. In addition, we \nhave used PCAF data quality and disclosure principles to guide our work. \nThe second edition of the PCAF Standard for Financed Emissions was \npublished in December 2022. Our approach continues to be guided by the \nPCAF Standard and we will incorporate the latest updates during 2023.\nScience Based Targets \ninitiative (SBTi)\nNatWest Group joined SBTi following the launch of financial sector science-\nbased targets guidance in 2020. We have used their Sectoral Decarbonisation \nApproach (SDA), where available, to assess initial emissions intensity \nestimates for 2030, for certain sectors. We have also followed SBTi \nand PCAF guidance where possible to choose the most appropriate \nemissions intensity metrics. During 2022, we published our 2030 sector \ntargets validated by the SBTi as science-based.\nClimate Change Committee \n(CCC)\nThe CCC published the Sixth Carbon Budget, the UK’s path to net zero in \nDecember 2020. As a largely UK-focused bank, we selected the UK CCC’s \n‘Balanced net zero’ pathway to determine emission reductions required \nby 2030, where possible. In developing the initial iteration of our Climate \ntransition plan, we have used the UK CCC’s Progress in reducing emissions: \n2022 Report to Parliament as the basis of assessing current status of \ngovernment policies.\nThe International Energy \nAgency (IEA)\nWe have used the IEA Beyond 2°C World Scenario (B2DS World) from \nthe Energy Technology Perspectives (ETP) report for assessing estimates \nfor emissions reduction by 2030 for sectors where the B2DS World scenario \nwas more ambitious that the UK CCC’s BNZ scenario\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
