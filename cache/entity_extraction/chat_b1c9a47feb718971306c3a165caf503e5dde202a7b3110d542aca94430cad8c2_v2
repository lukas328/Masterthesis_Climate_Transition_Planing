While the \nCommittee retain oversight reward is managed locally, \nwith benchmarking conducted on a regular basis to \nensure that our overall reward package remains in \nline with relevant local market practice. \nThe Committee regularly and carefully considers wider \nemployee pay and broader remuneration initiatives, \nas context for the decisions it makes. We know this \nis a challenging time for our employees due to rising \ninflation and the increased cost of living. Bupa has \nthree NEDs who act as the designated NED for \ndifferent areas of the business and details on the \nactivities undertaken in the year are set out in the \nCorporate Governance Report. \nPerformance and pay in 2022 \nSalary \nIn 2022, the Committee approved increases of 1.9% \nfor the Group CEO and 2.0% for the Group CFO. \nManagement Bonus Scheme \nThe Management Bonus Scheme is the Group’s annual \nbonus plan applying to leaders and managers across \nBupa. 50% of the payout for Executive Directors is \ndeferred for three years. \nPerformance of Group profit was favourable to plan due \nto higher profits across the Market Units, with volume \ngrowth across the insurance portfolio in Australia and \nSanitas, good turnaround performance in Bupa Global, \nand volume growth and lower claims in UK Insurance, \npartly offset by challenges in aged care and \nprovisioning in UK, and lower volumes in Hong Kong. \nRevenue and cost efficiency were both above target. \nThe Committee applied the following adjustments in \ndetermining the annual MBS outcomes: \n▪ As a result of our commitment to not benefit from \nCOVID-19 in our Australian health insurance business, \nit was agreed that any returns to customers should be \nadjusted for. These returns, which take the form of a \ncash rebate, deferred premium rises or other similar \napproaches, totalled £166.97m and were removed \nfrom the revenue target. \n▪ Related to this commitment, £66m of undistributed \nAustralian health insurance claims savings related \nto COVID-19 were removed. \n▪ The other area which the Committee considered this \nyear was the impact on statutory profit of the \nimpairment of intangible assets and goodwill arising \non business combinations. The Committee carefully \nreviewed the factors leading to this impairment and \nthe extent to which this should impact incentive \npayments for past and current executives. The view \nof the Committee was that the current executive \nteam were not responsible for the material factors \nleading to the impairment and should therefore not \nbe penalised for the statutory loss; no additional \nadjustment would be applied to any former executive \nteam member. \nAll Market Units continued to make good progress on \ncustomer performance metrics, an outcome of Bupa’s \ncustomer-centric strategy resulting in a high level of \noperational and transformative focus on delivery for \ncustomers across the Group. \nAlongside the measures that make up the MBS \nscorecard, the MBS outcome is subject to an overall \nadjustment relating to risk management behaviours. \nAssisted by contributions from the Risk Committee \nand the Risk Review Panel, the Committee determined \nthat no business-wide risk adjustments would apply. \nThe IPMs for the Group CEO and Group CFO, based on \ntheir performance during the year, were 150% and 130% \nrespectively. As a result, the Committee approved \nbonuses of 89.2% and 77.4% of maximum opportunity \nfor the Group CEO and Group CFO respectively. \nCommittee evaluation \nDuring the year, an external evaluation of the \neffectiveness of the Committee was conducted as \npart of the wider review of the Board and Board \nCommittees. The review found that the Committee \nfunctioned effectively. \nIn 2023 the Committee will continue to focus on \nmonitoring wider employee pay and considerations \nfrom broader Board discussions on inclusion and \ndiversity and pay differences (e.g. gender pay gap). \nVoting on remuneration \nOur Remuneration Policy was approved at the 2022 \nAGM and remains unchanged. We are committed to \nbeing open and transparent with our AMs and, as usual, \nour Directors’ remuneration report will also be tabled \nfor an advisory vote at the 2023 AGM. \nCath Keers \nCommittee Chair \nBupa Annual Report 2022 83 \n        \n                \n               \n            \n                 \n               \n          \n            \n             \n                \n \n            \n            \n            \n            \n      \n             \n             \n   \n            \n             \n             \n            \n            \n              \n       \n                  \n            \n \n          \n                \n             \n     \n                \n                    \n                   \n                   \n                 \n                \n  \n \n     \n          \n         \n          \n          \n          \n                      \n          \n  \n     \n   \nStrategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements \nDirectors’ remuneration report \nPart 1: Committee Chair’s letter continued \nAlignment with Provision 40 of the Corporate Governance Code \nThe Committee is mindful of the UK Corporate Governance Code’s six principles when it determines remuneration \npolicy.
