Embedding Climate Risk3. Delivering on our pledges 5. Using our influence\nCONTENTS  |  FINANCIAL INSTITUTION NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLANS — FUNDAMENTALS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND GUIDANCE\n36\nFOUNDATIONS\nAdditionally, the Climate Transition Plan connects Aviva’s objectives to targets and actions. The company explains \nits current and future activities to achieve net zero for Scopes 1, 2, and 3 emissions by 2040; reach net zero in its \noperations by 2030; and increase its sustainable investments. For each objective, Aviva sets out actions and levers \nto implement. It also discusses complementary objectives related to the highest carbon-emitting sectors; supporting \npeople as the economy changes (relating to a just transition); the dependencies and impact on biodiversity and \nthe influence it can bring to bear on various actors who help shape global economies and financial markets; and \nplanning its future carbon-removal offsets (negative emissions).\nGFANZ guidance is that financial institutions should articulate how their plan will be embedded within the wider \norganization. Aviva states, “To deliver this plan will require action on our investments and underwriting, which \nbetween them account for around 90% of our current emissions, alongside how we run and operate our business.” \nThe company explains how it will deliver on its pledges, and how it is organizing efforts into five functional streams: \nInvestments, Internal Operations, Supply Chain, General Insurance Underwriting, and Claims Management. The plan \nalso touches on governance and long-term incentive plans, demonstrating the considerations taken in developing \nthe transition plan.\nAviva signals that this is the first release of its plan, and it will refresh and strengthen its plan over time. For the \nsector, Aviva considers that many pieces of the puzzle are still missing: The data is imperfect; methodologies are \nincomplete. These will evolve over time; however, Aviva believed it could no longer wait for everything to be neatly \nlaid out before it developed and started to implement a plan.\n \nExample 2. Robeco’s ambition and roadmap\nSub-sector: Asset  Management\nRobeco, an international asset manager owned by Japan’s ORIX Corporation, produced its Net Zero Roadmap89 \nin October 2021, which communicates the company’s commitment and plan. In addition to setting out Robeco’s \ninterim targets, the roadmap document contains a clear commitment statement, which includes two of GFANZ’s \nrecommended elements: scope and timing. \n“Our commitment: Robeco is committed to achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions across all its assets \nunder management by 2050. We commit to this goal because it’s part of our responsible stewardship and because \nwe are convinced it’s in the long-term interest of our clients and our investment performance. Our vision is that \nsafeguarding economic, environmental and social assets is a prerequisite for a healthy economy and the generation  \nof attractive returns in the future.”\nAn infographic lays out the company’s baseline emissions for investment portfolios and operational emissions \n(2019), interim GHG emissions reduction targets for 2025 and 2030, and key actions to be taken to achieve the \nreductions. \nThe document then describes each of the six key actions, articulating how the overall ambition links to the \nimplementation of the transition plan.\n89 Robeco.
