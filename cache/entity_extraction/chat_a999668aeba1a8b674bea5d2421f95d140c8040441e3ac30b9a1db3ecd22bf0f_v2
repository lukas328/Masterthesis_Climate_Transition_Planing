We aimed to get a \nsense of management’s risk tolerance and understand the policies and \nstructures in place to keep this in check.\nOutcome\n \nOur engagement helped us to conclude that the conservative nature \nof P3’s funding, and the scale of its investments and growth targets, \nalongside its solid corporate governance foundations, help mitigate \nsome of the inherent risks of an acquisition-led growth strategy in \nreal estate. Although P3 is privately owned, which can decrease \nthe standard of corporate governance, GIC (Sovereign Wealth \nFund of Singapore) is the main shareholder and is in the process of \nbuilding the business in a more conservative manner than sponsor-\nowned peers. Reassuring attributes include that P3 has replicated \na public governance board structure, with a two-tiered board. Half \nof the advisory board is independent, and the chairs of the audit \nand remuneration committees are also independent. In addition, the \ncompany has decreased the complexity of the capital structure over \nthe last two years. \nGovernance\nSustainability and Stewardship Report\n42\nWe may collaborate with other investors as part of an engagement strategy \nif it can contribute to achieving our engagement objectives.\nCase study:\nClimate Action 100+ (“CA100+”)\nOver the year we continued as the co-lead engagers for Eskom and Sasol through CA100+, \nand as a working group participant for ExxonMobil.

Since 2022, there has been a 20% increase in disclosure on climate \nchange, water and forests, with 317 new companies disclosing after engagement \nby the 288 financial institutions that support the campaign.\nNinety One led on 22 company engagements, of which 13 focused on climate. Of \nthe companies that have disclosed to CDP since engagement, Tiger Brands stands \nout. We have led on the engagement with the South African food and beverage \ncompany since 2021 and were pleased to see it take an important step forward on \nclimate change disclosure. We will continue contributing to this campaign in 2024.\nCase study:\nVitesco Technologies: challenging on offer price\nObjective Ninety One’s Value team engaged with the board of vehicle component \nmanufacturer Vitesco Technologies after majority owner Schaeffler made a \ntender offer for the company in October 2023. We were concerned that the \noffer price significantly undervalued Vitesco and initially spoke to the company to \nexpress our view that this offer was too low. However, as minority shareholders, \nwe were worried that we would be disadvantaged and took the decision to write \na public letter to escalate the engagement, with the aim of clearly highlighting our \nconcerns, both to the company and to the acquirer Schaeffler. \nOutcome\n \nAt the end of November 2023, Schaeffler increased its tender offer by €3 to \n€94 per share. This new price was still below our assessment of fair value, but \nthe high percentage ownership by the Schaeffler group meant that it likely would \nhave been able to complete the purchase with or without management support. \nWhile the management team did push back against the price, it went ahead with \nthe merger to be able to preserve Vitesco’s electrification capabilities within an \nenlarged Schaeffler, which would not have happened following a more hostile \nresponse. \nCollaborative\nEngagement escalation\nEquities\n44\nSustainability and Stewardship Report\nOur proxy \nvoting approach\nWe regard proxy voting as a means to bring about change, as well \nas being a fundamental right of shareholders.
