It consists broadly of four pillars to help clients \ndecarbonize their portfolios, which can all be sub-targets: reduce carbon intensity, invest in climate leaders, \nsupport climate solutions, and influence change. 21 \n \nAllianzGI offers climate thematic and impact-driven opportunities such as green bonds and climate \ntransition equity and private markets renewable energy investments. These specialized assets can help to \nalign an asset owner’s portfolio with climate transition targets.22  \n \nFurther information on the offerings of our asset managers can be accessed here: our approach to \nsustainable investing (allianzgi.com) and ESG at PIMCO (pimco.com).  \n \n \n19 For the avoidance of doubt, this Inaugural Transition Plan applies only for Allianz’s proprietary investments, not for third-party \nassets  \n20 Environmental, social, and good governance. \n21 For more details see PIMCO ESG Investing (ESG Investing Report | PIMCO). \n22 For more details see AllianzGI Sustainability and Stewardship Report 2022 (Sustainability and Stewardship Report 2022 | AllianzGI). \nTable 3: New 2030 Targets for Property & Casualty Insurance \n \n \n \n 8/8 \n \n4. Operations \n \nFor our own operations we are already committed to net-zero GHG emissions by 2030. The main \noperations in scope are Travel and Fleet, Procurement, Facility Management, and IT.  \n \nTo this end, we target to reduce GHG emissions arising from Allianz sites and operational activities in over \n70 markets to net-zero by 2030, earlier than 2050 as originally planned. We have accelerated our climate \ntargets for our own operations and by 2025 plan to reduce GHG emissions per employee by 50% versus a \n2019 baseline across Scope 1, Scope 2, and relevant Scope 3 emissions (currently energy-related emissions, \nbusiness travel, and paper use). For year-end 2030, we target GHG emission reductions of 70% and for \nyear-end 2029, -65%.23 \n \nKey drivers will be sourcing 100% renewable electricity by 2023, implementing energy efficiency and \nreduction measures in heating and cooling, shifting to a fully electric corporate car fleet by 2030 at the \nlatest, covered by a commitment to EV100 with the Climate Group, and achieving a 40% reduction of GHG \nemissions from travel activities by 2025 against a 2019 baseline. To address the remaining 30% of the \nemissions, we will use high-quality carbon removal solutions.  \n \nBeyond our own operations, we will ask 100% of global framework vendors in our supply chain that \nprovide services globally to establish a public commitment to net-zero GHG emissions in line with the 1.5°C \npath by 2025. \nD Call to action to governments \nHowever, further action is needed from national governments in order to close the still wide ambition gap, \nincluding setting nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and country pathways in line with 1.5°C. \nFor the long-term success of our global economy and society, the actions of businesses and financial \ninstitutions that have set 1.5°C-aligning net-zero commitments need to be matched by governments and \nregulators. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n23 Target year 2030 is always defined as using year-end 2029 values for investment and P&C targets. For own operations and for \nreporting purposes, we will be moving our year-end 2030 timeline one year forward to year-end 2029 to align with reporting cut-off \ndates for proprietary investments and P&C insurance. -70% target is based on end 2030. A pro-rata calculation at the end-2029 would \ncorrespond to -65%. The strategy review for own operations is currently ongoing and will be updated accordingly in 2024.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
