     \n   \n   \nStrategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements \nSustainability and ESG continued \nBroader ESG action \nWhile our sustainability strategy focuses our action on \nthe three Mission pillars outlined above, we recognise \nthe importance of strong foundational performance on \nwider ESG topics to underpin this focused action. The \nspecific ESG topics covered in the section below are: \n(i) responsible investment; (ii) sustainable procurement; \n(iii) gender pay gap; (iv) business ethics and (v) an \noverview of our sustainability and ESG disclosures. \nResponsible investment \nWe believe ESG factors present both risks to the long-\nterm performance of our financial investments, and \nopportunities to improve the impact of the investments \non society and the environment. We aim to invest in a \nresponsible manner which is aligned with our purpose, \nstrategy and climate ambitions. Our investment \nportfolio is largely invested in cash and deposits, but \nwith an allocation to bonds and loans managed by third \nparties. We ensure that our sustainability strategy and \nESG factors are incorporated in all investment decision-\nmaking and prohibit investments in certain sectors \n(including coal, tar sands, tobacco and controversial \nweapons)1, and also place exposure limits on the sectors \nand countries most at risk from climate change. We \nhave set targets, including a 1.5°C by 2040 temperature \nalignment target validated by the Science Based Target \ninitiative (SBTi), to reduce the GHG emissions of our \ninvestments, and we are taking action to achieve \nemissions reduction while helping to finance the \ntransition to a low carbon economy. \nWe are a signatory to the UN Principles for Responsible \nInvestment (PRI), and members of the Institutional \nInvestors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC) and \nthe UK Sustainable Investment Forum (UK SIF). \nFor more information please see our Responsible \nInvestment page on Bupa.com here. \n1. If revenues generated from these activities exceed 5% of total revenues \nfor the company. \nSustainable procurement \nAs mentioned in the Mission Zero section, most of \nour GHG emissions are in our value chain. That’s why in \n2022 we have focused on establishing our procurement \nsustainability programme to work with our suppliers to \ndrive down our scope 3 emissions and innovate lower \ncarbon products and services. The following was \ndelivered in 2022. \n1. A global approach for procurement, which includes: \n▪ Agreed targets and ambitions to support \nMission Zero. \n▪ Enhanced ESG risk assessment for new/ \nchanged service. \n▪ Inclusion of ESG due diligence in supplier onboarding. \n▪ A strategic and collaborative approach, across \nall procurement categories, to meeting our \nprocurement targets. \nWe have begun supplier engagement to understand \ntheir: (i) sustainability strategy ambitions; (ii) key \ntargets (carbon, waste, water); (iii) external target \nsetting (SBTi) and (iv) Inclusion and Diversity approach, \nand to test Bupa's supply chain maturity regarding net \nzero and ESG. \nThis information helped develop focused objectives \nfor 2023, enabling education for less mature suppliers, \nand collaboration with the more mature suppliers. By \nembracing both approaches, Bupa will successfully \nprogress against our targets, but most importantly, \ninfluence our supply chain to continually improve -\nin line with Bupa’s sustainability strategy ambitions. \n2. A refined Responsible Supply Chain Statement which \noutlines the minimum standards that we expect from \nour suppliers across a range of ESG and Responsible \nBusiness Conduct metrics. \nIn 2022, we further refined the requirements needed \nto deliver our sustainability commitments – a robust \nprogramme of ESG focus, enhancement and \nchange. This ensures that our supply chain is aware \nof our updated expectations to allow us to work \ntogether successfully. \nThe changes within the statement\n######################\nOutput:", "role":
