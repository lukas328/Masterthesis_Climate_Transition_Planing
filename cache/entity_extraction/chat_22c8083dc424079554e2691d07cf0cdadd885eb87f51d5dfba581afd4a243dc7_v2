stakeholders, as \nwell as keeping day-to-day contact with customers and holding \nannual events such as our Supplier Forum � \nSupplier engagement\nEvery year we host the Supplier Forum where we engage with our \nmost critical suppliers and share expectations for the future \ndevelopment of the renewable energy industry � The Supplier Forum \ncreates a platform to share business perspectives and expectations \nwith our suppliers who represent a large pool of resources and \nnetworks � We want to connect those resources into partnerships \nthrough an integrated ecosystem that makes our business and \nindustry stronger � \nDeveloping a sustainable supply base is essential to make long-term \nprogress on our sustainability commitments � To enable these \npartnerships and build the foundation for the ecosystem, we must \nmature collaboration with our key partners and facilitate connec -\ntions among our partners � \nThe theme of this year’s Supplier Forum was “competitiveness”, \nincluding staying competitive while meeting sustainability require -\nments� A key message was “Sustainability is the new digital arena �” \nTransparent and quality ESG data is a prerequisite to a successful \npartnership with Vestas �\nDuring the event, awards were presented to suppliers that excelled \nin critical areas, including sustainability � This year our supplier \nSchaeffler was presented with the sustainability award � They won \nbased on four criteria:\n• Ambitious sustainability strategy including 100% renewable \nelectricity consumption by 2024, and clear carbon neutrality \ntargets\n• Green steel partnership engagement with potential for significant \nCO2e reductions \n• Pioneering initiatives to reduce carbon-based fuels in production\n• Demonstration of organisational sustainability embedded \nthrough initiatives such as ‘climate action day’\n←\nThe 2022 Vestas Sustainable Supplier \naward was granted to Schaeffler.\n24\nVestas Sustainability Report 2022\nGeneralIn brief GovernanceEnvironment Sustainability dataSocial Appendix\nHow we utilise data to accelerate sustainability\nFollowing the Supplier Forum, we conducted three sustainability \nwebinar sessions, with the purpose of building capacity and working \nwith our critical suppliers towards a sustainable supply base � The \nsessions aimed to convey our sustainability strategy and activities \nto mitigate the environmental and social impacts of our supply  \nchain operations � \nESG data digitalisation\nTo enable the achievement of our ambitious sustainability goals,  \nwe invested in a sustainability data platform that uses digital twin \ntechnology to calculate real-time climate footprints and run \nscenarios that support in monitoring, forecasting, optimisation, and \ntarget achievement � Our supply chain emissions (scope 3) account \nfor approximately 98 percent of our total emissions � Therefore, \nleveraging emissions and waste data from our value chain is crucial \nfor our decarbonisation journey � \nAfter going live in 2022, the sustainability data platform allows our \nsuppliers to report their emissions and enables us to calculate the \nreal-time environmental footprint and scenarios � This provides \nreadily available data for monitoring, forecasting, and optimizing \nsustainability performance for Vestas � We believe having the right \ninformation is key to efficient decision-making � Using supplier-spe -\ncific data rather than industry averages equips us to fully under -\nstand the climate-related impact of our supply chain with greater \naccuracy, consistency, and transparency � The platform enables us to \nmap impacts throughout the value chain and to prioritise collabora -\ntion with suppliers who are working to reduce the emissions \nintensity of their products and materials �\nTwenty-one of our strategic suppliers were onboarded and deliv- \nered emissions data through the software by the end of 2022 �  \nOur suppliers benefit by being able to track their year-on year \nemission reduction progress and, in dialogue with us, explore \nreduction opportunities � \nThe platform will undergo continuous improvement and deve- \nlopment in the coming years as we continue to onboard additio- \nnal suppliers �\nScenarios and  \noptimisation\nTarget achievement  \nand monitoring \nSoftware InterfaceForecasting\nThe Digital Twin\nSystems\nMaster data from our \nexisting systems is sent \nto the Digital Twin\nUsers\nData inputs from our \nsustainability specialists \nand suppliers can

demand\nOur approach\nOur impact\nWe aim to meet or exceed environmental standards and ensure \nenvironmental protection as a pre-requisite of doing business � \nAlthough our technology majorly contributes to the green energy\ntransition, we recognize that our products can have negative\nenvironmental impacts � Our QHSE policy outlines our commitment \nto mitigating these impacts, and we work closely with our\nsuppliers and customers to enhance the environmental perfor -\nmance of our solutions across a broad range of issues � \nOur plans to ensure that our business model and strategy is \ncompatible with the highest environmental standards and a \ntransition to a climate-neutral economy requires engagement \nfrom many stakeholders in our value chain � This includes our \ntargets and action plans to address material climate related \nimpacts, risks, and opportunities � \nOur technology is a key enabler of the green energy transition\nMitigating global climate change by accelerating the green energy \ntransition is our greatest positive sustainability impact and core to \nour purpose as a business � Our fleet of turbines already avoids a \nmassive sum of carbon
