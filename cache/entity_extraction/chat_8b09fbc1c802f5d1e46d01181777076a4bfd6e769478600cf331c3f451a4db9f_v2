We also considered the financed emissions rate for the subsector.\n • This approach identified 44 subsectors exposed to heightened climate-related risk, increasing to 47 \nwithin 17 wholesale sectors, following a qualitative overlay applied by internal subject matter experts.\n • The development of this enhanced, granular view of climate-related risk exposure at subsector level \ncreates potential for more robust consideration of climate-related risk during customer decisioning \nprocesses.\n • Note, underlying exposures for leveraged funds and securitisations are generally diversified, and as \nsuch we look to manage any climate-related risks at client level, rather than classifying entire sectors \nas exposed to heightened climate-related risk. In addition, securitisations are primarily managed as \nan asset class within NatWest Group, rather than via sector frameworks. As a result, leveraged fund \nand securitisations were excluded from our assessment.\n • See section 5.1 for further details of lending exposure to sectors and subsectors identified as \nheightened.\nWe use climate risk scorecards to provide a consistent and structured approach for \nassessing customer-specific exposure to climate-related risks.\n • Having launched initial qualitative climate risk scorecards in 2021, during 2022 we rolled out \nadditional scorecards across the wholesale portfolio aligned to underlying PD models. Qualitative \nscorecards now cover approximately 90% of the wholesale Exposure at Default(1).\n • The insights generated by the qualitative scorecards allow us to better assess climate-related risks and \npotential opportunities to support transition, at both a wholesale portfolio and individual wholesale \ncustomer level. To support this, a visualisation tool for use by colleagues in interpreting the scorecard \ndata outputs has been developed in 2022. This is the starting point to allow us to identify, assess and \nmanage climate-related risk and to provide the right support to customers. While current capabilities \ndo not yet impact internal ratings based (IRB) credit metrics, this capability development is part of a \nmulti-year journey to mature our approach to climate risk management.\n • In parallel with the roll-out of qualitative climate risk scorecards, over 2022 the Group has started to \ndevelop a more quantitative and automated climate risk scorecard methodology. This approach \ntakes the insights from the development and implementation of the initial suite of scorecards and builds \nupon this by making better use of existing climate risk analytics capabilities e.g., climate risk scenario \nanalysis.\n • The outputs continue to be a relative, rather than absolute, measure of physical and transition risk. The \nmethodology intends to separately assesses the inherent level of climate-related risk a customer may \nface and considers their ability to mitigate and adapt. For example, the design of the climate risk \nscorecard looks to incorporate the outputs of the Customer Transition Plan Assessment to assess \ntransition risk mitigation - see section 3.6. \n • From 2023 NatWest Group will start to expand the methodology across the majority of the wholesale \nportfolio and once fully developed, we aim for it to be used within credit decisioning.\nWe periodically assess the exposure of the Retail Banking mortgage portfolio to both \ntransition and physical climate-related risks\n • Throughout the year we have monitored EPC ratings and the insurance risk of properties we finance \nseparately for owner occupied and buy-to-let properties, as well as for new business and overall \ncumulative mortgage lending.\n • We have used the outputs of scenario analysis – see section 4.2a, along with regulatory feedback to \nevaluate the data monitored to identify trends and assess the need for further mitigating actions.\n • Through engaging with external commercial suppliers, we have enhanced our data using digital EPCs \nand are assessing the use of this data for use where EPC data has not been gathered, either through \nnew business with customers or from the government EPC register. \nWe have conducted sustainability assessments on our suppliers\n • The NatWest Group Supplier Charter sets out our aims and expectations against core ESG pillars, \nincluding climate. The charter is covered in our tender process and is a standing agenda item at \nsupplier meetings and as part of ongoing contract management.\n • Carbon emissions within our supply chain present a risk to NatWest Group meeting its climate \ncommitments, and equally, decarbonisation has the potential to reduce supply chain exposure to \ntransition risks meaning suppliers remain competitive and resilient. Details of how we monitor this can \nbe found in section 5.4.\n • To manage the risk, we are initiating work to understand supplier capability to transition to net zero \nand identify where support is required to progress. This forms part of a multi-year journey working in \npartnership with our suppliers. This will include providing resources to help build the capability they \nneed to measure and report their own emissions. This data will enable us to monitor the climate impact \nof our own operational value chain, and to identify any vulnerabilities in our supply chain which could \nimpact resilience and our net zero ambition.\n(1) Excludes Sovereign exposure, where we apply the Country Climate Change Vulnerability Index to assess the level of climate risk, and Central Items relating to liquidity management activities.\n57NatWest Group plc | 2022 Climate-related Disclosures Report\nGovernance Strategy and Climate transition plan Risk Management and Scenario Analysis Metrics and TargetsIntroduction\nClimate scenario analysis is a critical tool to support the identification of climate-related \nopportunities, management of climate-related risks and understanding of the impact that climate \nchange could have on NatWest Group, the wider economy and society.\nmodelling the impacts of climate-related risk.
