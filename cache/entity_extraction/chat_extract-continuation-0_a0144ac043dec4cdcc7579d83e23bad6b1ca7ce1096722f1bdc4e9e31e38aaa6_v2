\nRisk Committee report \nThe Committee’s role and governance \nThe principal role of the Committee is to assist \nthe Board in articulating and developing its risk \nmanagement strategy and providing oversight of \nrisk across Bupa. This includes understanding current \nand future risk exposures, recommending overall risk \nappetite to the Board, reviewing the consistency of \ncorporate strategy with the Company’s risk appetite, \nreviewing the RMF, considering the risk aspects of \nmajor transactions, and promoting a risk-aware culture \nthroughout Bupa. A full description of the Committee’s \nrole is set out in its Terms of Reference which are \navailable here on bupa.com. A detailed description of \nthe principal risks to Bupa’s business is set out in the \nRisk section on page 42, and the Group’s approach to, \nand implementation of, risk management systems and \ncontrols is set out in the System of governance \nsection on page 63. \nThe Committee members are all independent NEDs \nwhose collective experience and knowledge ensures \nthat the Committee can provide the Board with ongoing \nrisk management oversight and advice on strategic risk \nmatters. Paul Evans, Sally Clark and I bring additional \ntechnical experience from our extensive backgrounds in \nthe accountancy, internal audit, insurance and financial \nservices sectors, and Paul is also a Non-Executive \nDirector on the boards of Bupa’s UK insurance business. \nMatías Rodríguez Inciarte has similar experience and is \nalso a Non-Executive Director of the Group’s Spanish \ninsurance business. Through Matías and Paul, the \nCommittee therefore has direct insight into two of our \nkey markets. Professor Melvin Samsom has an extensive \nmedical background, which is especially relevant when \nconsidering clinical risks, while his recent experience in \nSaudi Arabia offers insight into one of Bupa’s growth \nmarkets. Gunjan Bhow joined the Committee during \nthe year and the Committee has benefited from his \nexperience in risks related to digital transformation and \ndata. The Group CEO, Group CFO, CRO, CMO, CAO and \nthe lead partner of the External Auditor are invited to \nattend all meetings. The CRO has unrestricted access \nto all members of the Committee and has regular \nprivate meetings with the Committee, in the absence \nof management, to ensure that there is an opportunity \nfor the CRO to raise any concerns he may have. I am \nalso a member of the Remuneration Committee and \nam therefore able to assist with ensuring that risk \nmanagement and culture are a factor in \nremuneration decisions. \nKey activities in 2022 \nDifferent risks pose a higher or lower threat to the \nperformance and longer-term sustainability of our \nbusiness at different times and the Committee adapts \nits focus accordingly to ensure that new and emerging \nrisks are identified, that the profile of existing risks is \nmonitored, and that appropriate mitigating actions are \ntaken by management. The Group’s risk profile has been \nheightened in 2022 due to the impact of current global \neconomic conditions, in particular: high inflation, \nworkforce pressures, and the situation in Chile affecting \nthe Isapre sector (as summarised on page 11). See the \nRisk section on page 42 for details of the principal risks \nto the Group. \nRisks to the 3x6 strategy \nThe Committee has closely monitored the risks to the \nexecution and achievement of our 3x6 strategy to \nensure that change happens within a suitable control \nframework. Areas of focus during 2022 have included: \n▪ the risk that short-term challenges and goals reduce \nthe focus on, and investment in, transformation and \nbuilding the business of the future \n▪ the risk of not changing or not taking opportunities \n▪ potential capability gaps in certain key strategic areas \n▪ the actual and potential future impact of high \ninflation on the achievement of strategic and \nperformance objectives \n▪ failing to achieve our sustainability strategy \nCertain risk elements are also driving some specific \nstrategic performance challenges, most notably \nincreased workforce pressures, information security, \nand regulatory or ‘stroke of pen’ risk in many of our \nmajor markets. Regulatory and judicial risks have \ncrystallised in Chile, as discussed below. \nPeople risks \nPeople are the driving force of our business and so \nthe current global challenges around skills shortages, \nwage inflation, market uncertainty and the impact of \nthe rising cost of living (both generally and on mental \nhealth and wellbeing specifically) have heightened our \npeople risks and impacted our ability to attract and \nretain employees. Bupa is committed to retaining and \ndeveloping our people. The Committee is satisfied that \nmanagement’s actions, such as setting new global pay \nprinciples, committing to providing healthcare to all \nemployees globally, and recruitment and training \ninitiatives (particularly in our aged care services and \ndental businesses), are mitigating these risks to an \nacceptable level. \nChile judicial and\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BUPA<|><organization<|>Bupa is a global healthcare group providing health insurance, aged care, dental services, and other healthcare solutions.
