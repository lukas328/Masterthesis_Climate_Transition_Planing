We will provide a live webcast \nand telephone conference so shareholders can also participate virtually and ask questions in real time. Details on how to join are included in the Notice of AGM. In the Notice, \nwe propose separate resolutions on each substantially separate issue. For each resolution, shareholders may direct their proxy to vote either for or against or to withhold their vote. \nA ‘vote withheld’ is not legally a vote and will not be counted in the calculation of the proportion of the votes cast. All AGM resolutions are decided with an electronic poll, with the \nresults announced as soon as possible and posted on our website. This poll will show votes for and against, as well as votes withheld.\nAuthority to purchase \nown shares\nAt the 2022 AGM, shareholders authorised Johnson Matthey Plc to make market purchases of up to 18,312,226 ordinary shares of 110 49/53 pence each, representing 10% of the then \nissued share capital of the company (excluding treasury shares). Any shares so purchased by Johnson Matthey may be cancelled or held as treasury shares. This authority will cease \nat the conclusion of the 2023 AGM, and shareholders will be asked to give a similar authority at the AGM.\nThere were no share allotments during the year.\nRights and obligations \nattaching to shares\nThe rights and obligations attaching to the ordinary shares in Johnson Matthey Plc are set out in the Articles.\nAs at 31st March 2023, and as at the date of approval of this Annual Report, there were no restrictions on the transfer of ordinary shares in the Company, no limitations on the holding \nof securities and no requirements to obtain the approval of the Company, or of other holders of securities in Johnson Matthey Plc, for a transfer of securities – except as referred \nto below. The directors may, in certain circumstances, refuse to register the transfer of a share in certificated form that is not fully paid up, where the instrument of transfer does \nnot comply with the requirements of the Company’s Articles, or if entitled under the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001. As at 31st March 2023 and as at the date of approval  \nof this report:\n• No person held securities in Johnson Matthey Plc carrying any special rights with regard to control of the Company\n• There were no restrictions on voting rights (including any limitations on voting rights of holders of a given percentage or number of votes or deadlines for exercising voting rights), \nexcept that a shareholder can only vote in respect of a share if it is fully paid\n• There were no arrangements by which, with the Company’s cooperation, financial rights carried by shares in the Company are held by a person other than the holder of the shares\n• There were no agreements known to the Company between holders of securities that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or on voting rights.\nNominees, financial assistance \nand liens\nDuring the year:\n• No shares in Johnson Matthey Plc were acquired by the Company’s nominee, or by a person with financial assistance from the Company, in either case where the Company has \na beneficial interest in the shares (and no person acquired shares in the Company in any previous financial year in its capacity as the Company’s nominee or with financial assistance \nfrom the Company)\n• The Company did not obtain or hold a lien or other charge over its own shares.\nAllotment of securities for cash \nand placing of equity securities\nDuring the year neither Johnson Matthey Plc or any major subsidiary undertaking of the Company has allotted equity securities for cash. During the year, JM has not participated in any \nequity securities’ placing.\nAmerican Depositary Receipt \nprogramme\nJohnson Matthey has a sponsored Level 1 American Depositary Receipt (ADR) programme, which BNY Mellon administers and for which it acts as Depositary. Each ADR represents two \nordinary Johnson Matthey shares. The ADRs trade on the US over-the-counter market under the symbol JMPLY. When dividends are paid to shareholders, the Depositary converts those \ndividends into US dollars, net of fees and expenses, and distributes the net amount to ADR holders.\nEmployee share schemes At 31st March 2023, 3,211 current and former employees were shareholders in Johnson Matthey Plc through the group’s employee share schemes. Through these schemes, current \nand former employees held 2,773,189 ordinary shares or 1.51% of issued share capital, excluding treasury shares. Also as at 31st March 2023, 2,930,062 ordinary shares had been \nawarded but had not yet vested, under the Company’s long-term incentive plans, to 407 current and former employees.\nShares acquired by employees through JM’s employee share schemes rank equally with the other shares in issue and have no special rights. Voting rights in respect of shares held \nthrough the Company’s employee share schemes are not exercisable directly by employees. However, employees can direct the trustee of the schemes to exercise voting rights on their \nbehalf. The trustee of the Company’s Employee Share Ownership Trust (ESOT) has waived its right to dividends on shares held by the ESOT, which have not yet vested unconditionally \nto employees.\nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 2023130\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION\nDirectors\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
