BBVA is \noffsetting its Scope 1 and 2 emissions, and \npart of Scope 3: waste, emissions from \nbusiness travel and travel of headquarters \nemployees. \nBBVA takes part in the NZBA Offset \nworking group to contribute to the \nspecification of the appropriate use \nof offsets for setting and achieving \ndecarbonization targets of financial \ninstitutions, including the appropriate use \nof offsets from their customers’ emissions.\nP.  37\nBBVA Report on TCFD 2022\nThis English version is a translation of the original in Spanish for information purposes only.
