Groupe BPCE will use \nthe tool for its retail activities to rate customers and their maturity in terms of addressing the climate-related and \nenvironmental challenges of their  sector.\nThe GWF tool is an example of how a major financial institution can embed its net-zero objectives and priorities \ninto its core evaluation and decision-making processes.\n124 WTW. 2020 UK Stewardship Code , 2021.\n125 WTW. Our pledge: Net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 for our discretionary investment portfolios , 2021.\n \nExample 8. How WTW helps clients make key climate decisions\nSub-sector: Investment  Consultant\nWTW is a global investment consultant. Investment consultants can play a vital role in supporting the net-zero \ntransition, acting as a critical link between asset managers and asset owners. Across the services provided, \ninvestment consultants can integrate climate-related criteria into their clients’ decision-making processes.  \nFor asset owners, they can provide strategic advice on investment criteria, asset allocation, and asset manager \nselection, helping them to make decisions that align with their own net-zero commitments. And for asset \nmanagers, they can provide guidance on climate solutions and capabilities, encouraging them, through their  \nrating process, to incorporate net-zero considerations. \nSince making its net-zero commitment in 2021, WTW has already embedded key climate-related considerations \nwithin its two main types of services: 124\n1. Fiduciary (outsourced) investment  services \nTo achieve its net-zero objective,125 WTW uses multiple levers to decarbonize the existing assets in its fiduciary \nportfolios, including changes to risk management and asset allocation, manager selection, index design, \nstewardship, and policy-level engagement. Additionally, it makes new investments in climate solutions, such as \nsustainable agriculture, forestry, and renewable energy.  \n2. Advisory investment services  \nWTW helps its clients make decisions about the risks and opportunities of climate change through a range of \nadvisory services, including helping clients develop climate beliefs, asset allocation, benchmarking, climate scenario \nanalysis, net-zero considerations in manager selection and reporting, plus identifying new climate solutions.  \nIMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY\nCONTENTS  |  FINANCIAL INSTITUTION NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLANS — FUNDAMENTALS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND GUIDANCE\n50\nWTW uses its net-zero reporting framework, which includes Carbon Journey Planning and a Climate Dashboard \nacross both services. 126 The Carbon Journey Planning 127 sets out a pathway of emissions and an annual carbon \nbudget for investment portfolios that is consistent with the net-zero transition. Carbon Journey Planning has \nbeen designed to feed into asset owners’ decision-making when changing asset allocation or awarding new \nasset management mandates. The Climate Dashboard was inspired by the Climate Financial Risk Forum’s data \nand metrics guidance. 128 It incorporates data and metrics across five themes: transition risk, physical risk, carbon \nfootprint, alignment, and climate solutions. It is also supplemented by the reporting of engagement activities. The \nClimate Dashboard has been designed to support WTW’s clients in their decisions on asset allocation, manager \nselection, and performance monitoring, and in helping clients achieve their net-zero commitments.\n126 For example, WTW. Climate  Dashboard .\n127 An example of this in practice for Lloyds Banking Group can be found here .\n128 Climate Financial Risk Forum.

Railpen’s Climate Risk and Net Zero Alignment (CRIANZA) framework and tool \nfor decision-making\nSub-sector: Asset  Management\nRailway Pension Investments Limited (Railpen) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Railways Pension Trustee Company \nLimited, the corporate trustee of the UK’s railway pension schemes (the Trustee). Railpen oversees the day-to-day \noperation of the railway pension schemes and is the investment manager for the schemes.\nIn 2021, a new Risk Governance Framework was introduced, and Railpen also updated its Investment Beliefs \nto explicitly reference climate change. Railpen incorporates assessment of climate risk and net-zero alignment \ninto investment decisions using CRIANZA (Climate Risk And Net Zero Alignment), a proprietary framework and \ndeveloped in-house. CRIANZA, a bottom-up portfolio assessment tool, is used to assess individual companies on \ntheir climate risk and net-zero alignment. \nCRIAN\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NATIXIS CORPORATE & INVESTMENT BANKING<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A division of Natixis that provides corporate and investment banking services, including strategic advisory and financing solutions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANNE-CHRISTINE CHAMPION<|>PERSON<|>Co-Head of Natixis Corporate & Investment Banking, involved in strategic planning and implementation of environmental transition initiatives)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GROUPE BPCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A major French banking group that has developed a strategic plan for 2024 focused on sustainability and climate impact measurement)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GWF (Green Weighting Factor)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A tool used by financial institutions like Groupe BPCE to assess climate impact and transition risks of financing operations, supporting long-term environmental commitments)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WTW<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A global investment consultancy that supports clients in making climate-related investment decisions and achieving net-zero commitments)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RISK GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A framework introduced by Railpen to incorporate climate risk and net-zero alignment into investment decision-making processes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RAILWAYS PENSION SCHEME<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The UK railway pension schemes overseen by Railpen, which manages investments and incorporates climate risk assessment tools like CRIANZA)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RAILPEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A subsidiary of Railways Pension Trustee Company Limited, responsible for managing railway pension scheme investments and assessing climate risks using proprietary frameworks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLIMATE RISK AND NET ZERO ALIGNMENT (CRIANZA)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A proprietary in-house framework developed by Railpen to evaluate companies' climate risks and their alignment with net-zero goals)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATIXIS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A financial institution involved in sustainable finance and environmental transition strategies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GROUPE BPCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A major banking group implementing strategic plans to support climate impact measurement and environmental sustainability)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WTW<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A consultancy supporting clients in climate-related investment decision-making, including the use of tools like Carbon Journey Planning and Climate Dashboard)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Carbon Journey Planning<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A framework used by WTW to set emissions pathways and guide asset allocation decisions aligned with net-zero transition goals)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Climate Dashboard<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A data and metrics tool developed by WTW to monitor transition risk, physical risk, carbon footprint, and climate solutions, aiding clients' decision-making)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Railpen<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The investment manager for UK railway pension schemes, utilizing CRIANZA to assess climate risks and net-zero alignment in investment decisions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRIANZA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A proprietary framework developed by Railpen to evaluate companies' climate risk and net-zero alignment at the portfolio level)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATIXIS<|>ANNE-CHRISTINE CHAMPION<|>Anne-Christine Champion is Co-Head of Natixis Corporate & Investment Banking<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GROUPE BPCE<|>GWF<|>Groupe BPCE uses the GWF tool to measure climate impact and set environmental targets<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WTW<|>Clients<|>WTW supports clients in making climate-related investment decisions and implementing net-zero strategies<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RAILPEN<|>CRIANZA<|>Railpen uses the CRIANZA framework to assess climate risk and net-zero alignment<|>7)\n##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
