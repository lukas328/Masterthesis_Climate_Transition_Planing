From 2023–7 we are \nlooking to engage these top 100 emitters via  \na bespoke programme to support them on their \ndecarbonisation journey and help to align our \nmutual ambitions. Beginning in 2023, our top  \n10 suppliers who represent c.65% of our \npurchased goods and services emissions footprint \nwill be a priority for this bespoke engagement.  \nWe have also set a number of targets for key \nsuppliers on the pathway to our interim 2030 \ntarget as shown in figure 29.\nWe have also developed our ESG Supply Chain \nStandards to codify our expectations of partners \naround net zero, including a dedicated set  \nof environmental standards for SMEs. In the \nfollowing section we detail how we will achieve  \nthis through our bespoke engagement  \nprogramme for material suppliers.\n1  Key suppliers include: strategic (those that we work closely with \ndue to the strategic nature of the services they provide), critical \n(suppliers where the goods or services provided is limited in the \nmarket and barriers to change are complex) and operational with \nspend ≥£1m (suppliers which are numerous but where value to \nPhoenix is significant).\nFigure 29: Summary of supply chain targets\nSupply chain targets Target year\n75% of key suppliers signed up to either SBTi or committed to UN’s Race to Zero initiative 2022\n90% of key suppliers signed up to either SBTi or committed to UN’s Race to Zero initiative 2023\n25% of highest emitting suppliers with SBTi-based target in line  \nwith net zero roadmap\n2025\n90% of suppliers (by spend) to be fully aligned with Phoenix Group’s net zero targets 2027\nReduce supply chain carbon intensity by 50% (from indicative estimated 2019 baseline) 2030\nNet zero supply chain  (from indicative estimated 2019 baseline) 2050\n61\nPhoenix Group Holdings plc Net Zero Transition Plan\nInvest Engage Lead\nEmbedding net zero \nin our business\nBecoming a \nnet zero business Measuring our progress\nExecutive \nsummary\n3 Execute actions\nSupply chain\nWe have identified three key focus \nareas to deliver our supply chain \ndecarbonisation: key supplier \nengagement, including bespoke \nengagement with our top 100 \nsuppliers; building net zero into our \nsupplier management processes; and \nupskilling our relevant colleagues.\nKey supplier engagement\nThroughout the course of 2022, we have been \nengaging key suppliers to ensure that they are \naligned with Phoenix Group’s net zero ambition. \nOur approach involves regular engagements \ntailored by supplier to support them with their \nnet zero transition. This has allowed us to provide \nperspectives on the commercial and wider \nbenefits that positive environmental action can \nhave, such as reduced energy cost through energy \nefficiency investment and onsite renewable energy \ngeneration. We have also directed our suppliers \nto best-practice tools and frameworks to support \nthem in developing their own net zero ambitions.\nTo date, this bespoke approach to engagement \nhas enabled us to make material progress  \non our priority focus areas for suppliers,  \nincluding setting robust external climate  \ntargets, influencing behaviour and actions and  \nembedding robust governance.\nRobust external climate targets\nWe encourage our suppliers to set a science-based \ntarget and we support key suppliers with executive \nengagement and stakeholder management to help \nthem deliver on ambitious commitments which \nalign with our decarbonisation pathway.\nInfluencing behaviour and action\nEducating our suppliers and influencing them \nto take action on decarbonisation has been an \nimportant area of focus. In addition to encouraging \nsuppliers to set robust targets, we encourage them \nto commit to procuring wholly renewable energy \nand sign up to our CDP supplier survey.\nProviding action plan templates and sessions \nto help determine where a key supplier is on \ntheir journey allows us to support them with \ndetermining their strategy and prioritising  \nactions to deliver impact.\nEmbedding robust governance\nWe encourage and advise suppliers on how to set \na robust sustainability governance process and \nensure sufficient and appropriate representation \nto oversee the development, implementation and \nreview of their net zero strategy, plan and targets. \nWe expect our supplier to work alongside a \nqualified climate, sustainability, or environmental \nconsultant to develop their net zero strategy.\nBespoke engagement with  \ntop 100 material suppliers\nIn 2023 – 2027 we are looking to evolve our \nsupply chain decarbonisation programme to \ndevelop a more targeted approach based on \nshort- and medium-term emissions reductions, \nstarting with our top 100 material suppliers who \naccount for c.95% of our supply chain emissions. \nInitially, we will look to prioritise maintaining \nmaterial supplier engagement, supporting and \nencouraging our top 100 material suppliers \nto regularly ramp up their decarbonisation \nambitions. We will work closely alongside \nour top 10 material suppliers and the most \nmature suppliers to support them to \ndecarbonise at a faster rate from 2024 onwards. \nThis engagement strategy will function as \na dedicated data-driven decarbonisation \nworkstream that sits alongside our current  \nnet zero asks of key suppliers.\nOur proposed carbon reduction levers\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PHOENIX GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Phoenix Group is a financial services company focused on insurance and asset management, actively working towards decarbonisation and net zero targets through supplier engagement and ESG standards)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SBTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) is an organization that supports companies in setting science-based emissions reduction targets aligned with climate science)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UN’S RACE TO ZERO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Race to Zero is a global campaign led by the United Nations to encourage companies and organizations to achieve net zero emissions by 2050)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOP 100 MATERIAL SUPPLIERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The top 100 suppliers that account for approximately 95% of Phoenix Group's supply chain emissions, targeted for bespoke decarbonisation engagement from 2023 to 2027)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOP 10 SUPPLIERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The ten largest suppliers representing about 65% of purchased goods and services emissions, prioritized for accelerated decarbonisation efforts starting in 2024)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ESG SUPPLY CHAIN STANDARDS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Standards developed by Phoenix Group to define expectations for suppliers regarding environmental and net zero commitments, including standards for SMEs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CASHION<|>GEO<|>Capital city in the context of the supply chain engagement, not explicitly a geographic entity but used as a reference point in the document)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ENERGY COST<|>EVENT<|>Cost savings from energy efficiency investments and renewable energy adoption by suppliers, linked to decarbonisation efforts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NET ZERO<|>EVENT<|>The goal of achieving zero net emissions across the supply chain and operations by 2050, as part of Phoenix Group’s climate strategy)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>2022<|>EVENT<|>Year when Phoenix Group began engaging key suppliers to support their net zero transition)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>2023<|>EVENT<|>Year when Phoenix Group plans to have 90% of key suppliers signed up to SBTi or UN Race to Zero)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>2025<|>EVENT<|>Target year for 25% of highest emitting suppliers to have SBTi-based targets aligned with net zero roadmap)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>2027<|>EVENT<|>Target year for 90% of suppliers (by spend) to be fully aligned with Phoenix Group’s net zero targets)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>2030<|>EVENT<|>Target year to reduce supply chain carbon intensity by 50% from 2019 baseline)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>2050<|>EVENT<|>Target year for achieving net zero supply chain emissions from 2019 baseline)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PHOENIX GROUP<|>SBTI<|>Phoenix Group encourages its suppliers to set science-based targets supported by SBTi<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PHOENIX GROUP<|>UN’S RACE TO ZERO<|>Phoenix Group supports its suppliers in committing to the UN Race to Zero initiative<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TOP 100 MATERIAL SUPPLIERS<|>PHOENIX GROUP<|>Phoenix Group is engaging its top 100 suppliers to support decarbonisation<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TOP 10 SUPPLIERS<|>PHOENIX GROUP<|>The top 10 suppliers are prioritized for faster decarbonisation efforts starting in 2024<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ESG SUPPLY CHAIN STANDARDS<|>PHOENIX GROUP<|>The standards define expectations for suppliers regarding net zero and environmental commitments<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PHOENIX GROUP<|>2022<|>Phoenix Group began engaging key suppliers to support their net zero transition<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PHOENIX GROUP<|>2023<|>Phoenix Group aims for 90% of key suppliers to be signed up to SBTi or UN Race to Zero<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PHOENIX GROUP<|>2025<|>Target year for 25% of high-emitting suppliers to have SBTi-based targets<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PHOENIX GROUP<|>2027<|>Target year for 90% of suppliers (by spend) to be aligned with net zero targets<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PHOENIX GROUP<|>2030<|>Target to reduce supply chain carbon intensity by 50%<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PHOENIX GROUP<|>2050<|>Goal to achieve a net zero supply chain<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
