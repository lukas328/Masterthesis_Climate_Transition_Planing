Following this \nacqusition, we refreshed our sustainability strategy \nto reflect the shape, scale and business strategy \nof the new enlarged organisation and rapidly \nevolving stakeholder expectations along with the \nurgent need for market transformation to deliver \nsustainable growth.\nTo inform our sustainability strategy we conducted a materiality \nassessment to identify the sustainability issues, risks and opportunities \nmost relevant to our business and our stakeholders. We also aligned \nour approach with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. \nAs a result, we have shaped our sustainability strategy around three \noutcome-focused priorities which represent the areas where we can \nhave the greatest impact, including our role in the transition to net zero.\nLSEG CLIMATE TRANSITION PLAN 20225\nOur sustainability priorities \nAccelerate the just transition to net zero\nDecarbonising the whole global economy is critical to minimise the worst consequences of  \nclimate change. \nWe are leveraging LSEG’s unique market position, capabilities, products and services to support a  \nglobal reallocation of capital which shares the costs and benefits of reaching net zero fairly between  \nand within countries.\nEnable growth of the green economy\nTo deliver sustainable economic growth, more economic activity must focus on creating, scaling and \ndelivering solutions to the world’s environmental and social challenges.\nLSEG has a pivotal role in helping those solutions thrive by enabling more capital to flow towards \nsustainable economic activity.\nCreate inclusive economic opportunity\nInclusive economies enable more people to participate in, and benefit from, economic growth,  \nregardless of their gender, ethnicity, social background, political or religious beliefs. These economies \nalso uphold high standards of governance, address inequality and respect human rights. \nWe aim to empower economies, communities and individuals by championing inclusion and opening \nup economic opportunity.\nCONTENTS\nLSEG CLIMATE TRANSITION PLAN 20226\nCONTENTS\nTransition to net zero \nLSEG is committed to achieving \nnet zero by 2040. Our unique \nrole at the centre of financial \nmarkets is underpinned by our \npurpose of driving financial \nstability, empowering economies \nand enabling customers to create \nsustainable growth.\nOur purpose is inextricably linked with climate \nchange. We believe that decarbonising  \nthe whole global economy is critical to minimise \nthe worst consequences of climate change  \nand reflects our central role in enabling  \nthe market transformation required to achieve  \na net zero economy. \nLSEG CLIMATE TRANSITION PLAN 20227\nCONTENTS\nThe evolution of Climate Transition Plans \nAs more businesses accelerate \ntheir commitments to reduce and \nremove their emissions across their \nvalue chain, we believe that the \npublication of Climate Transition \nPlans will play an increasingly \nimportant role.\nClimate Transition Plans explain how \ncommitments translate into action, enabling more \ninformed investment decision-making, deeper \nengagement between companies and investors \nand market-wide collaboration.\nAt present there is limited consensus around \nwhat constitutes best practice with respect \nto preparing a Climate Transition Plan. This is \nLSEG’s first such Plan where we explain our \ncommitments and approach, covering both our \nnear-term targets and how we will identify actions \nrequired beyond 2030.  \nWe support the evolution and adoption of best \npractice guidance for Climate Transition Plans \nand will review and refine our Plan over time.\nAt COP26, the UK Government announced that \nit will make the UK the first net zero-aligned \nfinancial centre.
