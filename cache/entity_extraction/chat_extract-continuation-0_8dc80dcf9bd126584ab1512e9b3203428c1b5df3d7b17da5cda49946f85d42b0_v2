We will continue to ensure that climate-related \nrisks are considered appropriately throughout our governance arrangements, including the policy framework and \nmanagement committees’ responsibilities. We also continue to reflect on changes in regulatory expectations (e.g, \nfrom the Prudential Regulation Authority, 'PRA') while embedding climate risk management through the RMF. \nAs a result the financial risks from climate change do not appear in our principal risks above but the table below \ndoes show how the key themes are impacted. \nShort Medium Long \nRisk drivers Relevant principal risk and potential impact term1 term term Mitigating actions \nTransition: \nPolicy & Legal \nChanges in\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BUPA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Bupa is a global healthcare group providing health insurance, medical services, and care services, with a focus on delivering value to customers amidst economic and geopolitical challenges.
