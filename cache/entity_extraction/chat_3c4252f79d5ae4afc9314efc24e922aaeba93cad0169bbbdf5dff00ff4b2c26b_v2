A \nplan of dialogue and accompaniment of \nthe customer with measures aimed at \nunderstanding and trying to correct the \nsituation may then be undertaken. \nBBVA will not support the provision of \nfinancial services to wholesale customers \nincluded in the scope of the Framework \nwhen there is sufficient evidence that they \nor their transactions are involved in the \nprohibited activities foreseen in the defense \nsector. In the rest of the industries (mining, \nenergy, agribusiness and infrastructure), \na specific analysis of the situation will be \ncarried out. This may involve non-initiation \nof the relationship, or adoption of a plan of \ndialogue and accompaniment with the client \nwith measures aimed at understanding and \ntrying to correct the situation.\nAlthough the Environmental and Social \nFramework is applicable to new clients and \nnew projects from its publication date, a \nreview process has been carried out, based \non best efforts, of the stock of clients for the \nprogressive implementation of the measures \nprovided therein. Since 2021 more than 300 \nbusiness groups were analyzed under this \nframework. BBVA initiated a dialogue and \naccompaniment plan with 17 groups.\nBBVA identifies, accredits and documents \nthe activity carried out by retail customers \nthrough KYC (Know Y our Client) under a \nrisk-based approach.

Analysis of customers’ \nenvironmental and social risks and \nopportunities\nBBVA has developed a “Guide for the \nintegration of ESG factors in wholesale \ncredit analysis” which identifies the key \nenvironmental and social aspects by \nindustry and presents metrics to monitor the \nperformance of our corporate clients.\nIn addition, BBVA has specified an internal \ntaxonomy of transition risk. The purpose \nis to classify sectors according to their \nsensitivity to this type of risk. In the \ndevelopment of its sectoral frameworks \nused in credit approval, BBVA identifies \nthe metrics that make it possible to assess \nthe vulnerability of each client to transition \nrisks and to integrate this aspect into risk \nand support decisions. Further information \non this point is available in the chapter \n Integrating climate change into risk planning  in this \nreport.\nProgress is also being made in developing \ninternal capabilities to classify clients based \non their climate reporting, low-carbon \nbusiness profile and decarbonization plans.\nIn the area of Corporate and Business \nBanking (CBB), BBVA was pioneering in the \nuse of data analytics to calculate companies’ \ncarbon footprint and use it to offer value-\ncreating solutions to our customers. The \ncarbon footprint calculator for companies \nprovides information on the ESG profile of \nclients (footprint calculation, change over \ntime, comparison with the sector average \nand similar companies, etc.), which allows us \nto categorize our clients and to implement \ntargeted, personalized and tailored advisory \nand commercial actions adapted to each \nclient’s profile. \nRecently functionalities have been added \nwhich allow the definition of energy saving \ntargets, alerts which provide a warning when \nthe target is not being met, and a comparison \nof consumption with other companies in \nthe same sector of activity (NACE), similar \nlevel of revenue and number of employees \non the workforce, indicating the percentile of \nmonthly expenses compared with peers.\nIn addition, BBVA uses natural language \nprocessing techniques for ESG categorization \nof business customers on a large scale \nfrom public information such as corporate \ncustomer websites, official records, news, \netc. This leadership in digital transformation \nenriches the business information provided \nand helps customers improve their \nenvironmental performance. \nBBVA was the first bank in Spain to offer \nthe calculation of the carbon footprint to \nits individual customers thanks to its digital \nand data analytics capabilities. This service \nraises the awareness of the Bank’s individual \ncustomers on the impact its actions have on \nthe environment, and help them transition to \na more sustainable world. \nBy adding the characteristics of the home \n(surface area, energy certification, etc.), \nBBVA can assess improvements in energy \nefficiency and offer information on simple \nand sustainable changes in habits that help \nreduce the amounts in the household bills of \nits individual customers.\nBesides, the cost of an electric vehicle can \nbe compared to a gasoline vehicle so that the \nindividual customer can see the economic \nadvantages of opting for a more sustainable \ntransport solution. Customers will also be \nable to view and/or subscribe to any of the \nsustainable products offered by BBVA. The \nBank provides its customers with the Valora \ntool, which allows them to have an estimated \nautomatic appraisal of their real estate and \ntransportation assets.\n.\nP.  45\nBBVA Report on TCFD 2022\nThis English version is a translation of the original in Spanish for information purposes only.
