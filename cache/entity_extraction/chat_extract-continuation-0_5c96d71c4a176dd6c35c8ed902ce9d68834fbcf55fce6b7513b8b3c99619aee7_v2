We will \ncontinue to engage with the board to support this.\nProxy voting\nFixed Income\nEquities\nSustainability and Stewardship Report\n48\nCase study:\nExxonMobil: voting against management \nrecommendation on four resolutions \nThis engagement was led by our Thematic Equity and 4Factor teams. At the \nExxonMobil AGM in May 2023, 12 shareholder resolutions were proposed, \nnine of which were on environmental issues, two on governance issues \nand one on social issues. We considered all of these on an individual basis, \nand voted in favour of four of these resolutions, against management’s \nrecommendation: 1) improved methane emission disclosure; 2) disclosure \non carbon capture and storage projects; 3) adoption of a medium-term \nScope 3 greenhouse gas reduction target; and 4) more granular disclosure \non emissions by asset, taking into account the impact of divestment. We \nchose not to support the additional eight resolutions because we believed \nthat these items were either already being addressed or did not reflect \npriority concerns. \nAlthough none of the supported resolutions were passed by a majority \nof shareholders, a significant proportion voted in favour (the highest \nbeing 36% in favour of the methane-related resolution). ExxonMobil is \na signatory to the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative’s (“OCGI’s”) Aiming for  \nZero Methane Emissions Initiative and, along with 11 other signatories, \nwill strive to reach near-zero methane emissions from operated oil and \ngas assets by 2030. We will continue to engage with the company on \nthis and the other issues highlighted, and use our voting power to lend \nweight to the discussions where progress is not made and to hold the \ncompany to account if their commitments are not met.\nPlease refer to Appendix 3  for a summary of our most significant votes \nover the period, including rationales for our voting decision, as per \nthe Shareholder Rights Directive II (“SRDII”) requirements. Ninety One \ndescribes these as votes where there is a significant holding (>5% of the \nshares or >5% of a fund) and is a dissenting vote against management, \nor those where there is a significant qualitative factor in that the vote \nrelates to: an ESG issue, a shareholder resolution with a dissenting vote \nagainst management, or a significant corporate transaction.\nEquities\nProxy voting\n49\nSustainability and Stewardship Report49\n5\nThrough advocacy, we seek to \nengage our clients and stakeholders \non sustainability. Our advocacy work \nis monitored and guided by the \nSustainability Committee.\n50\nSustainability and Stewardship Report50\nSustainability and Stewardship Report\nOur approach to advocate\nThrough advocacy, we seek to engage our clients and stakeholders on \nsustainability to help develop the ecosystem for sustainable long-term investing. \nThis takes many forms, including contribution to industry collaboration, policy \nadvocacy and thought leadership. Where appropriate, we seek to influence \npolicy, regulation and laws, aiming to facilitate efficient capital markets, a real-\neconomy net-zero transition, and favourable environments for shareholder rights \nand interests. \nOver the reporting period, we focused on the need to ensure that emerging \nmarkets receive the funding required to transition.\nCase study: spotlight on South Africa’s \nJust Energy Transition\nAs a global firm with our roots in South Africa, a just transition is core to our values. \nWhile we advocate for the transition to a lower-carbon global energy system, we \nbelieve that cannot come at the expense of people, especially those who are already \ndisproportionately affected by the impacts of a warmer world. As we continue to \nadvocate for South Africa to transition its coal-powered energy utility, we are also \nconscious of the impact of this on both workers and communities. In the case of \nSouth Africa, that is mainly the coalminers and utility workers in a concentrated area \nin Mpumalanga. An engagement approach that recognises this complexity is required. \nWe have advocated for just transition principles at three levels: (1) directly with the \nlocal coal-power utility through the implementation of its transition plan; (2) local \nindustry engagement across the coal and energy value chain to support the utility; \nand (3) with both local and global thought-leaders, policymakers and financiers to \ninform just transition financing plans, policies and advocacy activity. We believe that a \ncoordinated, ‘all-of-system’ advocacy approach is necessary to achieve a measured \nand high-impact Just Transition solution in South Africa.\nA holistic approach to engaging for a Just Transition in South Africa.\nPolicy and finance\nThe value chain\nThe company\n\nSustainability and Stewardship Report\n51\nIndustry collaboration\nNinety One participates in organisations and initiatives whose \npurpose and advocacy goals are aligned with those of our investment \nteams and clients.
