This means obtaining the following certifications and memberships:\n • Forestry, Rubberwood, Pulp and Paper – Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and Programme for the Endorsement of \nForest Certification (PEFC).\n • Palm oil – Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO).\n • Soy – Roundtable for Responsible Soy (RTRS).\n • Beef/Leather – Global Roundtable for Sustainable Beef (GRSB)/Leather Working Group (LWG).\n • Cocoa – Rainforest Alliance, Fairtrade.\nAs a member of the Powering Past Coal update, \nwe continued to support the alliance’s aims as we \nprogress towards a full phase-out of coal by 2030.\nTotal exposure to the oil and gas sector increased \nby £0.3 billion compared with 31 December 2021 \n– £3,577 million as at 31 December 2022 \ncompared to £,3,254 million as at 31 December \n2021.

These assessments involved three components: a quantitative assessment using an independent third-party \nproprietary model to assess alignment with the 2015 Paris Agreement; a credibility assessment; and finally a management \nreview and assessment. For further details of this assessment process refer to pages 30 - 31 of our 2021 Climate-related \nDisclosures Report. \nCoal customers who had less than 15% of their activities relating to coal and were not in scope of the CTP assessment \nare still required to fully phase-out of coal by 2030.\nAs at 31 December 2022 our exposure to oil and \ngas majors amounted to £0.9 billion(*) (31 December \n2021 – £0.8 billion), representing 25% of the total \nexposure to the oil and gas sector.\nExposure to coal customers, within the scope \nof the CTP analysis, was £0.3 billion(*) as at \n31 December 2022 (£0.6 billion as at  \n31 December 2021). \n(1) Producers of goods such as palm oil, soy and cocoa operating in tropical, sub-tropical and temperate rainforests.\n(*) Within scope of EY assurance.

NatWest Group lending to this sector was £4.8 billion at 31 December 2022 (£5.1 billion at \n31 December 2021).\nSystem context: The food system has a vital part to play in ensuring food security in the UK economy. As per the \nNational Statistics on Agricultural Land Use in United Kingdom at 1 June 2022 published by the Department for \nEnvironment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) in December 2022, farms account for almost 70% of the total area of \nthe UK in 2022. As per the UK CCC 2022 Progress Report published in 2022, agriculture and land accounts for \n12% of total greenhouse gas emissions in the UK and the land use sector needs to become a net sink by the \nmid-2030s if the UK is to achieve its net-zero targets by removing more greenhouse gases from the atmosphere \nthan emissions released from land use activities. We recognise that creating the business case for farmers and \nlandowners to invest into more sustainable agricultural technologies and practices requires an alignment of financial \nand regulatory incentives across the entire food system. Development of the initial iteration of our Climate transition \nplan during 2022 has primarily focused on the agriculture sector with estimated absolute emissions related to \nprimary farming activities of 3.9MtCO2e at 31 December 2021 and emissions intensity of 2,111 tCO2e/£m. This \nwork included assessment of opportunities for NatWest Group to support its agricultural customers to reduce and \nreverse impacts to climate and environment as well as engagement with the UK Government, wider food system \nand NGOs to create practical solutions to support farmers and landowners to contribute to the achievement of the \nUK’s climate targets.\nKey products and services to support decarbonisation:\n • Development of green lending products: As part of our\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
