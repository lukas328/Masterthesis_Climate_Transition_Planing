We know how these \ncustomers operate, and we can help them transition as the powertrain evolves.\nOur performance in 2022/23\nIn Clean Air, we are focused on our target of generating at least £4 billion of cash to 2030/31, \nwhich is underpinned by tightening emission control legislation, business wins, \nmanufacturing footprint consolidation and other fixed cost reductions. In 2022/23 we \ngenerated around £600 million of cash, taking our cumulative cash generation over two \nyears to £1.4 billion. However, underlying operating profit declined 28% to £230 million and \nmargins decreased to 8.7%. This largely reflected cost inflation, product mix, lower volumes, \nand the transactional impact of exchange rates. We saw an improvement in margins during \nthe year due to an acceleration in our pricing, and we are expecting strong growth in \noperating performance in 2023/24.\nWe continued to build our commercial muscle, improving our inflation recovery rate with the \nmajority of the recovery in the second half of the year, while also winning our targeted business \nlinked to Euro 7 and equivalent legislation globally. During the year we won all of Mercedes \nBenz’s light duty diesel business in Europe, and the global contracts covering light duty gasoline \nand diesel with a leading automotive OEM. As further evidence of our stronger commercial \nmuscle, these wins were achieved whilst negotiating inflationary cost increases and improving \nour customer satisfaction score by five points. Consequently, we are outperforming the rate of \nbusiness wins required to achieve our cash generation target of at least £4 billion by 2030/31.\nSupply chain disruption, semiconductor shortages and the ongoing consequences of the global \npandemic all affected our customers, creating additional challenges around variability and \npredictability of demand. Our logistics partners also experienced continued pressure around \ncapacity, cost and lead times. We worked hard to support our entire value chain – and our \nefforts led to us winning several customer awards, including the 2022 General Motors Overdrive \nAward for Relationship.\nWe are optimising our manufacturing footprint to not only drive efficiencies but strengthen \nour development, manufacturing and delivery processes. Our optimised footprint will be more \nagile and flexible, allowing us to respond quickly to market changes. \nIn China, we have adapted our commercial and technology structure to have more of a local \nfocus. This improved our chances of successful delivery to the local market and provides even \nmore growth potential for the region moving forward.\nContinuing to win big with some of the \nworld’s largest companies\nAll over the world, governments are \nintroducing increasingly stringent \nair quality and pollution legislation. \nThis creates a big opportunity for Clean \nAir, and the last year has seen us continue \nto win new business and strengthen \nexisting relationships. \nIn an increasingly challenging and \ncompetitive market environment, our \ninvestment in our sales capabilities and \nnew focus on value and pricing, led by the \ncommercial council, is generating positive \nresults. To deliver £4 billion cash by  \n2030/31, we will need to continue to build \non the momentum generated this year. \nAmong our big wins in 2022/23 were: \n• Breaking the record for the largest \nbusiness deal in JM’s history with a new \n£1.2 billion deal with a leading \nautomotive company\n• Securing a 10-year deal worth \n£450 million with a world-famous \nautomotive brand’s three European \nplatforms \n• Awarded the entire Euro 7 light duty \ndiesel business of one of our long-\nstanding automotive clients \n• Securing £50 million and £180 million \ndeals with two of India’s largest \ncommercial vehicle manufacturers.\nWatch: fighting pollution  \nfor 50 years and beyond: matthey.com/\nclean-air-50-years\nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 2023 15\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION\nClean Air continued\nPlatinum Group Metal Services  \nThe industry-leading, growth-focused  \nbedrock of Johnson Matthey\nWe apply our deep expertise and long history \nin platinum group metals (PGMs) to provide \nsolutions to the complex challenges our customers \nface.
