The Chairman (who is also a member \nof the Remuneration Committee), the Group Chief \nSustainability and People Officer and the Director of \nPerformance and Reward held a session with interested \nAMs to discuss the key design features of the SPP and \nanswer any queries the AMs had in advance of the \n2022 AGM. The Chair of the Remuneration Committee \nwas unable to attend the session due to illness. \nThe resolution to approve the DRP was comfortably \npassed at the AGM. \nAM briefings during the year were hosted by the \nChairman and presented by the Group CEO and \nGroup CFO. The briefings covered: \n▪ The Group’s financial results for Full Year 2021 \nand Half Year 2022 \n▪ Our sustainability and ESG agenda and new \nsustainability strategy \n▪ Our LUX MED business in Poland and the actions \ntaken to support Ukrainian refugees entering Poland. \nSuppliers and partners \nOur suppliers and partners represent our brand \nand are critical to delivering a high-quality service \nto our customers. \nOur Responsible Supply Chain Statement, available \nhere, sets out our expectations of our suppliers and our \ncommitments to them. The Statement was updated in \n2022 to include our desire to work with suppliers who \nshare our commitment to our sustainability targets and \nto work with them to innovate and find solutions to the \nsustainability challenges around healthcare. \nWe are committed to: \n▪ Treating our suppliers fairly \n▪ Paying suppliers on time (as per contracted terms) \n▪ Selecting suppliers without prejudice \n▪ Supporting improvements in social, environmental \nand ethical practices \n▪ Using research, collaboration and innovation to \naccelerate sustainable healthcare solutions \n▪ Maintaining a supply chain that reflects and \naligns with our own standards of responsible \nbusiness conduct \n▪ Actively encouraging innovation. \nWe also have a Group-wide Suppliers Enterprise \nRisk Policy governing our processes for the selection, \ncontracting and management of all of our suppliers \nto ensure that they represent our values and will not \ncompromise the service we provide to our customers \nor how we treat our people. We work with our suppliers \nto ensure that they have effective processes in place \nto protect our customers’ health and safety and the \nsecurity and privacy of their data. \nWe also regularly engage with healthcare professionals \nand NGOs and work with other commercial and non-\nprofit organisations to make a positive impact on \nspecific health issues. \nOur sustainability strategy is founded on responsible \nbusiness conduct with a key focus on responsible \nsupply chain management, including combating modern \nslavery. Our latest Modern Slavery Statement is \ndescribed on page 34. \nCommunities and the environment \nIn 2022, the Board approved the new sustainability \nstrategy and a revised sustainability enterprise risk \npolicy to set out our ambitions in this area and to \nensure that sustainability risks and opportunities, \nincluding climate change risks, are considered in \nday-to-day decision-making. \nFor further information see the Sustainability and \nESG section on page 22 and the report of the Board \nSustainability Committee on page 79.
