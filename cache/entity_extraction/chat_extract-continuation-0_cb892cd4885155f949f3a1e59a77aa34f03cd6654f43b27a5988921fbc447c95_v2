Intangible assets acquired separately are held at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment. \nCosts relating to the development of intangible assets, including computer software, are capitalised once all \ndevelopment phase recognition criteria are met. \nAmortisation is charged to the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis as follows, excluding any \nintangible assets to which an indefinite useful life has been attributed: \n▪ Computer software 2-10 years \n▪ Brand and trademarks 3 years-indefinite \n▪ Customer relationships 3-20 years \n▪ Technology and databases 10 years \n▪ Distribution networks 10-14 years \n▪ Present value of acquired in-force business 20 years \n▪ Customer contracts 4-6 years \n▪ Licences to operate care homes Term of licence \n▪ Bed licences in Australia From 1 October 2021 to 1 July 2024 \nIntangible assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment if circumstances indicate that the \ncarrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement \nto reduce the carrying amount to the recoverable amount. \nIntangible assets with an indefinite useful life, or not yet available for use, are subject to annual impairment reviews \nor more frequently if there is an indication that the carrying value may be impaired. \nIn other intangibles, the Group holds bed licences, with a carrying value of £50m (2021: £83m), with respect \nto Bupa Villages and Aged Care Australia CGU.

indefinite useful economic life to cover the period from 1 October 2021 to 1 July 2024. \nDuring 2022, the Group has recognised £34m (2021: £8m) of amortisation in respect of Australian bed licences.
