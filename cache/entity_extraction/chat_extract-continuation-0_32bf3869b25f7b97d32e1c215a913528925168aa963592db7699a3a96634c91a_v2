Our \nalignment score for 2021 was impacted by our clients’ operational priorities as well as the residual impacts \nof the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular the effect of port congestion and demand in the container sector \nas well as the tentative resumption of the cruise industry in 2021. The cruise segment represented +6.3% \nof our total alignment score of +12.2%, indicating that we are slightly more misaligned compared to the \n2020 alignment score of +11.7%. Our cargo alignment score was also impacted in 2021 due to the  \nsignificant tonnage demand increase in dry cargo as well as the pre-existing issues in the container \nsector . Most of the misalignment relates to three individual client situations in which COVID-19-driven \noperational issues during 2021 are unlikely to have been repeated in 2022. We therefore expect significant \nimprovement in next year’s report for our 2022 total alignment score, which will be reflective of a more \nnormal market environment. \nCiti continues to partner with clients that are actively considering the development of the next generation \nof shipping technology. The new International Maritime Organization (IMO) Carbon Intensity Indicator \n(CII) and Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (EEXI) regulations that went into effect in January 2023 \nprovide further signals as to where the industry needs to reduce emissions and explore retrofitting \nopportunities. Although decarbonizing shipping depends on the pace of the energy transition, we see \nclients looking to source alternative fuels, develop new technologies and consider additional alternative \nsolutions as part of their long-term strategy. We will continue to support our clients in all of their different \napproaches to reduce emissions which, in turn, will help Citi meet its own targets as we look to support the \ndecarbonization of global supply chains. \nIn 2022, Citi delivered its Poseidon Principles disclosure to the Secretariat, and that disclosure is now \npublished on the Poseidon Principles website.\nRisk Exposure   \nWe provide an update to our climate risk heat mapping, for which we developed a more formal and \ndetailed methodology in 2021 to determine the vulnerability scores assigned to each sector . The climate \nrisk heat mapping categorizes sectors under one of four vulnerability scores, ranging from “low” to \n“high.” We have established sub-scores using the rubric in the following table for various aspects of \ntransition and physical risks.\n52 | TCFD REPORT 2022: CITI’S APPROACH TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND NET ZERO\nCLIMATE RISK HEAT MAPPING\n1 2 3 4\nTransition \nRisks\nRegulatory No regulatory/\npolicy changes \nare expected to \nmeaningfully impact \nthe sector financially \nsuch as through \nasset devaluation, \nincreased \nexpenditure (e.g., \ncompliance costs) \nand/or loss of \nrevenue\nMinor impact to the \nsector expected \nfrom potential \nregulatory/policy \nchanges (e.g., \nbuilding efficiency) \nresulting in \nfinancial impact \nasset devaluation, \nincreased \nexpenditure (e.g., \ncompliance costs) \nor loss of revenue; \nimpact only on \na subset of the \nsector , subset of \ngeographies and/or \nonly indirect impact \nModerate impact to \nthe sector expected \nfrom regulatory/\npolicy changes \n(e\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CITI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Citi is a global financial services corporation that provides banking, investment, and financial risk management services.
