Risk strategy and culture\nSustainability and minimising environmental \nimpact are a key component of the Group’s \nstrategy. We have a specific sustainability \nstrategy and set net zero carbon \ncommitments for operations, supply chain  \nand the investment portfolio, as well as \nspecific annual goals such as sustainable \norigination targets for private placements.\n2. Risk appetite\nThe sustainability risk appetite statement  \nis approved by the Board and was updated \nduring 2022 to reflect our latest sustainability \nstrategy. We have approved supporting \nclimate risk appetite statements and metrics \nwith footprints throughout the Risk Universe.\n3. Risk Universe\nClimate risk is treated as cross-cutting risk, \nrather than standalone risk, as it can \npotentially impact all risk categories \nunderlying the Risk Universe. \n4. Risk policies\nAll policies have been reviewed to ensure \nappropriate content is included for material \nclimate risk exposures. Policies with a \npotential climate impact contain specific \nflags to ensure climate risk is clearly considered.\n5. Governance and organisation\nGovernance is led by the Board Risk and \nBoard Sustainability Committees plus \nsupporting management committees.  \nThere is clarity on roles and responsibilities \nacross the three lines of defence.\n6. Emerging risk\nClimate and ESG risks continue to  \nbe monitored via the well-established \nemerging risk process, which also  \nconsiders the evolving regulatory  \nlandscape. This is supported by  \nforward-looking Own Risk and Solvency \nAssessment (‘ORSA’) monitoring.\n7. Strategic risk management\nClimate risk is a principal risk and considered \nas part of Line 2 oversight of strategic \ndevelopments, e.g. annual operating  \nplan development, project reviews,  \nORSA, management actions and regular  \nrisk reporting.\n8. Risk and capital models\nExternal tools have been sourced to support \ncarbon footprinting and climate scenario \nanalysis. Models have been developed  \nfor internal climate scenario analysis  \nwith enhancements made in 2022 and  \nplanned in 2023.\n9. Risk and control processes and reporting\nA climate risk dashboard covering key Level 1 \nrisks is integrated into our regular risk \nreporting. Minimum control standards  \nare also in place for key policies.\n72\nPhoenix Group Holdings plc Net Zero Transition Plan\nInvest Engage Lead\nEmbedding net zero \nin our business\nBecoming a \nnet zero business Measuring our progress\nExecutive \nsummary\nWe have developed a comprehensive metrics framework  \nwhich allows us to measure and manage the impacts of \ntransition and physical risk on our investment portfolio, \noperations and supply chain.
