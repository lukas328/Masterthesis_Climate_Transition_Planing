Shareholders,\nT wo years ago Barclays laid \nout a new climate approach \nin response to the climate \ncrisis. We set out an ambition \nto become net zero by 2050, \nacross all of our direct and \nindirect emissions, and we \ncommitted to align all of our \nfinancing activities with the \ngoals and timelines of the \nParis Agreement. We made \nit clear at the time that we \nwould approach the climate \nchallenge thoughtfully and \ntransparently, reporting \nto shareholders and other \nstakeholders and be \naccountable for our progress.\nThis document sets out our climate strategy \nand targets and reports on the progress \nwhich\twe\thave\tmade.\tIt\talso\tsets\tout\tthose\t\nareas in which the bank has continued \nto evolve its approach. Probably most \nnotably, Barclays is now committing to use \nthe\tInternational\tEnergy\tAgency’s\t(IEA)\t\n1.5°C-aligned\tscenario\tas\tits\tbaseline\tfor\tnew\t\ntargets. We have already set 2025 targets \nfor\tPower\tand\tEnergy,\tbut\twe\tare\tnow\tadding\t\n2030\ttargets,\tand\tfor\tCement\tand\tSteel\tas\t\nwell. We are also committing to phase out \nfinancing\tof\tthermal\tcoal.\t\nChairman’s \nletter to \nshareholders\nWe took the decision a year ago that, at \nthe 2022 Annual General Meeting, we \nwould\toffer\tour\tshareholders\ta\tvote\ton\tour\t\napproach to climate change in the round. \nWe have had discussions with several major \nshareholders and industry bodies over many \nmonths\tand\tare\tgrateful\tfor\ttheir\tinput.\tIt\t\nis not a simple task to address the climate \nchallenge whilst also giving appropriate \nsupport to those companies which we \nbelieve are committed to the transition. \nWe also respect legitimate concerns about \nenergy security, energy poverty and the \njust transition. We hope that we have got \nthe\tbalance\tright.\tThe\tappalling\tinvasion\tof\t\nUkraine has made it even more imperative \nto accelerate the energy transition, whilst \nimposing\treal\tchallenges\tin\tachieving\tuniform\t\nyear-on-year progress. Nonetheless, our \ncommitment to our climate ambition and \nNigel Higgins \nChairman\nIt\tis\tnot\ta\tsimple\ttask  \nto address the climate \nchallenge whilst also  \ngiving appropriate \nsupport to those \ncompanies which we \nbelieve\tare committed\t\nto\tthe transition.”\nOur climate  \nstrategy\nOur targets  \nand progress Looking aheadCollaboration\nGovernance and \nrisk management\nAppendix\nIntroduction\nBarclays’ Climate Strategy, T argets and Progress \n20224\nBarclays\tputs\tconsiderable\teffort\tinto\t\nboth\tthe\texpansion\tof\tits\tgreen\tand\t\nsustainable\tfinancing\tactivities\tand\tthe\t\ndiminution\tin\tits\tfossil\tfuel\tfinancing.\tWe\t\nalso\tseek\tto\tcontribute\tmeaningfully\tto\tthe\t\nimprovement\tof\tpolicy\tand\tdata\tcapture\t\nand measurement.
