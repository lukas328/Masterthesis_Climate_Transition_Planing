For the remaining goods and for purchased services a financial allocation (EEIO model) was used\n2. Capital goods Financial allocation (EEIO model) using geographical breakdown of data shown in Accounting note 11 “Property, plant & \nequipment” on page 175\n3. Fuel- and energy-related activities Defra’s GHG reporting conversion factors 2022 were used to calculate well-to-tank GHG emissions from fuel usage, transmission \nand distribution losses from purchased electricity, and well-to-tank and transmission and distribution losses of energy from steam\n4. Upstream transportation and distribution Emissions data was provided by our suppliers where available. Otherwise, a financial allocation was made based on spend and \nintensity factors from the EEIO model\n5. Waste generated in operations Where GHG footprints were available from waste service providers they were used, otherwise Defra’s GHG reporting conversion \nfactors 2022 were used according to mass of waste disposal by destination see page 31\n6. Business travel Footprint business travel for air and rail was obtained from our business travel service providers. Where available mileage \nfor personal car, taxi and public transport use was used in combination with Defra’s GHG reporting conversion factors 2022. \nIn the absence of mileage, a financial allocation was made based on expenses spend and intensity factors from the EEIO model. \nAccounting is by date of financial transaction\n7. Employee commuting Data is obtained by employee survey of miles travelled per week by modes of transport. Defra’s GHG reporting conversion factors \n2022 are used to calculate the GHG intensity of each transport type\n8. Upstream leased assets Financial allocation (EEIO model) using floor space and geographical location\n9. Downstream transportation and distribution Where JM takes responsibility for the downstream distribution of goods, it was included in the upstream category calculation. \nWhere our customers takes responsibility, no data is available\n10. Processing of sold products No quantitative data available, but not expected to be material based on our knowledge of how our customers use our products\n11. Use of sold products We have removed Use of sold products from our footprint by agreement with SBTi, as it determined that the emissions we reported \nin this category were ‘indirect’ and should not, therefore, be included.\n12. End of life treatment of sold products Many of JM’s products are returned to the company for recovery of the precious metals and thus end of life treatment is included \nin our Scope 1 and Scope 2 footprint. JM does not have visibility of other end of life treatments\n13. Downstream leased assets Included in Upstream leased assets category\n14. Franchises JM does not have any franchises\n15. Investments GHG footprints from our Pensions trustee providers were used, where available, and scaled to represent JM's global employee count. \nFinancial allocation (EEIO model) using geographical breakdown of investment revenues from each entity\nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 2023226\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION\nBasis of reporting – non-financial data continued\nPlanet: Protecting nature and advancing \nthe circular economy \nOur goal: Advancing the circular economy to conserve \nscarce resources \nOur KPI to monitor how we are advancing the circular economy is a measurement of all % \nrecycled platinum group metals in our manufactured goods on a mass basis.\nWe include use of five PGMs – platinum, palladium, rhodium, ruthenium and iridium in our \ntarget. This is defined as the weighted global average of all goods manufactured in our plants \nover the course of the reporting year and includes metal that is both sourced and funded \nby JM and metal sourced and funded by our customers.\nWe define primary metal as metal from a mine or originating outside of the refining loop. \nThis is measured by recording the amount of metal matching this description that has been \nused in product manufacturing over the given time-period.\nWe define secondary or recycled metal as platinum-group metal-bearing material that has \ncome from an end use (including post-consumer product scrap and waste materials) and \nhas not come to JM in the form of ingot, concentrate or matte directly from a mining process.\nThis makes up the balance of metal that has been used in product manufacturing over the \ngiven time-period.\nOur goal: Minimising our environmental footprint to \nprotect nature \nTotal hazardous waste produced\nThis KPI is a record of how much hazardous waste we generate from our operations that can \nno longer be used by Johnson Matthey and has to be sent off site for treatment. We define \nhazardous waste in line with local regulatory requirements in the particular territory where \nthe waste is generated. For example, in Europe we consider the EU Waste Framework \nDirective (Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council). We measure \nthe amount of solid and liquid hazardous waste and report in metric tonnes of material. \nWe measure the total weights sent off site, including any entrained water, and we consider \nall material waste no longer of use to Johnson Matthey. We categorise its destination in the \nfollowing ways:\n• Sent outside JM for beneficial reuse.\n• Sent outside JM for recycling.\n• Sent outside JM for incineration with energy recovery.\n• Sent outside JM for incineration or treatment without energy recovery.\n• Sent outside JM for landfill disposal.\nNet water usage\nThis KPI is a record of how much water we withdraw through our operations. \nThe KPI includes all freshwater sources – mains supplied water that we receive from \nmunicipalities, public or private utility companies, ground water that is extracted from below \nthe earth’s surface and fresh surface water that we extract from rivers, wet\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
