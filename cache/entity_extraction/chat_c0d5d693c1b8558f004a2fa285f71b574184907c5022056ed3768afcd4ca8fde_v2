The proposed tender date is in the best interests of shareholders \nand the Company as PwC has a detailed knowledge of our business, an understanding of our \nindustry, and continues to demonstrate that it has the necessary expertise and capability to \nundertake the audit.\nExternal audit plan\nIn developing the external audit plan for 2023, PwC carried out a risk assessment to identify \npotential risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. This risk assessment \nconsidered the nature, magnitude and likelihood of each identified risk, together with \nrelevant controls, to identify audit risks. Graham Parsons reviewed the plan with a fresh \nperspective on the risk assessment. PwC refer to key audit matters in the independent \nauditors’ report on pages 133 to 143, which formed the basis of the external audit plan. \nIn determining the scope of coverage, PwC considered management reporting, the group’s \nlegal entity structure, the 2022 financial results and the financial forecast for 2023. PwC set \nout details of the coverage and the agreed scope in the independent auditors’ report on page \n133. The methodology of assessing materiality was consistent with the prior year and agreed \nat approximately 5% of the three-year average profit before tax adjusted for loss on business \ndisposals, loss on significant legal proceedings, major impairment and restructuring charges.\nFollowing discussion and challenge, we concluded the proposed external audit plan was \nsufficiently comprehensive for the audit of the group’s accounts and approved the proposed fee.\nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 2023 101\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION\nAudit Committee Report continued\nHow we review PwC’s performance\nThroughout the year, we review the ongoing effectiveness and quality of PwC and the audit \nprocess. We look at several factors: the auditors’ reports to the Committee; Graham Parsons \nand the PwC team’s performance in and outside committee meetings; how the PwC team \ninteracts with and challenges management; and on PwC’s efforts at building relationships \nwith our Internal Audit team. We ensure that we spend sufficient time with the auditors \nwithout management present as part of our assessment.\nWe considered how PwC challenged management’s judgements and assumptions on matters \nhighlighted on pages 98 and 99, and asked PwC to confirm if those matters had been \naddressed correctly by management. Following detailed analysis of the assurance completed, \nPwC agreed with management’s judgements and assumptions.\nWe seek direct feedback from the independent Quality Review Partner to review its assessment \nof PwC’s key planning judgements and the execution of PwC’s response to significant risks and \nreporting. We also ask PwC to share with us the results of their internal quality inspections of the \naudit as well as those conducted by the FRC. In addition, we feel it is important to understand \nmanagement’s opinion of audit quality and effectiveness: the executive directors and senior \nmanagement complete a questionnaire on the external auditor each year.\nProvision of non-audit services\nOur Non-Audit Services Policy ensures the provision of non-audit services is no threat to PwC’s \nindependence and objectivity as an auditor. In accordance with the FRC’s Revised Ethical \nStandard 2019, the auditor can only provide additional services directly linked to the audit.\nOur policy sets out how approval should be obtained before PwC is engaged to provide a \npermitted non-audit service. Services likely to cost £25,000 or less must be approved by the \nChief Financial Officer; services likely to cost more than £25,000 but less than £100,000 must \nbe approved by the Committee Chair. Services likely to cost over £100,000 must be approved \nby the Committee.\nWe reviewed compliance with the Non-Audit Services Policy, the provision of non-audit \nservices, details of the non-audit services provided by PwC and associated fees. Audit-related \nassurance services reported as non-audit services related to the review of half-year financial \ninformation and reporting, amounting to £325,000, other non-audit services in the year \nwere £28,200, in total representing 8% of the audit fee, compared with audit fees of  \n£4.64 million. More information on fees incurred by PwC for non-audit services, as well as \nthe split between PwC’s audit and non-audit fees, are in note 4 to the accounts, on page 169.\nObjectivity and independence\nWe are responsible for monitoring and reviewing the objectivity and independence of PwC. \nWe considered the information provided by PwC, confirming that no PwC employees involved \nwith the audit have links or connections to JM, and that they complied with the FRC’s Revised \nEthical Standard. We conclude that PwC is independent.\nProposed re-appointment of PwC\nFollowing our assessment, we believe that PwC provides a robust audit and valuable technical \nknowledge and is free from third-party influence and restrictive contractual clauses. \nAs a result, we have included a resolution proposing PwC’s re-appointment as auditor and \nauthorised the Committee to determine PwC’s remuneration in our Notice of AGM.\nHow we gather feedback on the effectiveness of our \nexternal auditor and external audit process\nInformation provided by the auditor\n• Details on the audit plan delivery and any changes to the scope of work\n• Assurance on the operation of PwC’s audit quality control procedures and insight into \ntheir outcomes as they relate to the audit and key members of audit team\nManagement feedback\n• Survey of audit quality and effectiveness by executive\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
