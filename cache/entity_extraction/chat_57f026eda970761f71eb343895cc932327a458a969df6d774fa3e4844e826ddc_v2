The arrow Indicates that one is a reference for or input into the other.Key:\n*GFANZ uses the term “energy transition” to refer to a net-zero transition in which both private sector and public policy changes \nare early and ambitious, thereby limiting economic disruption related to the transition (e.g. mismatch between renewable energy \nsupply and energy demand). For reference, the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), which develops climate \nscenarios used by regulators and others, defines “orderly scenarios” as those with “early, ambitious action to a net-zero GHG \nemissions economy,” as opposed to disorderly scenarios (with “action that is late, disruptive, sudden and/or unanticipated”). In \nan orderly transition, both physical climate risks and transition risks are minimized relative to disorderly transitions or scenarios \nwhere planned emissions reductions are not achieved. This explanation applies to all mentions of the term “orderly transition” in \nthis document.\n39 The alliances are the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative (NZAM), the Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance (NZAOA), the Net-Zero \nBanking Alliance (NZBA), the Net Zero Financial Service Providers Alliance (NZFSPA), the Net-Zero Insurance Alliance (NZIA), the \nNet Zero Investment Consultants Initiative (NZICI), and the Paris Aligned Asset Owners (PAAO).\nCONTENTS  |  FINANCIAL INSTITUTION NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLANS — FUNDAMENTALS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND GUIDANCE\n6\nAs part of the 2022 work program, GFANZ developed a series of related tools, frameworks, and \nother resources to support transition planning across the financial sector, with the goal of financing \nand enabling the real-economy transition to net zero. Collectively, this work provides a framework \nto ensure that financial institutions’ net-zero transition plans are grounded in science and provide \nappropriate accountability.\nIn addition to this report on net-zero transition plans for financial institutions, this work includes:\nGuidance on Use of Sectoral Pathways for Financial Institutions , which provides a framework for \ncomparing and assessing sectoral pathways, to help financial institutions and other pathway users \nunderstand how pathways differ and evaluate their suitability for their transition planning processes. \nExpectations for Real-economy Transition Plans , which presents the expectations of net zero-\ncommitted financial institutions for real-economy companies’ transition plans, provides clarity \nregarding the landscape of existing guidance and methodologies, and outlines the components \nof real-economy transition plans and progress reporting most useful for financial institutions in \ntheir decision-making.\nAlso anticipated are Net-zero Pathways Analysis and Expectations for Transition Plans on specific \nsectors that will supplement the sectoral pathway and real-economy transition plan guidance. Each \nreport will take a deeper dive into the scenarios, modeling, assumptions, and decarbonization levers of \npathways for these sectors; key implications for financial institutions; and transition plan components \nand guidance specific to these high-emitting sectors. \nManaged Phaseout of High-emitting Assets , which sets out managed phaseout as a net zero-aligned \nstrategy for an asset, or as part of a company’s strategy, in support of an orderly and just transition. \nThe report provides a high-level approach to support the identification of assets where managed \nphaseout could be appropriate, offers an overview of potential financial mechanisms that could \nsupport managed phaseout, and includes initial guidance on the features of a credible asset-level \nphaseout plan.\nMeasuring Portfolio Alignment: Driving Enhancement, Convergence, and Adoption builds on the work \nof the Portfolio Alignment Team to provide a practitioner perspective for measuring the alignment of \nfinancial institution business activities with the goals of the Paris Agreement and net-zero objectives. \nThe report outlines enhanced guidance for designing, selecting, and implementing forward-looking \nportfolio alignment metrics, in addition to illustrative quantitative and practitioner use cases.\nCONTENTS  |  FINANCIAL INSTITUTION NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLANS — FUNDAMENTALS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND GUIDANCE\n7\nPART B\nNet-zero transition \nfor the financial sector\nCONTENTS  |  FINANCIAL INSTITUTION NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLANS — FUNDAMENTALS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND GUIDANCE\n8\nDefining transition finance\n40 In this report, “climate solutions” is used to refer to solutions that support mitigation of climate change and emissions reduction. \nGFANZ acknowledges that a broader use of the term may include solutions that are aimed at developing adaptation.\n41 In this report, unless specified, “assets” can refer to physical or financial assets or both depending on the application to various \nfinancial products, services, and business models. Physical assets are also known as tangible assets. For most businesses, physical \nassets usually refer to properties, equipment, and inventory. A financial asset is an asset that derives its value from a contractual \nright or ownership claim. Cash, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and bank deposits are all examples of financial assets.\n42 Bank of England Executive Director Sarah Breeden highlighted this risk in a speech .\nALIGNING THE FINANCIAL SECTOR WITH \nTHE NET-ZERO TRANSITION \nFinancial institutions have a vital role in supporting \nthe real economy by facilitating the allocation of \ncapital and providing related services.
