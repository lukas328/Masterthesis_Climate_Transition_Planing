the oldest and largest wind turbine manufacturer and servicer in \nthe world, we are a leading contributor to the decarbonisation of \nglobal energy demand �\nGenerating wind energy is one of the most carbon-efficient ways of \nproducing electricity � A single Vestas wind turbine generates around \n30 to 50 times more energy than it consumes during its lifecycle � \nThis offers enormous potential to reduce carbon emissions across \nthe global energy system �\nTo date, our total installed capacity of more than 164 GW globally \nhas helped to avoid 1� 9 billion tonnes of carbon emissions, equiva -\nlent to the CO2e emissions from 4 �5 billion barrels of oil � And we are \ncontinuing to scale this potential � In 2022, we increased our total \naggregate installed capacity by 8 percent compared with 2021� \nWe also calculate the amount of expected COe that will be avoided \nover the lifetime of the turbines produced and shipped in the year � In \n2022, the turbines we produced and shipped are expected to avoid \n408 million tonnes of CO 2e over their lifetime � This is calculated by \nfirst converting the MW of turbines installed into MWh per year, and \nthen multiplying by the average capacity factor of Vestas serviced \nwind farms, the expected lifetime of the turbine in years based on \nthe design criteria, and the global average emissions intensity of \nelectricity from the

procedures for \nthe approval of new chemicals � We also provide local instructions for \nhandling, transporting and storing chemicals, and a global chemical \ndatabase for sharing knowledge with suppliers �\nTo adapt to changing chemical legislation globally, such as GHS/CLP \nand REACH, we continuously update a central list of substances � \nThis list identifies chemicals that are prohibited around the world \nand restricts certain substances in our product manufacturing and \nservice processes �\nWe require our suppliers to fulfil the requirements set out in our \nprohibited and restricted substances management document for all \nproducts delivered � We also do not buy products containing \nprohibited substances � If a product contains restricted chemicals, \nthe supplier must perform health and safety evaluations to ensure \ncorrect use of the materials in question �\nFurthermore, we expect our suppliers to create action plans for \nphasing out these restricted substances and finding sustainable \nalternatives � In parallel with this process, we assess if a time-bound \ndispensation can be signed off and/or if the product can be \nsubstituted �\nTo avoid
