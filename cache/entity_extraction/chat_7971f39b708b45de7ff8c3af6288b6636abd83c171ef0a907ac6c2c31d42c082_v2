We used customer-level \nproduction capacity data to estimate production, based on average load factors from BEIS (percentage of time a \nplant runs through the year, based on supply/demand dynamics caused by dispatch costs and wholesale power \nprices). We then multiplied the resulting production with UK-level average emissions factors from BEIS (emissions \nper MWh of electricity generated by a particular technology, such as natural gas).\nIdentified renewables: Projects that generate electricity from renewable sources generate no Scope 1 emissions.\nRevenue intensity: Where emissions and production data are not available, we use revenue emissions intensities, \nthe PCAF database and revenue production intensity. Specifically, we multiply customer-level revenue by average \nrevenue intensity factors for power generation (emissions per £ of revenue). This assumes that all customers in the \nelectricity generation sector have similar cost/revenue structures and that the sector operates as a free market, \nabsent of monopoly rents. Average UK level statistics were used for estimating Scope 1 revenue intensity while \nPCAF revenue intensity estimates were used for estimating Scope 2 emissions.\nFor the electricity generation sector, physical emissions intensity is measured in units of kilogram of CO2 equivalent \nper megawatt hour (kgCO2e/MWh). To estimate the reduction in emissions intensity required by 2030, we used \nthe UK CCC BNZ scenario, which requires a 76% reduction in emissions intensity relative to a 2019 baseline. \nThe reduction in physical emissions intensity by 2030 has been validated by the SBTi as science-based.\nCCC estimates assume a decrease in carbon intensity of electricity generation in a phased manner with:\n • Focus during 2020-2030 on phase-out of coal-based electricity generation and deployment of \n low-cost renewables at scale;\n • Focus during 2030-2040 on displacement of unabated gas by 2035 with low carbon alternatives e.g. \nrenewables; and;\n • Operating a near-zero electricity system during the 2040s.\nEstimated emissions intensity (kgCO2e/MWH)\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n2019 2021 2025 2030 2035 2040 2045 2050\n2019 - 2020 NatWest Group estimates\n2021 NatWest Group estimate\nConvergence \npathway\nUK CCC \nBNZ Pathway\n2030 SBTi validated target\n2050 convergence point\n Under or equal to the convergence pathway  Above convergence pathway by up to 5%  Above convergence pathway by more than 5%\nEnergy \n2021 NatWest Group estimate - RAG status\n85NatWest Group plc | 2022 Climate-related Disclosures Report\nGovernance Strategy and Climate transition plan Risk Management and Scenario Analysis Metrics and TargetsIntroduction\nOil and gas\nSince 2019, absolute emissions have reduced by 69% reflecting reduced lending aligned with our climate ambition \nwith an aim to end harmful activities.\nIn addition to estimating Scope 1 and 2 emissions aligned with other sectors analysed, we have also estimated \nScope 3 financed emissions upstream activities related to extraction, as prescribed by the PCAF Standard on \nFinanced Emissions, as these activities have a high climate impact.\n • Emissions intensity was estimated by considering the location of main areas of operation for customers \nacross the Norwegian North Sea and five sub-regions of the North Sea. For each of these regions, the physical \nemissions intensity has been derived from publications of the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate and of the North \nSea Transition Authority. The estimated emissions intensity for NatWest Group was calculated as the weighted \naverage of the emissions intensity of each customer, based on its location of operation.\n • Our estimated Scope 3 financed emissions are calculated using the published Scope 3 emissions of our customers, \nwhile published emissions from the wider industry are used to calculate the industry revenue intensity. \n • We have used different pathways for Scope 1 and 2, and Scope 3 emissions as the underlying drivers for \nemissions generation, as well as for their reduction, are likely to be different.\n • We have used the UK CCC BNZ scenario to estimate physical emissions intensity reductions required by 2030 \nfor Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Scope 1 and 2 emissions arise from processes related to the supply of fuel e.g. \nextraction, production and related activities of oil and gas companies.\nWe have used IEA NZE scenario for Scope 3 emissions resulting from the downstream combustion of oil and gas.\nAs a result, while Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions may be reduced by adoption of more efficient production \nmethodologies, Scope 3 emissions reductions will require demand reduction through behavioural changes, \nfuel switching and electrification of combustion processes.\nNatWest Group aims to align its Scope 1, 2 and 3 portfolio temperature score by loan value from 3.2°C in 2019 \nto 2.3°C by 2030, as validated by the SBTi as science-based. The temperature rating estimate reflects potential \nwarming in 2100 above pre-industrial levels based on current emissions targets set by customers within the \nsectors covered by the assessment. Where available, we used GHG emissions reduction targets disclosed by \ncustomers through CDP to calculate temperature scores for each customer. Customers who did not have \nexternally disclosed targets through CDP were assigned a default score of 3.2°C.\nTargets set by customers are expected to become more ambitious, aligned with expected regulatory \ndevelopments\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
