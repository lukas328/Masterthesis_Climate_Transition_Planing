This \ntarget was aligned to the emissions pathway needed to keep \nthe global temperature rise below 1.5°C. It was formally \napproved by the SBTi in 2020.   \nIn 2020, JLL also signed the World Green Building Council  \nNet-Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment, pledging to  \nonly occupy offices which are net-zero carbon in operation  \nby 2030. \n \nRecognizing that bold and ambitious actions are required, \nin May 2021 JLL set a target to achieve net-zero emissions \nby 2040, encompassing our entire Greenhouse Gas (GHG) \ninventory. In a related move, JLL also signed The Climate \nPledge in May 2021, committing JLL to being net-zero by \n2040, ten years ahead of the Paris Agreement.  \nOn October 28, 2021, JLL’s net-zero 2040 target was certified \nby the SBTi to its new Net-Zero Standard.
