This is expected to give the \nworld a 50% chance of limiting global warming to 1.5°C in the year 2100, compared with pre-industrial \ntimes. Limiting global warming to 1.5°C would still lead to a warmer and more extreme climate than we \nexperience today. Letting the global temperature rise by more than 1.5°C will lead to even more drastic \nand unpredictable events; like flooding of major cities, mass migration from then-uninhabitable areas, or a \nlack of fresh water, to name a few. \nAlready as of today, more than 150 nations, covering around 90% of global population, emissions and GDP \nalike, have net-zero ambitions, including the US, the European Union (EU) and India. Within the United \nStates, 25 States and the District of Columbia have set concrete 2030 targets as well as other intermediate \ndecarbonization targets.2 The EU has set concrete decarbonization targets to be achieved by 2030. \nThe world will only meet these goals and commitments if governments follow through on the Paris \nAgreement ambition of 1.5°C with swift, stable, and reliable policies, action plans and regulations. \nGovernments have started translating their commitments into a range of legislation and initiatives. This \nincludes, for example: \n• sectoral transition plans and support schemes for low-carbon technology (such as the US Inflation \nReduction Act or the EU Fit for 55 Package), and \n• reporting and due diligence directives (like the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive \n(CSRD) and the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) which is currently under \ndevelopment). \n \n1 The last two sentences were added in February 2024 \n2 As of August 2022.

We are committed to \ntransitioning our proprietary investment and P&C underwriting portfolios to net-zero greenhouse gas \n(GHG) emissions by 2050 – consistent with a maximum temperature rise by the end of the century of 1.5°C, \ntaking into account the best available scientific knowledge, including the findings of the IPCC3 – and to net-\nzero GHG emissions by 2030 within our own operations. This is with the expectation that governments will \nfollow through on their own commitments to ensure the objectives of the Paris Agreement are met. \nWe seize opportunities to drive decarbonization and climate resilience through our resources, partnerships, \nexpertise, and influence. Our ambition is to be a trusted partner for our clients and investee companies \nacross different sectors in their transition toward net-zero. Our climate approach is grounded in the Allianz \nGroup Climate Change Strategy, which has been in place since 2005. With a special focus on UN \nSustainable Development Goal 13, Climate Action, we take into account climate risk and opportunity \nanalytics for our organization and across our business areas where we exercise decision-making and have \nalready taken significant steps in the past decade. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAs a key next step in our journey, we publish this Inaugural Net-Zero Transition Plan. It is informed \nespecially by the recommendations of the UN High-Level Expert Group on Net-Zero Commitments of Non-\nState Actors. \nTo substantiate our long-term net-zero commitments, we have set intermediary targets for 2025 for our \nproprietary investments. We are on a good track to achieving those targets along all levers.4  \nWith this Inaugural Transition Plan we are announcing our 2030 targets for proprietary investments \nand P&C underwriting in our commercial and motor retail businesses.  \nThe targets are informed by IPCC 1.5°C climate scenarios5 and by credible industry-led approaches, for \nexample the Target Setting Protocol of the Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance, which was named the “gold \nstandard for credible commitments and transparent targets” by UN Secretary-General António Guterres.6 \nWhen setting these portfolio targets, we are dependent on change in policy and the real economy to \nachieve them. \nTherefore, we are advocating for strong climate policy from governments across the globe. A supportive \npolicy environment is crucial to ensuring the viability of a socially just transition to climate resilience and \nnet-zero emissions. Without decisive and global action by governments, a 1.5°C trajectory is not \nachievable.7 \n \n3 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \n4 For more details please refer to our Group Sustainability Report 2022, chapter 02 – Link \n5 From IPCC’s 6th Assessment Report the so-called C1 scenario set with no or low overshoot of 1.5°C during the century; we used other \nscenarios such as the IEA’s Net-Zero by 2050, when IPCC did not provide the necessary granularity or data points. \n6 Source: Secretary-General’s remarks to Global Climate Action High-Level Event. \n7 More on our policy advocacy and related memberships can be found in our Group Sustainability Report chapter 03.2 – Link \nFigure 1: Key highlights of climate action at Allianz in past decade  \n\n \n \n \n 3/8 \n \nFor our 2030 targets for proprietary investments and P&C underwriting, we do not see a role for carbon \nremoval offsets.
