The UK Government’s policy to stop the sale of internal combustion engine \nvehicles increases the transition risk for the automotive manufacturing sector.\n • Within the water and waste sector, activities at heightened climate-related risk primarily relate to the waste sector. Greenhouse \ngas emissions from the waste sector mainly comprise methane released from landfill sites.\n • Within the industrials sector, activities related to the manufacturing of products is considered to be at heightened climate-related \nrisk than lending related to the purchase of machinery and equipment.\n • Heightened climate-related risk activities within the airlines and aerospace sector relate to lending to airlines and airline operators \nas emissions intensity for these activities are higher than upstream activities in the value chain resulting in higher exposure to \ntransition risk.\n • Within the leisure sector, heightened climate-related risk is related to activities which could potentially have high susceptibility to \nflood risk, as well as transition risk arising from changes in customer behaviour due to impacts of climate change.\n • Where activities in other sectors were assessed as being aligned to heightened climate-related risk sectors and subsectors \nidentified above, these were also classed as heightened climate-related risk.\nHeightened climate-related risk exposure\n • Total exposure to wholesale heightened climate-related risk sectors and portfolios increased by £1.5 billion (1.8%) during 2022. \nThese exposures represent around 34% of total wholesale lending exposure at 31 December 2022.\n • Total exposure to the oil and gas sector increased by £0.3(*) billion compared with 31 December 2021, primarily related to foreign \nexchange movements.\n • As at 31 December 2022 the exposure to oil and gas majors(3) amounted to £0.9(*) billion (31 December 2021 – £0.8 billion), \nrepresenting 25% of the total exposure to the oil and gas sector.\n • Exposure to coal customers, as defined in the Credible Transition Plan (CTP) assessment(3) completed in 2021, was £0.3 billion as \nat 31 December 2022 (£0.6 billion as at 31 December 2021).\n(*) Within the scope of EY assurance.
