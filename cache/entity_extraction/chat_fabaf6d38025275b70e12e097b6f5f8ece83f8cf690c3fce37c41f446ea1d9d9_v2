Where possible, \nwe are moving our offices onto renewable energy \nfrom credible sources. Where renewable energy is not \ndirectly available, we are purchasing Renewable Energy \nCertificates (RECs) or equivalents.\nWe will address any residual emissions through the \npurchase of high-quality carbon offsets, although we  \nintend to keep any such purchases to a minimum.\n1, 2, 3\n30,614\nOffice space \nOur partnership with our clients is fundamental to \ndelivering net-zero, as over 96% of our emissions arise \nfrom the consumption in those buildings we manage on \nbehalf of our clients. For JLL to be successful in achieving \nnet-zero by 2040, we need to support all clients in their \nown climate action journeys. These partnerships are a \nkey pillar of our business strategy. \nOur professionals offer advice on how sustainability \nconsiderations can be embedded across our services to \nmaximize value for our clients. Supporting this strategy is \nour commitment to training and upskilling our teams on \nsustainability related topics, including climate risk, green \nbuilding certifications, health and wellbeing, sustainable \ncities and more.

We keep evolving our \ninternal policies to eliminate unnecessary business travel. \nIf the travel is unavoidable, we direct employees to use less \nimpactful modes of transport wherever possible. In support \nof these policies, we continue to invest in technology \nsolutions and provide options to support flexible working \npractices. As part of our global real estate strategy, we \nprioritise office locations that are accessible by public \ntransportation to ensure our people can get to work in a \nway that is both low-cost and sustainable.\n3\n76,740\nBusiness travel  \nand hotel use\nOur Global Sustainable Procurement Framework will \ncontinue to be key to embedding sustainability across \nour extensive supply chain and demanding more from \nour contractors.

We will seek to minimize our use of offsets as far as is \npracticable. Within this threshold, and upon the achievement \nof our long-term target, any unabated emissions will be \nneutralized.
