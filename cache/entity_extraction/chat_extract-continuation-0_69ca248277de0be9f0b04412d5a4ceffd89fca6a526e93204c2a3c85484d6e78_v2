By creating a more focused \nportfolio with four business areas, we are driving value creation, taking a much more \ncustomer-centric approach in order to seize opportunities with a simplified operating model \nto drive execution. The Board’s challenge was how to measure and track progress, and I am \npleased that we are seeing strong performance, delivering against strategic milestones. \nThere is more information on this on page 13. \nWe are transforming our business at a time when our markets are coming at us faster than \never before. For example, the pace of decarbonisation activities in China have accelerated as \nit becomes the world’s biggest fuel cell market. The EU has adopted a climate law enshrining \nits new climate targets of at least a 55% reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions \nby 2030 compared to 1990 levels. And in the US, it is a completely changed regulatory \nlandscape. There has been a lot of noise about the Inflation Reduction Act – it’s quite simply \na global game-changer, offering $369 billion in subsidies.\nWe will always follow the markets and our customer demand – in the examples above, \nwe are developing partnerships, winning business and helping customers catalyse the net \nzero transition. I am confident that this will continue to grow over the coming years.\nShareholder engagement \nThis year, I have spent a significant amount of time talking to our shareholders about the \ndirection of travel. I am pleased that they support our vision, and we are aligned on our \nstrategic focus on the right growth markets. \nIn addition, we engaged Rothschilds to undertake an independent perception study with \ninvestors. The purpose was to understand investors’ perceptions of, and market sentiment \ntowards JM. The study included in-depth discussions with investors representing 33% of JM’s \nissued share capital and some of our core analysts. Covering strategy, business streams, \nmanagement, valuation and environmental, social and governance (ESG), the study has been \nhugely useful for the Board and showed that we are on track and delivering in the right areas.\nThe study also highlighted the needs of different shareholders, with long-term shareholders \nfocusing on our growth businesses and the future prospects of our Hydrogen Technologies \nand Catalyst Technologies businesses, while others are looking more for shorter-term \nperformance including the ongoing success of Clean Air. But overall, the main message \nis that we have the building blocks in place to reinvigorate the investment case, underpinned \nby strong synergies between our businesses. I am confident that over the coming months, \nwe will be able to show further strong evidence of delivery against our strategic milestones. \nWe really do understand the need to prove we can maximise shareholder value in the Clean \nAir business, including plans for site rationalisation. We are working on other efficiencies, \ntidying the portfolio and delivering cost efficiencies. I am sure that we have the right strategy \nin place to maximise shareholder value in both the short and long term.  \nBoard focus and changes \nI believe that the role of the Board is twofold: to constructively challenge, and encourage and \nsupport. The effectiveness of this approach could be viewed in how we navigated some of the \nchallenges this year, including the war in Ukraine, the energy crisis and inflationary pressures. \nChris Mottershead will be retiring from the Board in January 2024, and I would like to thank \nhim for all his hard work and dedication over the last eight years. With Chris’s departure, John \nO’Higgins will take over the role as Chair of the Remuneration Committee.  \nI am very pleased that in July, Barbara Jeremiah will be joining the board as Senior \nIndependent Director. Barbara brings strong leadership, deep understanding of metals, and \nhas extensive experience in North American markets which will be important for JM as the \ngroup evolves. \nFinally, I would like to take this opportunity to express my thanks to colleagues across the \nbusiness who are at the heart of our strategy. It is because of their tireless work that JM is \ntransforming into a company that is fit for the future and enabling our customers to catalyse \nthe net zero transition. \nPatrick Thomas\nChair\nChair’s statement\nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 2023 5\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION\nThe drivers  \nof our changing  \nworld\nThroughout the world, 2022/23 was marked by \nvolatility. But underneath the spikes in energy prices, \ninflation, conflict and extreme weather, there is \na deeper shift happening towards creating more \nsustainable ways of living. The transition to net zero \nrequires a range of technological innovations. From \nhydrogen fuel cells to sustainable chemical feedstocks, \nfrom new sustainable fuels to advanced emission \ncontrol solutions with circularity embedded – all have \nan important part to play in transforming energy, \nmobility and industrial systems.\nJohnson Matthey is not simply reacting to a changing \nworld; we are actively contributing to catalysing the net \nzero transition, providing solutions for our customers \nthat will have a positive impact.\nOur Materiality Statement\nJohnson Matthey’s sustainability framework and targets cover all ESG topics considered \nimportant by our stakeholders.
