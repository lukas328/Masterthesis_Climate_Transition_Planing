To support this, we are already increasing our manufacturing capability in the UK through a new 3GW \ngigafactory in Royston, UK. As part of this project and the scale-up of our manufacturing capabilities, there will \ninevitably be new opportunities created for our people to transfer to different roles as we refocus and redirect \ntheÂ group to support our strategic ambitions.  \nInvestors: Our long-term partnership with Plug Power is a key deliverable in our strategic growth plan for our \nHydrogen Technologies business. This partnership confirms our world-class position in catalyst coated \nmembranes, the key performance-defining components of electrolyzers and fuel cells. It further emphasises the \nkey role we have to play in the green hydrogen economy. The Board considered that this partnership would \npositively contribute to investorsâ long-term returns. \nCustomers and innovation partners: JM will become an important strategic supplier of MEA components, \nproviding a substantial portion of Plugâs demand for catalysts, membranes, and catalyst coated membranes. This \nis an incredibly important validation of our technology and our ability to deliver for our customers as we support \nthe rapid scale-up of key raw material value chains by contributing expertise in sourcing, managing and \nrecycling PGMs.\nGovernments and trade associations: A Â£400 million government-backed loan (unrelated to the Plug Power \npartnership) was granted to JM in April 2022. The long-term strategic plan for JMâs hydrogen products will \nfurther help to deliver the UK governmentâs Ten Point Plan for a green industrial revolution, to help develop \nglobal solutions to the climate crisis.\nCommunities: This partnership will contribute significantly towards our 2030 target for 50 million tonnes \nofÂ greenhouse gas emissions avoided per year. It will also help Plug Power meet its strategic ambitions, and \ntherefore will help its customers â including Amazon, Carrefour, Walmart and BMW â to meet their business \ngoals, helping to decarbonise the economy.\nOutcomes and impact on our long-term success\nThe partnership enables each company to leverage its specific areas of expertise, working together to accelerate \nitsÂ growth. It also delivers on a key strategic milestone for partnerships for Hydrogen Technologies and materially \naccelerates our ambition to be a leading provider of CCMs globally.\nThe partnership will support Plug Power in delivering its targeted revenue of US$5 billion and US$20 billion by \n2026 and 2030 respectively. To help achieve these targets, Plug Power and JM will co-invest in what is expected \nto be the largest (5GW scaling to 10GW over time) CCMs manufacturing facility in the world.  Plug Power and \nJMÂ will also continue to leverage government incentives where possible, including from the Inflation Reduction \nAct in the US and REPowerEU in Europe to push for exponential growth across the hydrogen industry.\nInvesting in our future and securing our  \nleadership position\nWe are investing for growth and generating attractive returns. As part of our plans to invest Â£1.1 billion in \ncapital expenditure from 2022/23 to 2024/25, the Board approved several investments to expand and improve \nour existing infrastructure in a number of our businesses. \nThe Board approved a gigafactory to scale up the manufacture of hydrogen fuel cell components. \nTheÂ gigafactory will initially be capable of manufacturing 3GW of proton exchange membrane components \nannually for hydrogen vehicles and the project is supported by the UK government through the Automotive \nTransformation Fund.\nIn PGMS, our refineries need investment to set them up for decades of profitable operation. This year \nweÂ continued to invest to maintain these assets.\nStakeholder considerations\nOur people: Old equipment, challenging conditions and increasingly unreliable assets posed potential EHS risks \nand placed a strain on our operations, engineering and maintenance teams. We considered the potential \nbenefits to our people, and the invaluable impact replacing the existing metals refinery would have on the \nworking environment and safety. \nIn addition, we considered the positive impacts of scaling up our operations in Hydrogen Technologies and \ntheÂ role it would play in securing hundreds of highly skilled manufacturing jobs in the UK.\nInvestors and customers: The scale-up of manufacturing for hydrogen fuel cell components will position \nJohnson Matthey to be a market leader in performance components for fuel cells and electrolysers, driving \nlong-term value creation for our investors and the improvement of the electric vehicle supply chain for \nourÂ customers. \nThe age of the existing refinery and machinery could cause regular issues and delays in refining customer metal, \nresulting in longer lead times and working capital constraints. The new refinery will increase refining capacity, \nreduce working capital, and therefore create new commercial opportunities for us. It will bring innovation to our \nrefining processes, including more automation and control systems to optimise the way in which the plant is run \nand drives circularity for our customers.\nCommunity and society: Decarbonising freight transformation is critical to help societies and industries meet \ntheir ambitious net zero emission targets. Our investment into fuel cells will be a crucial part of this transition. \nThe 3CR project will have significant environmental and social benefits over the existing refinery. It will \nfuture-proof the plant against potential tightening of legislation around platinum salts sensitisation through \nengineering-based controls and containment. 3CR will also deliver energy efficiency and sustainability \nimprovements, including the reduction of hazardous waste, moving us towards our 2030 targets including \nScope 1 + 2 emissions.\nOutcomes and impact on our long-term success\nThe scale-up of manufacturing for hydrogen fuel cell components positions us as a market leader in \nperformance components for fuel cells and electrolysers, targeting more than Â£200 million sales in Hydrogen \nTechnologies by\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
