For more information, please see the \nPCAF manual (page 51) (available at:  https: //carbonaccountingfinancials.com/en/standard).\n13 PCAF recommends measuring residential emissions based on household energy consumption, considering the Brazilian energy matrix (score 4 considers the use of this information and the adoption of an average emission factor, given the size of the property).  \nFor vehicles, PCAF indicates that emissions be calculated based on the model and fuel consumption (we adopt a score of 4 for contracts in which the PCAF provides an emission factor suitable for the type, brand and model of the financed vehicle; on the other hand, \na score 5 is used when we adopt an average emission factor per type of vehicle (passenger, bus or truck). \nLoan portfolio - individuals\nWe also expanded the coverage of the calculation of financed emissions coverage including loan operations and financing \nfor individuals. \nAs for emissions from vehicle financing for individuals, we adopted the methodology for the “Motor Vehicle Loans” asset class, \nwith calculation methods score 4 and 513\n56 \nItaú Unibanco Holding S.A.climate report 2022\nemissions calculation methodology\nThe PCAF methodology covers the measurement of emissions from seven asset categories , which can be measured using five methods, depending on the availability of our clients’ data (each \nmethod has a score, one being the best and five being the worst).  The greater the availability of data from our clients, the greater the accuracy of this calculation \nWe keep interacting with PCAF to help improving financed emissions calculation methodologies.  We will also work on expanding the coverage of portfolios considered in the baseline, to include \nnew assets with methodology under development, such as sovereign bonds.  We will make the necessary retroactive adjustments in subsequent assessments to ensure transparency and \ncomparability. \nGHG emissions by sector of activity, asset class and region14 \nGHG emissions intensity, by \nsector of activity (iSector)\nFinanced emissions (scopes 1 + 2) Portfolio Relative emissions (scopes 1 + 2/ portfolio)\n (millions of metric tons of CO₂eq) (R$ billions) (MM tCO₂e/R$ bilhões)\n2020 2021 2022 2020 2021 2022 2020 2021 2022\nAgribusiness 3.9 4.3 5.0 21.8 30.2 33.9 0.177 0.143 0.148\nOil and gas 1.1 1.2 2.0 12.6 12.6 16.8 0.087 0.092 0.118\nCommerce 1.3 1.4 1.9 80.9 96.0 114.3 0.016 0.014 0.017\nEnergy 1.3 1.5 1.6 26.8 28.8 42.0 0.048 0.051 0.039\nIndustry - sundry 0.6 1.2 1.4 15.7 18.6 19.7 0.041 0.063 0.073\nTransportation 0.9 2.1 1.2 30.3 35.8 33.8 0.030 0.059 0.036\nCement 0.5 0.8 0.9 1.3 1.4 3.1 0.385 0.526 0.296\nPetrochemicals and chemicals 0.9 0.8 0.8 14.5 13.9 15.0 0.060 0.058 0.055\nServices - sundry 1.1 0.8 0.8 63.3 64.6 58.0 0.017 0.012 0.013\nFood and beverages 0.6 0.7 0.7 24.9 28.2 30.6 0.023 0.025 0.024\nMetallurgy, and steel and iron 0.7 0.7 0.7 9.0 10.6 9.9 0.077 0.068 0.067\nPulp and paper 0.2 0.2 0.3 3.0 6\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
