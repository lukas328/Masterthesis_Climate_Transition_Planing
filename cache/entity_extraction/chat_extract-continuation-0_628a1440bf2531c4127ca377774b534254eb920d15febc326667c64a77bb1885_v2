These deposits are repayable at any \ntime when the resident leaves the facility and are therefore not discounted. The deposits are recorded as the \nproceeds received, net of amounts deducted at the election of the resident. \nBupa Annual Report 2022 179 \n    \n                \n                  \n                   \n               \n                       \n              \n     \n      \n                  \n                 \n          \n           \n \n \n       \n      \n     \n     \n       \n                         \n       \n                 \n                    \n                 \n       \n \n \n   \n \n   \n             \n          \n             \n          \n       \n        \n                  \n                 \n        \n                    \n                     \n                    \n                   \n \n          \n      \n   \nStrategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements \nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \ncontinued \n(b) Occupational right agreement liabilities \nOccupational right agreement liabilities represent the amount payable to a resident on termination of the resident's \noccupation rights to an independent living unit in a retirement village in New Zealand or Australia. The liability \nvaries according to the agreement with the resident. Changes in the value of the liability are recorded as an \nexpense in the Consolidated Income Statement. Residents have the right to cancel their residency agreement \nwith the Group at any time. As such, the liability is not discounted but is recognised as a current liability in the \nConsolidated Statement of Financial Position. Occupational right agreement liabilities are held net of deferred \nmanagement fees and amenities fees receivable. \n(c) Deferred income and deferred revenue \nThe total balance of £107m (2021: £116m) includes £79m (2021: £81m) of deferred revenue under IFRS 15, related \nprimarily to care home government funding received in advance. The liability is released and recognised as revenue \nas the services are provided and the performance obligations are satisfied. \nChanges in this deferred revenue balance during the year are as follows: \n2021 \n2022 restated¹ \n£m £m \nAt beginning of year 81 74 \nRevenue recognised (390) (356) \nRevenue deferred 384 366 \nForeign exchange 4 (3) \nAt end of year 79 81 \n1. A correction has been made to the 2021 revenue recognised in the period and deferred revenue in the period, increasing the balances by £201m to \nreflect the gross up of government funding received. \nRevenue recognised includes £75m (2021: £65m) of revenue that was deferred at the beginning of the year. \n£72m (2021: £75m) of revenue deferred as at 31 December 2022 will be recognised during 2023 as the \nperformance obligations are satisfied. £7m (2021: £6m) of revenue deferred as at 31 December 2022 will \nbe recognised over the remaining contract period. \nNote 22: RT1 notes in brief \nRestricted Tier 1 \nThe RT1 notes meet the classification of equity and are presented as a \nseparate category of equity in the Consolidated Statement of Financial \n(RT1) notes \nPosition at an amount equal to the proceeds of issue less transaction costs. \nRT1 coupons are recognised directly in the Consolidated Statement of \nChanges in Equity, net of tax, upon payment. \n2022 2021 \n£m £m \nRestricted Tier 1 notes 297 297 \nOn 24 September 2021, Bupa Finance plc issued £300m of RT1 notes with a fixed coupon of 4.000% paid \nsemi-annually in arrears. Transaction costs of £3m were recognised in respect of the issue. The total coupon \npaid during the year was £12m (2021: £nil). \nThe RT1 notes are perpetual, with no fixed maturity or redemption date. The notes have a first call date of \n24 March 2032 and interest is payable at the sole and absolute discretion of Bupa Finance plc, with cancelled \ninterest providing no rights to the holder of the notes nor being considered a default. The RT1 notes are therefore \ntreated as equity.
