TCFD: The Group BPCE Climate Report , October 2021, p. 45.\nNatixis Corporate and Investment Banking (CIB), a subsidiary of the French banking group Groupe BPCE, has \ndeveloped a dedicated tool to support climate-related decision-making. Groupe BPCE is gradually extending this \nwork to cover all its lending portfolios (excluding the financial sector and sovereign issuers).\nThe Green Weighting Factor (GWF) tool assigns a climate rating to assets, financed products, or borrowers. It is \na seven-level color rating resulting from an assessment of the climate impact of the transaction, incorporating \nenvironmental externalities. The bank assesses indicators on water, biodiversity, waste, and air pollution, \nthough the weighting of each metric depends on the sector or project. This proprietary tool enables systematic \nintegration of climate change in CIB financing activities and is described in the Groupe BPCE 2021 TCFD Report. 121 \nA GWF rating is assigned whenever credit is granted, and the rating is reviewed regularly. Natixis CIB uses the \nGWF tool to measure and steer its share of balance sheet assets that are most exposed to transition risk. All \n“green” financing is assigned a reduction in analytical risk-weighted assets of up to 50% for the greenest. This \nmetric is increased by up to 24%, however, for financing that has a negative impact on the climate. By adjusting \nthe expected return on each loan according to its environmental and climate impact, teams are encouraged to \nfavor green financing solutions (for an equivalent level of credit risk). The tool was also used in the decision to exit \nclient relationships that had no potential to become aligned with net-zero objectives. 122 \nThe tool has been in use for more than two years, and ratings fluctuate as both the methodology and client \ndisclosure evolve. While it took time to fully implement and train employees, the GWF is now fully deployed and \ntargets have been set for every CIB line of business. Senior management emphasizes the importance of the GWF, \nwhich has also been integrated into CIB’s Risk Appetite Framework.  \nFigure 14. The Groupe BPCE Climate Report, October 2021 123\n– 44 – – 45 –\nMETRICS & TARGETS\nGroupe BPCE is now in a position to measure the carbon \nintensity of its portfolios potentially having the most sig-\nnificant climate impact and to manage their alignment \nwith a Net Zero trajectory. The Green Evaluation Models \napproach, which broadens the scope of these measures \nto the portfolios of the retail banks, will be rolled out for \nall its financing portfolios by 2024. \nThe Group uses these ratings and measurements of global \nwarming trajectories to:\n• Engage a strategic dialogue with customers and struc-\nture the sustainable financial products resulting from \nthis dialogue, \n• Manage the portfolios in an active manner,\n• Implement a strategic business planning system in line \nwith its commitments including – as far as the customer \nranking is concerned – the definition of priorities and iden-\ntification of sustainable financing opportunities,\n• Steer the portfolios into alignment with a 1.5°C trajectory.\nAlignment of the Natixis CIB portfolio\nFrom climate impact to the trajectory of portfolio alignment for the Corporate & Investment Banking division using the GWF\n41%\n28%\n31% 27%\n21%\n52%\n3.2°C in 2020 2.5°C in 2024 2.2°C in 2030\nAchievement of\na 1.5°C trajectory\nfor the balance\nsheet by 2050\n€115bn in outstandings \nexcluding the financial sector\nand loans to sovereign borrowers\nTargets broken down by sector,\nbusiness line and geography\n(EMEA, APAC, Americas)\nGWF color mix,\n% of outstanding\nloans\n2020 2025 2030 2035 2040 2045 2050\n1.5°C\n2°C\n2.5°C\n3°C\nAn initial milestone for the alignment of financing portfolios with a 2.5°C trajectory \nas early as 2024\n“The fight against climate change is central to \nour business model geared in favor of value cre-\nation.
