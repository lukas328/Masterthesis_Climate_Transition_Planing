Additional management actions would allow downside \nimpacts to be further mitigated by reducing expenditure, obtaining additional funding or divesting investments \nor businesses. \nDetails of the Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, \nperformance and position, are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 1-48. The financial position of the Group, \nits cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Financial Review on pages 9-12. The \nDirectors’ assessment of the Group’s longer-term viability over a three-year period is described on pages 98-99. \n1.5 Restatements and changes in accounting policies \nExcept for the changes detailed in (a) below, the Group has consistently applied its accounting policies to all \nperiods presented in these Consolidated Financial Statements. \n(a) IFRS Interpretations Committee decision Demand Deposits with Restrictions on Use \narising from a Contract with a Third Party (IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows) \nIn March 2022, the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) published its final agenda decision Demand Deposits \nwith Restrictions on Use arising from a Contract with a Third Party (IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows). This agenda \ndecision considered whether an entity should include a demand deposit as a component of cash and cash \nequivalents in its statement of cash flows and financial position when the demand deposit is subject to contractual \nrestrictions on use agreed with a third party. \nThe IFRS IC concluded that restrictions on the use of a demand deposit arising from a contract with a third party \ndo not result in the deposit no longer being cash unless those restrictions result in the deposit no longer meeting \nthe definition of cash. A deposit still meeting this definition would be presented as part of cash and cash \nequivalents on the statement of financial position, although it could be presented separately if relevant to an \nunderstanding of an entity's financial position. Such a deposit would also be considered part of cash and cash \nequivalents on the statement of cash flows. \nThe Group has reviewed the nature of its restricted assets and concluded that certain amounts should be \nconsidered part of cash and cash equivalents on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The Consolidated \nStatement of Cash Flows for the year ended 2021 has therefore been restated, resulting in an increase in the cash \nand cash equivalents at the beginning of the year of £100m and an increase in the cash and cash equivalents at \nthe end of the year of £112m. Cash held in restricted assets has been decreased by £12m. \nThis restatement had no impact on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. All restricted assets continue \nto be presented separately on the face of the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. \n(b) Other \nA number of other amended standards and interpretations became applicable for the current reporting period. \nThe Group did not have to change its accounting policies or make retrospective adjustments as a result of \nadopting these amendments. \nBupa Annual Report 2022 128 \n      \n                \n                 \n   \n                  \n                   \n                 \n              \n               \n                 \n               \n        \n                     \n                \n                  \n                 \n               \n               \n       \n                \n                      \n                    \n                \n                    \n                  \n                  \n     \n                 \n               \n                  \n                  \n                  \n                \n              \n               \n                  \n                  \n                \n                     \n                    \n                   \n                \n                 \n                 \n                  \n                    \n   \n                 \n                \n                 \n               \n              \n                   \n                 \n                  \n             \n                 \n                  \n              \n          \n      \n   \nStrategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements \nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \ncontinued \n1.6 Forthcoming financial reporting requirements \nA number of financial reporting standards, amendments and interpretations have been issued but are not effective \nfor the year ended 31 December 2022 and have not been early adopted by the Group. These include: \n(a) IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts \nIFRS 17 Insurance Contracts was issued in May 2017 as a replacement for IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts, with \namendments to IFRS 17 issued in June 2020 and December 2021. The final standard is effective for annual periods \nbeginning on or after 1 January 2023. IFRS 17 requires a current measurement model where estimates are \nremeasured each reporting period. Under the general measurement model (GMM), contracts are measured using \nthe building blocks of discounted probability-weighted cash flows, an explicit risk adjustment, and a contractual \nservice margin (CSM) representing the unearned profit of the contract which is recognised as revenue over the \ncoverage period. An optional, simplified premium allocation approach (PAA), similar in nature to the Group’s \nexisting measurement basis, is permitted for eligible short-duration contracts. \nIFRS 17 is an insurance standard and although the definition of insurance risk is the same as under IFRS 4, the \ncriteria allowing contracts to be dealt with under another standard are more stringent and therefore additional \nbusiness may fall within the scope of IFRS 17. The Group has reviewed contracts issued to customers by non-\ninsurance businesses against the definition of insurance risk within IFRS 17. Where there are contract features that \ncould indicate the transfer of insurance risk, management has reviewed and considered detailed contract terms \nand analysed supporting profitability data. The Group has concluded that no additional contracts are brought \ninto scope on adoption of IFRS 17. \nIn applying the standard, Bupa has reviewed the Group’s insurance and reinsurance contracts and considered the \ncontract boundary for each type of policy. The majority of policies have a coverage period of one year or\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>RCF<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The RCF (Revolving Credit Facility) is a financial arrangement that provides the Group with liquidity support, allowing it to draw funds as needed under specified covenants and stressed scenarios)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Group is a business entity engaged in various activities, managing liquidity, investments, and compliance with financial covenants, with detailed financial and strategic reporting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IFRS INTERPRETATIONS COMMITTEE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The IFRS IC is a standard-setting body that issues interpretations and decisions related to International Financial Reporting Standards, influencing how entities account for certain financial transactions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUPA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Bupa is a healthcare group that prepares financial statements, adopts IFRS standards, and reports on its financial position, policies, and future reporting requirements)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FINANCIAL POSITION<|>EVENT<|>The financial position refers to the overall financial health of the Group, including cash flows, liquidity, and borrowing facilities, as described in the financial review)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CASH FLOWS<|>EVENT<|>The cash flows detail the movement of cash within the Group, including the impact of restricted assets and restatements following IFRS IC decisions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIQUIDITY POSITION<|>EVENT<|>The liquidity position indicates the Group's ability to meet short-term obligations, influenced by its cash and cash equivalents, including adjustments for restricted assets)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ACCOUNTING POLICIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Group's accounting policies are the principles and standards applied consistently across periods, with recent changes due to IFRS interpretations and amendments)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IFRS 17 INSURANCE CONTRACTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>IFRS 17 is a new international accounting standard for insurance contracts, replacing IFRS 4, requiring current measurement models and affecting how insurance-related activities are reported, effective from January 2023)\n##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
