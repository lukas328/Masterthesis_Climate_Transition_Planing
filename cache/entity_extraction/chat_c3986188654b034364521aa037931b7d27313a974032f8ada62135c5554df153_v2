It is \nestimated that decarbonization in the world \nrequires investments of USD275 trillion until \n2050, more than 8% of annual world GDP , in \nclean energy, new materials, infrastructure, \nagricultural technologies, CO2 capture and \nstorage, etc1. \nClimate change presents short, medium \nand long-term risks for the Group and its \ncustomers, and these risks are expected \nto increase over time. Thus, the Group’s \nactivities or those of its customers could be \nnegatively affected by transition risks (those \nlinked to the transition to a low-carbon \neconomy in response to climate change) \nand physical risks (due to greater frequency \nand severity of meteorological phenomena \nextremes or long-term weather changes).\n1. Source: “The net-zero transition: What it would cost, what it could \nbring” , McKinsey & Company, 2022.\nAny of these factors could negatively affect \nthe financial situation of the Group. Aware of \nthis risk, BBVA is developing methodologies \nto understand and integrate said climate \nrisk into its business models. At the same \ntime, there are a series of opportunities \nassociated with climate change that BBVA \nis very aware of in order to take advantage \nof and position itself correctly in light of the \nsignificant disruption it entails.\nClimate change and the transition to a \nlow-carbon economy have significant \nimplications for the value chains of most \nproductive sectors, since they require \nsignificant investments in many industries. \nAs a financial institution, BBVA has an \nindirect impact on the environment and \nsociety through its lending activity and the \nprojects it finances.\nCustomers, markets and society as a \nwhole not only expect large companies to \ncreate value, but also expect them to make \na positive contribution to society and that \nthe economic development to which they \ncontribute through their financial activity is \ninclusive and contributes to a just transition.\nThat said, the investment needed to \nmake the world go zero emissions has \nto be attractive, economically viable and \nprofitable. In this sense, investment in \nrenewables, energy efficiency or electric \ncars already has a profitable alternative \nfor families and companies, compared to \nfossil fuels. However, most activities do \nnot have an emission-free version that is \neconomically viable.\nBBVA aims to gradually align its business to \na zero net emissions scenario by 2050 and \nto use its role as a bank to help its customers \nwith finance, advice and innovative solutions \nin the transition towards a more sustainable \nfuture inspired by the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals. \nP.  15\nBBVA Report on TCFD 2022\nThis English version is a translation of the original in Spanish for information purposes only.
