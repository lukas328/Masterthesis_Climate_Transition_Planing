This may result \nin a variation in financed emissions from year-to-year as a result of customer drawdowns and repayments.\n • Susceptibility to variation year-on-year: As noted previously, we use customer emissions, production and \nrevenue data to estimate financed emissions. Customer revenue and production are susceptible to change \nfor various reasons including most recently, the impact of COVID 19, as well as consolidation in the sector, \nchanging supply/demand market conditions, new entrants, and changes in the policy or funding environment \nresulting in variation in NatWest Group financed emissions year-on-year. As customers’ disclosures develop \nto include their emissions, the reliance on other metrics will reduce. In the meantime, variation in our financed \nemissions may not always reflect changes in customers’ emissions, but could result from changes in other \nfactors used to estimate emissions in the absence of externally published emissions by customers.\n • Emissions intensities reflect averages for the sector: Emissions intensity estimates are not comparable \nacross different financial institutions as they are based on data related to NatWest Group customers and \nmay be higher or lower than the average across other financial institutions.\n • Double counting of Scope 3: Scope 3 emissions represent emissions across the value chain for a given sector \nincluding upstream emissions, such as in processing the rare earth metals which go into the electronics in a \nwind turbine and downstream emissions such as emissions from losses in the power grid during operation of the \nwind turbine. Our disclosure of Scope 3 emissions is currently limited to just the oil and gas extraction, \nautomotive manufacture and land transport sectors. However, it is a known issue of the methodology that \n‘double counting’, whereby the Scope 1 or 2 emissions for a given sector may correspond to Scope 3 for \nanother sector, which uses the outputs of the first sector as an input, cannot be entirely avoided since the \nallocation of emissions in the potential overlap is difficult to estimate. As a result there is a likelihood of double \ncounting of Scope 3 emissions where our customers could be in the same value chain as other NatWest Group \ncustomers. Currently, our customers do not disclose who their suppliers or customers would be, thus making \nthe identification of potential double counting of our Scope 3 emissions very difficult - and the possibility of \ndouble counting likely.\n • Scope 3 definition differences: Definition of Scope 3 applied by customers within a sector may include \ndifferent activities. This could result in variation in Scope 3 emissions reported by customers within the same \nsector. Limitations regarding Scope 3 emission estimates are noted in the PCAF Standard: \"PCAF acknowledges \nthat, to date, the comparability, coverage, transparency, and reliability of Scope 3 data still varies greatly per \nsector and data source”.\nWe will continue to work with customers to encourage them to publish emissions disclosures. In ‘A roadmap \nto mandatory climate-related disclosures’ (November 2020), Her Majesty’s Treasury (HMT) set out regulators’ \nintentions to require mandatory TCFD climate-related disclosures across the UK economy by 2025. In addition, \nfrom February 2022, the FCA Policy Statement on ‘Proposals to enhance climate-related disclosures by listed \nissuers and clarification of existing disclosure obligations’ introduced new Listing Rules that require commercial \ncompanies with a UK premium listing to make climate-related disclosures, consistent with TCFD, on a ‘comply or \nexplain’ basis. Further, as of 5 April 2022, The Companies (Strategic Report) (Climate-related Financial Disclosure) \nRegulations 2022 were published, which make climate-related financial disclosures mandatory for certain publicly \nquoted companies, banks, insurance companies and large private companies. These legal and regulatory \nexpectations will help enhance the quality of emissions data available for use by NatWest Group to estimate \nour financed emissions.\nEstimates of financed emissions continued\n81NatWest Group plc | 2022 Climate-related Disclosures Report\nGovernance Strategy and Climate transition plan Risk Management and Scenario Analysis Metrics and TargetsIntroduction\nEstimates of financed emissions continued\nPages 82 to 87 include details on methodologies used to estimate financed emissions for sectors analysed. Also included are graphs for each sector which show the (i) external scenario pathway \n(ii) estimated convergence points for 2020, 2021, 2030 and 2050 based on a 2019 baseline; (iii) NatWest Group estimated physical emissions intensity for 2019, 2020 and 2021 and (iv) an assessment \nof NatWest Group 2021 estimates and the 2021 converge points.\nResidential mortgages\nResidential mortgages\nResidential mortgages comprise 46% of the NatWest Group loans and advances at 31 December 2021 (31 December \n2019 44%). Since 2019, absolute emissions have increased by 2% while physical emissions intensity decreased slightly \nover the same period, reflecting the continued focus on customer transition and improvement in EPC ratings since 2019, \nand improvement in the availability of EPC data.\nTo estimate financed emissions, we used both EPC ratings and original Loan to Value (LTV) in line with  \nthe PCAF Standard.\n • EPC data is an estimate of the underlying climate impact. EPC data is sourced from publicly available information. As \nEPC ratings only need to be updated every 10 years or after significant retrofits, at the point of sale or if leased, not \nall properties have current EPC ratings. Refer to section 5.2 for details on EPC data sourcing and limitations. Where \nEPC data is not available, a scaling factor is applied to estimate absolute emissions and floor space.
