Financial institutions should consider other sectors for Scope 3 that are \nproportionally material to their financed emissions and where data allows. Financial institutions should also refer to their sector-\nspecific alliance for guidance. ( NZAOA. Target Setting Protocol Second Edition ).\n244 Recall that this report uses “financed emissions” and “portfolio emissions” interchangeably.\nzero Transition Plans — Supplemental Information \nreport. However, these challenges are not a reason \nto delay target setting or measurement, and the \nrapid evolution and direction of travel of data \navailability and measurement methodologies may \ninform selection of metrics and targets. \nIn addition, GFANZ recognizes that Scope 3 \nemissions of clients and portfolio companies are \ncritical for financial institutions to evaluate in their \nmetrics and target setting. Many regulators and \nindustry bodies have highlighted the importance of \nincluding Scope 3 financed emissions. 243, 244\nFinancial institutions should take care to set and \nuse various metrics and targets appropriately. \nMetrics and targets can be used for multiple \npurposes, such as signaling commitment to net \nzero; driving action inside an institution; increasing \nunderstanding of client and portfolio company \nplans; and driving financing to real-economy \ntransition activities. \nTHEME\nMetrics and Targets\nMetrics and targets provide credibility and clarity when financial institutions communicate their net-zero \nstrategy to internal and external stakeholders. Quantitative metrics and targets are necessary to ground \nnet-zero ambition in specific objectives and concrete actions, and to track progress over time. Well-\nformulated targets allow for the assessment of an organization’s long-term decarbonization strategy, as \nwell as its interim activities and results. The appropriate metrics and targets for a given financial institution \nwill depend on its overall objectives and priorities. This theme focuses on the selection and use of metrics \nand targets.\nRecommendation\nEstablish a suite of metrics and targets to drive \nexecution of the net-zero transition plan and \nmonitor progress of results in the near, medium, \nand long term. Include metrics and targets \nfocused on aligning financial activity in support \nof the real-economy net-zero transition; on \nexecuting the transition plan; and on measuring \nchanges in client and portfolio GHG emissions.\n1) COMPONENT: METRICS AND TARGETS \nCONTENTS  |  FINANCIAL INSTITUTION NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLANS — FUNDAMENTALS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND GUIDANCE\n78\nLast, some essential transition actions, like \nsupporting firms in the early stages of transition or \nfunding the managed phaseout of high-emitting \nphysical assets, may result in increased financed \nemissions in the near term but contribute to \nmeaningful decreases in the medium or long term. \nTo capture this progress for both interim and \nlong-term targets, financial institutions may use \nmultiple metrics to gain a better understanding of \nthe effectiveness of a net-zero transition plan as \na whole.\nGreenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, \nmethane, and nitrous oxide, should be \nconsidered within GHG metrics and targets. 245\nGuidance: \nGeneral guidance \nSelection and calculation of metrics and targets \nshould be aligned with financial sector guidance \nto support transparency and comparability. \nInstitutions should regularly review targets \naccording to their sector-specific guidance; when \n245 IPCC.

Common timelines facilitate \njoint reviews by the Board (or equivalent body) \nand senior management committees and create \nopportunity for joint consideration of all business \nstrategies and priorities.\nWhere available, to provide stakeholders with \nindependent assurance that targets and data are \ncredible, financial institutions should consider \nseeking external validation for their GHG emissions \ntargets from third parties.\nFinancial institutions are encouraged to set and \nmonitor progress toward a net-zero emissions \nreduction target on their own operational and \ncorporate value chain emissions, in addition to their \nfinanced emissions, to which this report applies. 246 \nBOX 7. CONSIDERATIONS FOR ABSOLUTE AND INTENSITY METRICS247 \nA key design choice in selecting emissions and portfolio alignment metrics and targets is whether to \nbase these on measures of absolute emissions, or some form of intensity ratio. \nAbsolute emissions metrics may offer the benefit of a direct link to the carbon budget and can also \nbe applied consistently across sectors. However, they can discourage the transformation needed. \nAbsolute metrics may disincentivize investment in transition sectors, constrain growth of low-\nemissions entities, and make comparability of different-sized portfolios or entities difficult. \nAn economic intensity metric, based on a simple calculation (e.g., emissions/revenue) can address  \nsome of the challenges above. They allow for growth, investment, and comparability across sectors  \nMETRICS AND TARGETS\nCONTENTS  |  FINANCIAL INSTITUTION NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLANS — FUNDAMENTALS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND GUIDANCE\n79\nand portfolios.
