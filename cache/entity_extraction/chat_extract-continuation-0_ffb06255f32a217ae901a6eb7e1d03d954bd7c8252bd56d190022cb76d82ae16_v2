In relation to the \nissue of water resources, BRF is structured to comply with \nthe specific requirements to the regions where it operates \nand has established a target of reducing its consumption \nin industrial operations by 13% by 2025.\nThe recycling and reuse of water are fundamental to this \nstrategy. At the Bandirma (Turkey) and Abu Dhabi (United \nArab Emirates) plants, around 27% of the amount of water \nconsumed is already sourced from a reuse system. In the \nBrazilian operations, this percentage rose from 11% in \n2020 to 15% in 2022, and it keeps growing.\nDuring 2022, a total of 55,682.40 ML of water was \nwithdrawn for BRF’s activities. This amount, that takes into \nconsideration all of the Company’s units, fell by 10.7% \ncompared to 2021. Another development that has taken \nplace since 2020 has been the reduction by 4.29% in the \nindicator demonstrating the amount of water consumed \nper ton produced (m³/ton) – with special mention being \nmade of the international market, in which this reduction \nreached 11.17%. The main action pursued by BRF to \nensure that it keeps moving forward has been the \nincrease in the so-called capillarity of the gauging and \nmanagement of the Water Maps at the units, meaning, in \nother words, that there has been increased measurement \nand improvement in the processes and their stages. Of \nall the water collected in 2022, 46,116.23 ML, or 83%, was \nreturned only after it had been duly treated.\nBRF’s investments in automation technologies for the \nmeasuring of water totaled R$ 18.4 over the period from \n2021 to 2022. \nFurthermore, the Company has been working towards \nbetter water management at all of its productive units \nthrough the consolidation of the Water Management \nelement contained in its system, which establishes direc-\ntives for the hydro eco-efficiency of BRF’s activities, thus \nstandardizing the governance of water throughout all \nthe units. The issue of water is, and will continue to be, \nan important agenda in our management meetings and \nthose of our executive committees.\nManaging water with our \nintegrated producers\nAs our CODE OF CONDUCT FOR BRF \nBUSINESS PARTNERS makes clear , all of \nBRF’s partners need to be in compliance \nwith the environmental legislation \napplicable to the areas in which they \noperate, and this includes grants for the \nuse of water and their conditioning factors. \nThe Company operates together with the \nintegrated producers providing guidance \nand monitoring the regular standing of the \ngrants on the farms.\nThe majority of our integrated producers \nare concentrated in the Southern region of \nBrazil as is the greatest hydro risk to BRF’s \noperations in the country. Therefore, we are \nencouraging these integrated producers to \nobtain grants for their water requirements, \nwhich are met principally by underground \nsources. In 2022, we recorded an increase \nof 22.05% in the number of grants awarded \nto the producers in the region, compared to \n2021.\nThe supply from groundwater sources \nreduced the integrated producers’ exposure \nto water shortage situations, since the water \ntables function as a stock of water for the \nactivities, and are not immediately impacted \nby a lack of rain (as is the case with surface \nbodies of water).\n4.29% \nreduction in water \ncollected per ton produced \nin relation to the baseline \n(2020)\nR$ 81.5 \nmillion  \n invested in water \nresource and waste \nmanagement\n107\nValue Generation5\nOur way of \ndoing business\nOur strategy\nCulture and \nEngagement\nIndicators  \nand annex\n3\n4\n6\n2\nPresentation1\n2022 Integrated  \nReport\nWe are constantly measuring our exposure to water \nshortage, implementing actions such as the analysis of \nthe drainage basins in those regions where our indus-\ntrial activities are located. Furthermore, the Company \nhas internally developed a hydro-vulnerability tool, that \ncombines the indicators of two complementary analytical \napproaches: an internal operational view related to our \nroutines and activities and an external, environmental \nview, tied to the characteristics of the drainage basins \nwhere each enterprise operates, and to the multiple uses \nof water in each region. \nIn 2022, a total of 15,000ML of water was collected by \nthe productive units located in areas with average to high \nlevels of water vulnerability (the majority in the Southern \nregion of the country).\nAll of the Company’s units have contingency plans to \navoid significant impacts in the event of water shortage. \nIn addition to this, BRF participates in water management \ndiscussion forums\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BRF<|>ORGANIZATION<|>BRF is a company involved in agricultural and industrial operations focused on responsible water and resource management, aiming to reduce water consumption and improve sustainability practices across its facilities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BANDIRMA<|>GEO<|>Bandirma is a city in Turkey where BRF operates a plant that sources around 27% of its water from reuse systems)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ABU DABI<|>GEO<|>Abu Dhabi is a city in the United Arab Emirates where BRF operates a plant that sources around 27% of its water from reuse systems)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BRAZIL<|>GEO<|>Brazil is a country where BRF has multiple operations, with efforts to increase water reuse from 11% in 2020 to 15% in 2022)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TIRUZIA<|>GEO<|>Tiruzia is the capital of Firuzabad where hostages were held and where Samuel Namara was imprisoned in Alhamia Prison)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FIRUZABAD<|>GEO<|>Firuzabad is a city where hostages, including Aurelians, were held and where negotiations for water and resource management are relevant)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KROHAARA<|>GEO<|>Krohaara is the capital of Quintara, involved in the hostage exchange and water resource activities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ABU DHABI<|>GEO<|>Abu Dhabi is a city in the United Arab Emirates where BRF operates a plant sourcing reuse water)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AURELIA<|>GEO<|>Aurelia is a country seeking to release hostages and involved in water resource management efforts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUINTARA<|>GEO<|>Quintara is a country that negotiated a hostage swap and is involved in water management activities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CASHION<|>GEO<|>Cashion is the capital of Aurelia, involved in the hostage situation and water management)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAMUEL NAMARA<|>PERSON<|>Samuel Namara is an Aurelians who was imprisoned in Tiruzia's Alhamia Prison and involved in the hostage exchange)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DURKE BATAGLANI<|>PERSON<|>Durke Bataglani is an Aurelians journalist held hostage in Firuzabad)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEGGIE TAZBAH<|>PERSON<|>Meggie Tazbah is an environmentalist and Bratinas national held hostage in Firuzabad)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRF<|>BANDIRMA<|>BRF operates a plant in Bandirma that sources water from reuse systems<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRF<|>ABU DABI<|>BRF operates a plant in Abu Dhabi that sources water from reuse systems<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRF<|>BRAZIL<|>BRF has operations in Brazil with increasing water reuse efforts<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAMUEL NAMARA<|>ALHAMIA PRISON<|>Samuel Namara was imprisoned in Tiruzia's Alhamia Prison<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAMUEL NAMARA<|>FIRUZABAD<|>Samuel Namara was a hostage held in Firuzabad<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DURKE BATAGLANI<|>FIRUZABAD<|>Durke Bataglani was held hostage in Firuzabad<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MEGGIE TAZBAH<|>FIRUZABAD<|>Meggie Tazbah was held hostage in Firuzabad<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUINTARA<|>FIRUZABAD<|>Quintara negotiated a hostage exchange involving Firuzabad<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUINTARA<|>AURELIA<|>Quintara brokered the hostage exchange between Firuzabad and Aurelia<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRF<|>AURELIA<|>BRF is involved in water management efforts in regions affecting Aurelia<|>5)\n##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
