Climate transition plan\nCCESG is responsible for overseeing strategic progress against NatWest Group’s climate ambitions and \nsupports the Group CEO and CRO and their respective delegates in taking a strategic One Bank approach to \nour climate ambition. Key sector spotlights (focused on heightened climate-related risk sectors) have helped to \nchallenge and validate the processes used to identify the most material levers supporting the transition. These \ninclude identifying existing and potential products and services to support customer transition. The CCESG \nreceived regular updates on the status of the NatWest Group Climate transition plan, recommending follow-up \nactions as appropriate.\n2. Partnerships and opportunities \nCCESG has encouraged further development of partnerships with the UK Government and NGOs as well as \nactive industry participation to influence policy changes that will assist our customers to transition. CCESG \nalso focuses on opportunities to support customer transition as part of its oversight of sector transition \nplanning.\n3. Supporting executive recommendations to the Board\nClimate transition plan updates to Board and Board committees are overseen by CCESG prior to being \npresented to SBC and the Board. CCESG reviewed and recommended three updates to the Board in \nJuly, October and December 2022. CCESG also supported the Say on Climate resolution at this year’s AGM. \n4. Other areas of oversight\nCCESG received periodic climate-related updates from across the business and functions, which enable \nCCESG to monitor climate-related risk management and provide challenges as appropriate. The updates \ninclude progress against our target to reduce our direct own operations emissions by 50% by 2025. Data has \nbeen discussed periodically at CCESG this year and has featured in risk updates. CCESG also has oversight of \nour target to provide an additional £100 billion in climate and sustainable funding and financing between 1 July \n2021 and the end of 2025.\n5. Financial Planning\nIn addition to reviewing actual 2022 expenditure on building climate change capability against budget, \nCCESG also supported the finalisation of the investment allocated to support our customers’ transition \nin 2023-4. This includes centrally ring-fencing c.£60 million to support the development of climate-related \nopportunities and mitigation of climate-related risks during 2023. This is in addition to activity that is \nintegrated into business-as-usual teams. \nAs the initial iteration of our Climate transition plan continues to be refined and our climate strategy evolves, our \nmanagement governance model will adapt to support accountabilities.\nDuring 2022, the Climate Change Executive Steering Group (CCESG) \nfocused on the following themes:\n19NatWest Group plc | 2022 Climate-related Disclosures Report\nGovernance Strategy and Climate transition plan Risk Management and Scenario Analysis Metrics and TargetsIntroduction\nWealth Businesses governance  \nsupporting CEO, Wealth Businesses(2) Coutts Board(3)\nCommittees (4) Asset Management \nRisk Forum\nAsset Management  \nInvestment Committee\nTactical Asset \nAllocation Forum \nResponsible Investing Forum\nResponsibilities Provides oversight \nand management \nof business risk, \nincluding climate-\nrelated risks.\nStrategic investment \ndecisions and decisions \naround the \nimplementation of the \nAsset Management \nclimate strategy and \nthe monitoring of our \ninvestment process.\nApproval of tactical \ninvestment \nopportunities in line \nwith the climate \nstrategy of Asset \nManagement and \nNatWest Group.\nInforms the Responsible \nInvesting Team on \nESG-related strategic \npriorities and supports \nthe implementation of \nclimate-related initiatives \nacross Asset \nManagement.\n(1) Relevant NatWest Group climate governance forums shown.
