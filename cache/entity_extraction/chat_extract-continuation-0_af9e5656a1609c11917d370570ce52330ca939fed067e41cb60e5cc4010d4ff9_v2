Objectives \nshould include the following  elements:\n• Coverage: Net-zero sector-specific alliances may \nallow for staged implementation to net zero or \noptions for the extent of activities covered by \ninterim targets (e.g., focusing interim targets \non specific high-emitting sectors). Financial \ninstitutions should provide the rationale for \nthe decisions they have made in these regards. \nInstitutions should consider specifying what \nwas included in and what was excluded from \ntheir objectives to facilitate comparisons. \nGiven the rapid development of data, tools, and \nmethodologies in this space, financial institutions \nshould regularly revisit sectors, activities, or \nother elements not included in their current \ntransition plans. \n77 In the context of a net-zero transition plan, various years and intervals are specified by the net-zero alliances and industry \nauthorities, such as SBTi. Short-term are between five and ten years maximum with mention of 2025 and 2030 as “interim” targets. \nThe year 2040 is also used as an interim year. \n78 United Nations, COP26 Together for our planet .\n79 GFANZ expects that financial institutions will use various combinations of strategies and tactics to achieve a net-zero transition as \nalso acknowledged by SBTi in their description of possible mitigation strategies in their report Foundations for Science-Based Net-\nZero Target Setting in the Financial Sector .\n• Timelines: Financial institutions should  \narticulate how net-zero transition plan actions  \nwill be staged, for example over the immediate \n(1 year), short (2–3 years), and medium (by 2030) \ntimeframes. Net-zero transition plans should \nconsider defining how they expect their longer-\nterm (by 2050) strategy to evolve from current \napproaches to meet their net-zero target date. \nPlans should include both interim GHG emissions \ntargets (2030 or earlier)77 and net-zero targets \n(2050 or earlier targets). \n• Key climate topics: While the transition to \nnet zero involves the whole economy, certain \nsectors and activities are central to aligning  \nwith a low- or no-overshoot 1.5 degrees \nC-aligned pathway. Financial institutions should \nconsider articulating how they plan to address \nsuch topics throughout their transition plans,  \nin particular through policies and conditions. \nTwo such topics highlighted at COP26 were the \nneed to halt and reverse deforestation by 2030 \nand the need to transition away from unabated \nfossil fuels.78 \nFinancial institutions should state how they will \nprioritize different key financing strategies to \nsupport the real-economy transition to net zero. 79 \nPrioritization of key financing strategy(ies) may \ndepend on the financial institution’s size, business \nmodel, levers of influence, operating environment, \nportfolio and client characteristics and emissions \nprofiles, and geographic coverage, among other \nfactors. The application of the Implementation \nStrategy and Engagement Strategy themes should \nbe guided by the prioritized financing strategies. \nFOUNDATIONS\nCONTENTS  |  FINANCIAL INSTITUTION NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLANS — FUNDAMENTALS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND GUIDANCE\n31\nThe key financing strategies (introduced in   \nPart B) for financial institutions to support the real-\neconomy net-zero transition include the following:\n• Climate solutions: Financing or enabling entities \nand activities that develop and scale climate  \nsolutions. This should include financing, investing, \nand related services supporting activities \nsuch as early-stage climate technologies and \nservices to bring them into mainstream; later-\nstage climate solutions to scale and increase \ndeployment; new infrastructure needed for the \nlow-carbon economy; nature-based solutions; \nand understanding and addressing risks \nassociated with new zero-carbon activities \nand industries.\n• Aligned: Financing or enabling entities that \nare already aligned to a 1.5 degrees C pathway. \nActions to do so should include shifting portfolio \nallocations and
