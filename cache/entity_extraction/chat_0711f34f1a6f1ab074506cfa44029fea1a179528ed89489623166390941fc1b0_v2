Qualifying products are those that either:\n• increase the efficiency of a product during its use phase (for example, our battery materials \nand fuel cell components); or\n• increase the efficiency of the manufacturing process used to make a product (for example, \nour catalysts and additives for the chemical, oil and gas industries).\nProducts beyond the scope of this assessment include those specifically designed to meet \nenvironmental regulatory requirements, and any product where a use-phase resource \nefficiency benefit is unclear. Revenues aligned to the use-phase resource efficiency criteria \nrepresent sales excluding precious metals.\nOur goal: Achieve net zero by 2040\nOur operational carbon footprint is reported in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) \naccording to the GHG Protocol corporate standard 2015 revision, www.ghgprotocol.org and \nin with the UK Stream-lined Energy and Carbon Reporting (SECR) April 2019 requirements \nof the UK Companies Act 2006 (Strategic and Directors’ Reports) Regulations 2013.\nScope 1 GHG emissions\nOur Scope 1 GHG emissions are generated by the direct burning of fuel (predominantly \nnatural gas), performing chemical reactions in our manufacturing processes and driving \ncompany-owned or leased vehicles. They are calculated in tonnes CO2e using conversion \nfactors for each energy source as published by Defra in June 2022 and subsequently amended \nin September 2022 – we have used the amended version. We include carbon dioxide (CO2), \nnitrous oxide (N2O), refrigerant and methane (CH4) process emissions to air in our Scope 1 \ncalculations. We don’t believe we have any material Scope 1 GHG emissions of PF5 and SF6\nScope 2 GHG emissions\nOur Scope 2 GHG emissions arise from the use of electricity and steam procured from third \nparties for use at our facilities. They are calculated using the ‘dual reporting’ methodology \noutlined in the GHG Protocol corporate standard 2015 revision.\nFor the location-based method of Scope 2 accounting, for all facilities outside the US, we use \nnational carbon intensity factors related to the consumption of grid electricity in 2020 made \navailable in the 2022 edition of the world CO2 emissions database of the International Energy \nAgency. They were purchased under licence in February 2022 for sole use in company \nreporting. For US facilities we use regional carbon factors published by the Environmental \nProtection Agency in January 2023 edition of, eGRID data 2021. \nFor the market-based method of Scope 2 accounting, we have applied the hierarchy of \nsources for determination of appropriate carbon intensity factors, as outlined in table 6.3 \non page 48 of the GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance. We have successfully obtained carbon \nintensity factors directly from our grid electricity suppliers in the EU, US and Australia. \nHowever, it has not been possible to obtain this information from suppliers in China, India, \nSouth Africa and non-OECD Europe. \nScope 3 GHG emissions\nOur annual Scope 3 GHG emissions are reported according to the methodology of the GHG \nProtocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard. A variety \nof accounting techniques were used depending on the availability of data. All value chain \nemissions over which JM has financial control are included; therefore our scope 3 reporting \ndoes not include raw materials where JM is a toll manufacturer i.e. when raw materials being \nused in our factories remain in the financial ownership of our customer at all times.\nWhen calculating the GHG footprint of each Scope 3 category, our principle of using the most \naccurate data sources was applied in the following order:\n• GHG footprint data obtained directly from value chain partners\n• Mass based calculations using carbon intensity factors from respected databases, such \nas Defra’s GHG reporting conversion factors and EcoInvent\n• Financial allocation using Avieco’s proprietary Input-Output (EEIO) model.
