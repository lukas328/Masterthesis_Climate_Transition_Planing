Since 2021, the \nBoard has received four reports regarding Citi’s Net Zero Plan and progress towards Citi’s climate-related \ngoals. The Board also received a climate risk and net zero deep-dive tutorial from the Chief Sustainability \nOfficer (CSO), Global Head of Climate Risk and the Global Head of Corporate Banking.\nThree Board-level committees also have direct oversight responsibility for climate-related activities: the \nNomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee (NGPAC), the Risk Management Committee (RMC) \nand the Audit Committee (AC).  \nThe NGPAC oversees many of Citi’s ESG activities, including receiving reports from and advising \nmanagement on climate-related matters. The NGPAC receives reports from Citi’s Chief Sustainability \nOfficer on at least an annual basis. The NGPAC also reviews Citi’s policies, programs and disclosure \napproach for sustainability and climate change issues, and oversees management’s engagement with \ninvestors and major external stakeholders on sustainability and climate change matters. Since 2021, the \nNGPAC has received a number of meetings to review shareholder proposals (including ones related to \nfossil fuel financing and biodiversity) and received an ESG update in 2022. For more information on the \nroles and responsibilities of the NGPAC, please see our NGPAC Charter.\nThe RMC provides oversight of Citi’s risk management framework and reviews Citi’s key risk policies \nand practices, including those focused on climate-related risks. The RMC also receives updates, as \nnecessary and appropriate, from management on climate-related risk. During 2022, the RMC received \nupdates on climate risk including the climate risk management framework, client-level climate \nassessment methodology and results of climate scenario analysis. For more information on the roles and \nresponsibilities of the RMC, please see our RMC Charter.\nThe AC assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, such as general compliance with legal \nand regulatory requirements and our internal disclosure controls and procedures. Ultimately, the AC has \noversight over the controls and procedures related to Citi’s ESG and climate-related reporting, including \nboth voluntary disclosures and regulatory filings. In 2022, the AC held two meetings to review existing ESG \ndisclosure controls and procedures. For more information on the roles and responsibilities of the AC, please \nsee our AC Charter.\nDetails regarding our Board’s and Board committee’s oversight of climate matters, including the scope of \nthe NGPAC’s oversight of Citi’s climate activities and performance and the RMC’s oversight of risk policies \nand frameworks, are described in greater detail in our prior TCFD Reports and in these committees’ \ncharters on our website.\n14 | TCFD REPORT 2022: CITI’S APPROACH TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND NET ZERO\nManagement Responsibility\nThe role of assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities is a shared responsibility \nacross Citi. Senior managers from the Institutional Clients Group, Risk Management, Enterprise Services \nand Public Affairs, Finance and Legal collaborate and work simultaneously to manage climate risk and \nimplement Citi’s Net Zero Plan. \nIn 2022, Citi’s climate management governance structure continued to evolve as we enhanced our climate \nstrategy to implement our Net Zero Plan and meet our global objectives. We updated and reorganized our \nclimate management structure to respond to our growing understanding of climate-related risks and how \nto best achieve our climate goals. Accordingly, we added a new position, the Head of Net Zero Operations, \nin 2022 to provide leadership and expertise to specifically help us reach our goal of net zero emissions \nfor our operations by 2030. This role works closely with the Citi Location and Realty Services team, which \nis responsible for monitoring and reporting on operational footprint goals. Also, in 2022 we realigned \nour Climate Risk team to be housed within our Enterprise Risk Management function to further embed \nclimate within our risk management policies and practices. We continued to grow our Climate Risk team \nto increase the capabilities and climate-related expertise of this important management body.
