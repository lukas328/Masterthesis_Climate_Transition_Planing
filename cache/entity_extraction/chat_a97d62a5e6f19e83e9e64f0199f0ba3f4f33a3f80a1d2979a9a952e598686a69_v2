The Group has included an allowance of £100m for this contingent liability for retrospective \npayments within the Solvency II regulatory balance sheet. The final impact is likely to differ materially from this \nvalue and this is a calculation for Solvency II purposes and not a pre-estimate of all actual or potential losses \nrelating to Isapre Cruz Blanca. \nBupa Annual Report 2022 196 \n    \n     \n \n     \n       \n      \n       \n       \n      \n     \n \n     \n         \n        \n      \n       \n     \n     \n       \n     \n \n                \n     \n    \n          \n                  \n   \n          \n    \n   \nStrategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements \nFinancial Statements of the Company \nStatement of Financial Position \nas at 31 December 2022 \n2022 2021 \nNote £m £m \nAssets \nIntangible assets A 63 \n24 \n200 \n404 \n159 \n21 \n871 \n84 \n23 \n200 \n541 \n130 \n23 \n1,001 \nProperty, plant and equipment \nInvestment in subsidiaries \nPost-employment benefit net assets \nTrade and other receivables \nCurrent taxation asset \nTotal assets \nB \nC \nD \nE \nLiabilities \nLease liabilities \nPost-employment benefit net liabilities \nProvisions for liabilities and charges \nDeferred taxation liabilities \nTrade and other payables \nTotal liabilities \nF \nD \nG \nH \nI \n(6) \n(44) \n(14) \n(76) \n(208) \n(348) \n(6) \n(60) \n(9) \n(143) \n(170) \n(388) \nNet assets 523 613 \nEquity \nIncome and expenditure reserve 523 613 \nTotal equity 523 613 \nApproved by the Board of Directors and signed on its behalf on 1 March 2023 by \nRoger Davis James Lenton \nChairman Group CFO \nNotes A-L form the associated notes to the Company financial statements. \nThe Company accounting policies are aligned with those of the Group, described in notes 1-28, except as described \nin notes A-L below. \nBupa Annual Report 2022 197 \n   \n  \n       \n                 \n                 \n                \n               \n       \n          \n     \n   \nStrategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements \nFinancial Statements of the Company continued \nIncome Statement and Statement \nof Comprehensive Income \nFor the year ended 31 December 2022 \nThe loss for the year recorded within the financial statements of the Company, The British United Provident \nAssociation Limited (Bupa), is £6m (2021: £30m).
