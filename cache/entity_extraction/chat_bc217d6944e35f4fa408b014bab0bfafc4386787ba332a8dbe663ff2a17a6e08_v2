To attract the most \ndiverse candidates and talent, we made changes to \nflexible working to support working parents and carers. \nWe celebrate inclusion and diversity across the whole \norganisation and are truly committed to ensure that \nBupa reflects our customers, wider society and the \ncommunities in which we operate. \nOn both the CEC (Chief Executive Committee) and \nthe Board, the gender balance this year has positively \nshifted, from 26% to 36% between 2022 and 2023. \nAlthough we have made positive change, our long-term \nambition and plan remains to ensure balanced gender \nrepresentation in our executive committee on an \nongoing basis. \nWomen account for over two thirds of our workforce \nand, whilst we strive for further representation at our \nhighest leadership levels, we are encouraged by the \npipeline of female talent to support this change going \nforward. We recognise this is not a short-term fix but \na process of long-term commitment. \nThe outcomes of our efforts remain to foster a culture \nthat allows everyone to be their best.
