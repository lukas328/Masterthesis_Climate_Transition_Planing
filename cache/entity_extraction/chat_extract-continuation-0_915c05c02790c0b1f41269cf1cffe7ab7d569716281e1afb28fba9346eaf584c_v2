The carrying value of goodwill may be adjusted up to 12 months from the accounting date of \nacquisition, as the allocation of the purchase price to identifiable intangible assets is finalised within that period. \nGoodwill arising on business combinations is capitalised and presented with goodwill and intangible assets in \nthe Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. Where the fair value of net assets acquired is greater than \nthe consideration paid, the excess is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement. \nGoodwill is held at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Impairment reviews are performed annually or more \nfrequently if there is an indication that the carrying value may be impaired. Impairment reviews are performed \nat the level of the relevant cash-generating unit (CGU). In identifying CGUs, the Group considers the smallest \nidentifiable group of assets that generate independent cash inflows, how managers monitor operations and \nthe level at which strategic decisions are made. \nOther intangible assets \nIntangible assets, other than goodwill, that are acquired as part of a business combination are recognised at fair \nvalue which represents cost at acquisition and are subsequently held at cost less accumulated amortisation and \nimpairment. Intangible assets acquired separately are held at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment. \nCosts relating to the development of intangible assets, including computer software, are capitalised once all \ndevelopment phase recognition criteria are met. \nAmortisation is charged to the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis as follows, excluding any \nintangible assets to which an indefinite useful life has been\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>UK<|>GEO<|>United Kingdom, a country in Europe, with taxation policies affecting income and corporate taxes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUPA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Bupa is a global healthcare group providing health insurance, care services, and related activities, as detailed in their 2022 financial report)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPANISH SUPREME COURT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The highest judicial authority in Spain, which made a decision impacting Bupa's provisions for 2021)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FOREIGN<|>GEO<|>Refers to international jurisdictions where Bupa operates and faces different taxation rules)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASSOCIATES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Business entities related to Bupa, involved in financial results and taxation considerations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROPERTY<|>GEO<|>Real estate assets, including revaluations and temporary differences affecting taxation and accounting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INCOME<|>EVENT<|>Financial income generated by Bupa, subject to taxation and adjustments in the report)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DISPOSAL<|>EVENT<|>Sale or disposal of business assets, impacting impairment and taxation calculations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ACQUISITION<|>EVENT<|>Business acquisition activities, affecting goodwill and intangible assets)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOODWILL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Intangible asset representing excess purchase price over fair value of net identifiable assets, subject to impairment testing)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTANGIBLE ASSETS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Non-physical assets such as software and development costs, recognized at fair value and amortized)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TAXATION<|>EVENT<|>The process of levying taxes on income and assets, including current and deferred taxes, as detailed in the report)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEFERRED TAXATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tax effects of temporary differences and carryforwards, impacting future tax expenses)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES<|>EVENT<|>Differences between accounting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, leading to deferred tax assets or liabilities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REVALUATION<|>EVENT<|>Adjustments to property values affecting accounting and taxation, including unrealized losses)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROVISION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Legal or financial reserve set aside, such as the £43m release following the Spanish Supreme Court decision)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOSS<|>EVENT<|>Financial loss before taxation, affecting effective tax rate calculations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROFIT<|>EVENT<|>Financial profit before taxation, used to determine tax expenses and effective rates)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TAX RATE<|>EVENT<|>The statutory percentage applied to taxable income, used in calculations of tax at the UK and foreign jurisdictions)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BUPA<|>UK<|>Bupa operates in the UK, subject to UK taxation policies<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BUPA<|>SPANISH SUPREME COURT<|>The court's decision impacted Bupa's tax provisions for 2021<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BUPA<|>FOREIGN<|>Bupa's international operations involve foreign taxation on income<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BUPA<|>ASSOCIATES<|>Bupa's associates contribute to its financial results and are affected by taxation<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROPERTY<|>TAXATION<|>Property revaluations influence deferred taxes and accounting figures<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INCOME<|>TAXATION<|>Income generated by Bupa is subject to taxation policies<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DISPOSAL<|>TAXATION<|>Disposal of assets impacts impairment and tax calculations<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ACQUISITION<|>GOODWILL<|>Acquisitions lead to recognition of goodwill and intangible assets<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GOODWILL<|>TAXATION<|>Goodwill is tested for impairment and affects tax calculations<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INTANGIBLE ASSETS<|>TAXATION<|>Intangible assets are amortized and impact deferred taxes<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES<|>DEFERRED TAXATION<|>Temporary differences cause deferred tax assets or liabilities<|>8)\n##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
