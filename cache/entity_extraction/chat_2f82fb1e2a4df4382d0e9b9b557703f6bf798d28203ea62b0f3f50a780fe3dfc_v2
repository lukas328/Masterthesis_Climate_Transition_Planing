In case of a discrepancy, the Spanish original will prevail.\nSECTION 02 / STRATEGY\nMain advances in \nthe execution of the \nstrategy\nThe global Sustainability business area \nhas continued to actively promote the \nsustainability strategy in the 3 goals and \nindicators mentioned above:\n1. Foster new business \nthrough sustainability\nThe role of the financial sector in general, \nand of BBVA in particular, is essential, \naccompanying customers in their transition \ntowards a sustainable future, developing \nspecific products for customers and \nfinancing this profitable investment.\nSustainability is a lever for growth for BBVA \nand it has a holistic approach, with a focus \non climate action and inclusive growth, \ncovering all segments. T o capture this \nopportunity, we are working on five lines \nof growth:\n Sector strategy for corporate clients: \nfocused on low-carbon technologies \nand high-emission sectors to help them \ndecarbonise. Sector plans are being \ndrawn up to proactively address the \nreduction of the carbon footprint of the \nloans that BBVA grants to its clients \n(alignment of portfolios) and the teams \nspecialized in sustainability are being \nstrengthened.\n Promoting the company: developing \nproducts focused on six themes (auto, \nreal estate, agriculture, supply chain, \nenergy and inclusive growth), taking \nadvantage of the Bank’s knowledge \nwith corporate customers and creating \ndedicated teams in all geographies.\n Launch of bets to rapidly expand the \nretail business by using the Bank’s digital \nadvantage: this line is making it possible \nto create an innovative and disruptive \nvalue proposition in specific sectors, \nfor which teams have been created \ndedicated to developing new solutions \nin cars, energy efficiency and carbon \nmarkets.\n Financing of new sustainable \ntechnologies, which are currently \nunbankable with traditional financing \nstructures (hydrogen, batteries, carbon \ncapture, storage and use technologies, \netc.), allowing BBVA to be a reference in \nthe ecosystem.\n Building sustainability risk management \ncapacity: Achieving superior risk \nmanagement capacity is a key element \nin fostering growth. The focus is on \nembedding sustainability throughout the \nrisk value chain, from the risk appetite \nframework to the loan approval process. \nThe development of specific tools is \na priority as a key element in decision \nmaking. Sectoral plans have also been \ndeveloped for the 6 sectors in which \nalignment objectives have been set \n(oil & gas, power generation, autos, steel \nand cement) or phase-out goals, as is the \ncase of the sector of coal.\nGoal 2025\nBetween 2018 and 2022, BBVA channelled \na total of €135.871bn into sustainable \nactivities. This represents 45% of the \nchannelling target: €300bn by 2025.\nP.  33\nBBVA Report on TCFD 2022\nThis English version is a translation of the original in Spanish for information purposes only. In case of a discrepancy, the Spanish original will prevail.\nSECTION 02 / STRATEGY\nIntegration of sustainability in \nfinancial planning\nBBVA incorporates sustainability in its \nday-to-day business, both in customer \nrelations and internal processes, including \nits management control and reporting \nprocesses. \nBBVA in Spain is already integrating \nsustainability into its financial reporting to \nsenior management and business areas. \nThese reports on sustainable transactions \ninclude financial plans and budgets. Several \ninternal resource allocation decisions are \nderived from them.\nOn a recurring basis, financial reports \nare used for decision-making based on \nthe sustainability vector, including data \non sustainable business channelling, \nprofitability, sustainable activity penetration \npercentage, as well as balance sheets and \nincome statements that allow to monitor \nsustainable transactions for each business \nsegments.\nSustainability is expected to be gradually \nintegrated into other business areas as well.\nSingle Development Agenda \nThe “Single Development Agenda” (SDA) is \nthe process by which scarce resources, both \nfinancial and human, are allocated to those \nprojects that are best aligned with BBVA’s \nstrategy and that will have the greatest \nimpact. The exercise is implemented \ndynamically in quarterly cycles.\nThe scope of the SDA covers all manner of \nprojects or initiatives of all the companies \nwithin the consolidated scope of the BBVA \nGroup and its business areas in all countries. \nThese are actions that require resources \nduring a limited period of time to produce \npreviously defined deliverables that seek to \nachieve an impact or objective.\nStrategic analyses of the project portfolio, \nboth globally and locally, are conducted \non an ongoing basis during the quarter. \nThese analyses are carried out to provide \nan overall view of the project inventory and \nits performance, as well as to provide an in-\ndepth analysis of specific issues as required.\nIn addition, as a result of the strategic plan \napproved by the Bank’s Board of Directors \nin\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
