Encouraging and assisting portfolio companies \nto adopt a low carbon pathway and operating model via our \ninfluence as an asset owner is mutually beneficial.  \nWe are aligned with the NZAOA view that doing so is the best climate \nrisk mitigation strategy that investors – individually or collectively \n– can put in place. \nPrudential is uniquely positioned as both a global and a local asset \nowner, which affects our approach towards decarbonisation and \nengagement, as well as how we work with our asset managers. \nOur position as a local asset owner within many emerging markets \nin Asia and Africa means we invest the majority of our assets within \nthe countries where we operate. We believe that this development \nof capital markets is a positive societal contribution. As we seek to \nhedge local insurance liabilities with local assets, we are likely to be \na significant buyer of local market securities, often government or \nstate-controlled entities. By assisting governments to develop \nsustainable and efficient securities markets, we can help to reduce \nthe cost of investment funding across society. This should create \nmore opportunities for economic growth, levels of employment \nand employment incomes. Over time, we see similar opportunities \nto apply these same basic principles around green finance, and \npotentially ‘crowd in’ further investment flows, helping to create \na virtuous circle to support a just and inclusive transition.  \nWhile our role as local asset owner has these benefits from a capital \nmarket growth perspective, it also means we must take very specific \nlocal circumstances into account as we support the transition from \ntoday’s starting point. From a financial perspective, local markets \nremain smaller and less diversified than the global financial market, \nwhich means we have fewer opportunities to change our portfolio. \nFrom a climate change perspective, it is important to realise that \ncompanies operating within emerging markets are often more \ncarbon intensive, and have a different starting point for \ndecarbonisation. This means we must accept a higher initial \nbaseline for decarbonisation, and explore and implement a wider \nvariety of strategies to achieve the ultimate goal of net zero.\nWe employ six different implementation strategies  \n(see figure 5) to support our ESG and decarbonisation targets for  \nour investment portfolio, which are described comprehensively in  \nour 2022 ESG Report. The section below sets out more detail on our \npolicy implementation and engagement strategy, which we believe \nwill be critical to achieving our decarbonisation targets.  \nScreening the \nportfolio \nMaintaining an \nawareness of the \npotential risks to the \nGroup’s reputation \narising from \ninvestment activities \nExclusion \nExcluding a \ncompany from  \nthe investment  \nportfolio if its \nproducts or conduct \nis considered to be \nunacceptable \nESG integration \nIncorporation of \nESG information \ninto our parts of the \ninvestment process: \n> Asset allocation\n> Manager selection\n> Portfolio \nmanagement\n> Risk management\nActive \nownership \nMaintaining a \ndialogue with the \ncompanies in which \nwe invest about \nESG risks and \nopportunities \nVoting policy that \nsupports long -term \nperformance by \ntaking account of \nrelevant ESG issues \nCapital \nallocation \nShifting capital \nfrom harmful \nactivities towards \nenvironmental or \nsocial needs \n> Portfolio \ndecarbonisation\n> ESG  investments\nMarket influence \nInfluencing the \nmarket with regard \nto responsible \ninvestment by \ncontributing to \nsustainable \ninitiatives \nFigure 5: Our six implementation strategies\n12\nPrudential plc Climate Transition Plan prudentialplc.com\nCorporate engagement\nWe believe that the biggest area of influence we can have is \nvia effective engagement with our portfolio companies, to \nencourage broad scale decarbonisation strategy development \nand implementation. We strongly believe in engagement versus \ndivestment, where this is feasible. Our concern is that divestment \nwill only further increase the already large financing gap that exists \nwithin emerging markets. In line with our support for the just and \ninclusive transition, we aim to influence decarbonisation without \ncompromising social and economic development, on which \ndivestment can have such unintended consequences.  \nEastspring has developed a process to meet our target of engaging \nwith the companies responsible for 65 per cent of the absolute \ncarbon footprint of our investment portfolio. These engagement \nrequests are aligned with the recommendations of the NZAOA, \nincluding requests: \n> To immediately put into place policies and transition plans that \ncommit the company to net-zero GHG emissions across their value \nchains by no later than 2050 and to be supportive of the transition \nto a net-zero GHG emissions world by 2050;\n> To accelerate progress towards full ‘green’ on the CA100+ Net Zero \nCompany Benchmark indicators, or, if not a CA100+ target \ncompany, to still meet all its expectations;\n> To set science-based near-term GHG reduction targets that are in \nline with reaching net-zero emissions by 2050, and consistent with\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PRUDENTIAL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Prudential plc is a global financial institution actively involved in responsible investment, decarbonisation, and engagement strategies to promote a net-zero economy, primarily operating in emerging markets in Asia and Africa)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EASTSPRING<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Eastspring is a division or subsidiary of Prudential involved in developing processes for engaging with companies responsible for significant carbon footprints, aiming to meet decarbonisation targets)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NZAOA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Net Zero Asset Owner Alliance (NZAOA) is a collaborative group of asset owners committed to transitioning their investment portfolios toward net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CA100+<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Climate Action 100+ (CA100+) is an investor-led initiative that encourages companies to improve climate-related disclosures, set science-based targets, and accelerate decarbonisation efforts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRUDENTIAL<|>PERSON<|>Prudential's leadership emphasizes responsible investment, decarbonisation, and active engagement with portfolio companies to promote sustainability and climate risk mitigation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EASTSPRING<|>PERSON<|>Eastspring is responsible for developing engagement processes with companies to meet decarbonisation and net-zero targets, aligning with NZAOA and CA100+ recommendations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRUDENTIAL<|>GEO<|>Prudential operates primarily in emerging markets across Asia and Africa, investing in local securities and supporting local capital markets development)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EASTSPRING<|>GEO<|>Eastspring operates within the regions where Prudential invests, focusing on engaging local companies and markets to support decarbonisation and sustainable development)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>2022 ESG Report<|>EVENT<|>Prudential's 2022 ESG Report details the company's strategies, progress, and policies related to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues, including decarbonisation efforts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Climate Transition Plan<|>EVENT<|>Prudential's Climate Transition Plan outlines the company's approach to achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions through engagement, decarbonisation strategies, and market influence)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PRUDENTIAL<|>EASTSPRING<|>Eastspring is a division or subsidiary of Prudential responsible for implementing engagement and decarbonisation strategies<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PRUDENTIAL<|>NZAOA<|>Prudential aligns with the NZAOA's view that portfolio decarbonisation is a key climate risk mitigation strategy<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PRUDENTIAL<|>CA100+<|>Prudential supports CA100+ initiatives to encourage companies to set science-based GHG reduction targets<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PRUDENTIAL<|>2022 ESG Report<|>The ESG Report documents Prudential's progress and policies on responsible investment and decarbonisation<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PRUDENTIAL<|>Climate Transition Plan<|>The Climate Transition Plan guides Prudential's efforts to achieve net-zero emissions<|>7)\n##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
