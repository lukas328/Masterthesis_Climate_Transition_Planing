We \nwant all of our people to feel healthier because they \nwork at Bupa, and so we have just launched a new \ninitiative, Viva, to fulfil our commitment. This approach \nwas endorsed in 2022 and all our people will have \naccess to health benefit support and Bupa products \nand services by the end of 2023. \nImportantly, we involved frontline colleagues in \ndeveloping this offering, and with their input tested and \nrefined the proposition, to ensure what we're offering \nwill make a difference and be valued by our people. \nWe believe this is ground-breaking for some of the \nindustries in which we work, and role-models living \nour purpose for our people. \nListening and engaging with our people \nIn November 2022, we ran our global People Pulse \nsurvey, for all employees to have their say about what \nit is like working at Bupa. 57,519 people responded \n(79%), providing 59,254 comments. For the first time, \nwe received a global result of 80, achieving our high-\nperforming (top decile) external benchmark, which \nwe have been aiming for since we began our current \napproach to employee listening in 2018. We saw \nimprovements across all 14 survey questions, with six \nquestions now on or above external benchmark. We \nalso saw a positive shift in the comment sentiment, \nwhich is very encouraging. Through their global data, \nour engagement partners, Glint reported continued \nvolatility and a downward trend in engagement levels, \ntherefore, Bupa’s results indicate that we are \nperforming well compared to the external environment. \nWhile celebrating this success, we are keen to maintain \nmomentum with engagement, and are committed to \ncontinually improving our people’s experience of \nworking here. \nBupa Annual Report 2022 20 \n         \n       \n       \n       \n          \n       \n      \n      \n         \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \n       \n         \n         \n           \n        \n         \n       \n       \n        \n        \n \n  \n  \n         \n        \n         \n        \n    \n         \n         \n        \n        \n        \n         \n     \n          \n        \n       \n      \n          \n       \n          \n   \n       \n        \n         \n         \n  \n        \n      \n       \n       \n         \n       \n   \n \n        \n        \n  \n         \n          \n       \n          \n         \n        \n          \n  \n        \n        \n       \n    \n     \n   \n       \n       \n    \n          \n   \n   \nStrategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements \nPeople and culture continued \nOur people are also highly engaged through one single \nglobal internal communications platform.

This has quickly become the go-to platform \nfor sharing customer stories, recognising our people, \ncascading and connecting on relevant information \nand building connections across the globe. \nIn 2022, we delivered our first major global engagement \ncampaign through the platform, called the Bupa World \nTour. Our people shared their diverse cultures, lifestyles, \nlanguages and even their favourite foods through a \nvariety of activities. The campaign ran for six weeks and \nsaw more than half a million page impressions. We also \nrelaunched the Bupa Awards, asking our people to \nnominate their colleagues for outstanding work in three \ncategories: brave, caring and responsible. We received \nover 6,000 nominations, which were then voted for by \nour people, resulting in ten winners around the world. \nIñaki Ereño, Group CEO, interviewed at the 2022 Bupa Awards in London.’ \nWe also introduced additional ways for our Board \nmembers to connect directly with our people to hear \ntheir feedback.
