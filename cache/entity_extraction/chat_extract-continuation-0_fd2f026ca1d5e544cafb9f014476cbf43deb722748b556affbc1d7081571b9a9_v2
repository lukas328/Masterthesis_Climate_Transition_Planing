Ultimately, the Group’s commitment is to reach to net \nzero emissions by 2050. \nThe portfolio’s intensity (195g CO2/km) has shortened the gap with the \nindustry pathway (180g CO2/km), especially during the last year (-7g CO2/\nkm), even when the size of the portfolio has remained stable compared to \n2020. This is due to the focus placed in supporting customers investing in \nnew technologies and on reducing new financing to misaligned customers.\nThe sector continues to transition to decarbonization by investing in the \nEVs (electric vehicles) and hybridization. As a matter of fact, in Europe \n(BBVA’s core geographical area in this industry) the car production has \nremained flattish, with EV and hybrids increasing their market shares, at \nthe expense of ICE (internal combustion engine) sales. BBVA’s strategy \nwill be actively driven by accompanying and financing customers with an \nadvanced level on transition14 which currently represent the totality of the \ntotal commitment.\nIt is important to note that progress towards these targets is expected to \nbe non-linear in the short term. \n14. Customers are considered to be advanced in their transition when they show a solid position according to internal \ntools such as the T ransition Risk indicator (TRi), including the definition of medium-term emission reduction targets, the \nidentification of reduction levers for the emissions management and the commitment of capital investments to execute its \ntransition plan and/or other internal evaluations based on the intensity of the customer’s emissions compared to its peers.\nP.  77\nBBVA Report on TCFD 2022\nThis English version is a translation of the original in Spanish for information purposes only.

This has been possible thanks to the increasing accompaniment \nwith customers outperforming the market in terms of their carbon \nintensity and, in the specific case of T urkey, it has been positively influenced \nby an improvement in the emission factors provided by the data provider \nfor 2022.\nDecarbonizing the steel industry will require heavy investments in new \nproduction modes EAF (Electric Arc Furnaces) and H2-DRI (Direct \nReduction of Iron with Hydrogen), and an increased proportion of recycled \nmaterials. BBVA’s strategy will be actively driven by accompanying and \nfinancing customers with an advanced level on transition15, which currently \nrepresent 68% of the total commitment in this industry, although it is not \nyet reflected in intensities per production unit. \nIt is important to note that progress towards these targets is expected to \nbe non-linear in the short term. \n15.
