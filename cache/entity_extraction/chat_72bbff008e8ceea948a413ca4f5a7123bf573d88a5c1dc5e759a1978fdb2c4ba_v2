As a result, estimates for reduction are based on absolute emissions, \naligned with the IEA NZE scenario.\n(11) tCO2e/tonne is tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per tonne of waste generated.\n(12) Sectoral Decarbonisation Approach (SDA), Absolute Contraction Approach (ACA), Temperature Rating (TR).\nEstimates of financed emissions continued\n89NatWest Group plc | 2022 Climate-related Disclosures Report\nGovernance Strategy and Climate transition plan Risk Management and Scenario Analysis Metrics and TargetsIntroduction\nBanks play a key role as facilitators between issuers and investors, by offering and conducting \nfinancial intermediation activities critical to the functioning of capital markets. Estimates of \nfacilitated emissions included in this section relate to NWM Group, including NWM N.V.\nMethodology:\nAlthough PCAF’s own methodology for financed emissions accounting continues to develop to provide an \nindustry-wide approach, there is an increasing demand for additional disclosure by facilitators, such as NatWest \nGroup, to address intermediation activities, the associated facilitated emissions and their impacts.\nFacilitation activities differ from on-balance sheet lending in two respects: they are off-balance sheet (representing \nservices rather than financing) and they can take the form of a flow activity (temporary association with \ntransactions) rather than a stock activity (recorded on the balance sheet). The PCAF working group, gathered to \nsupport the development of a standard to estimate facilitated emissions, agreed that facilitated emissions need to \nbe reported separately from financed emissions and are not additive with financed emissions.\nTo support the development of a standard to measure and report facilitated emissions related to underwriting of \ncorporate bonds capital markets transactions across the industry, NWM Group joined the PCAF Working Group on \nCapital Markets Activities in January 2022.\nThe PCAF working group published a proposed methodology for facilitated emissions for capital market instruments \nin September 2022 prior to its consultation period.\nEstimates of facilitated emissions from \ncorporate bond underwriting\n5.6\nNatWest Group’s methodology used for reporting\n1. The PCAF consultation paper recommends splitting the responsibility among the transaction lead managers (passive \nand active) based on volumes, which we source from Dealogic. This determines the proportion of the ‘facilitated’ part \nof the transaction each arranger takes responsibility for, thus providing the volume against which facilitated emissions \nis estimated(2,3). Co-managers are not counted and therefore such volumes are not taken into consideration\n2. The PCAF consultation paper defines an issuer as solely corporates that issue a debt or equity capital markets \ninstrument. Financial institutions and sovereigns, supranationals and agencies issuers were out of scope for the initial \nterms of reference for the PCAF working group and the proposed methodology included in the consultation paper.\n3. NatWest Group has decided to apply a 100% weighting for the emissions estimation for the corporate bond \ncapital markets transactions versus the Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIB) alternative at 17%.\n4. Identifying emissions to customers: where available, economic emissions intensities included in section 5.5 are \nused for customers for which volumes have been sourced following steps 1 and 2 above. Economic emissions \nintensities are applied to volumes, to estimate facilitated emissions.\n5. Unmatched customers: for those customers that cannot be matched, the relevant sector averages are used(4,5).\n6. Currently, green bonds do not have an explicit emissions footprint and therefore NatWest Group shows the \nbreakdown of conventional versus green bonds to reflect the expected difference of estimated facilitated \nemissions associated with the bond underwriting.\nFootnotes:\n(1) NatWest Group 2021 CSFFI criteria published in October 2021 have been used to determine the assets, activities and companies \nthat are eligible to be counted.\n(2) NWM Group has chosen to recognise the entire volume amount in the year of underwriting as opposed to over the life of the \nsecurity.\n(3) Percentage underwriting refers to NWM Group’s allocation, which is calculated using Dealogic tranche value face (GBP)/no. of \ntranche lead managers.\n(4) NWM Group sources customer-level emission data if possible. Where customer-level data is not available, sector averages are \nused for emission intensities from 2021 or 2020 against 2022 underwriting volumes.\n(5) The use of 2020 emission intensities may not incorporate recent changes in business activities and could result in the reporting of \na higher rate of facilitated emissions for the sector.\nThe chart below shows NWM Group’s percentage of underwriting by corporate sector taking \ninto consideration climate and sustainable funding and financing issuance with estimated facilitated \nemissions percentages in 2022. Estimated facilitated emissions percentage reflects the percentage \nfor a sector based on total estimated facilitated emissions for NWM Group. \nPower ut/uni0069l/uni0069t/uni0069es\n% of total underwr/uni0069t/uni0069ng\nCommerc/uni0069al real estate\nFood and consumer\nTelecommun/uni0069cat/uni0069ons\nReta/uni0069l\nChem/uni0069cals\nWater and waste\nAutomot/uni0069ve\nIndustr/uni0069als\nOther\nConstruct/uni0069on\nSh/uni0069pp/uni0069ng\nBu/uni0069ld/uni0069ng mater/uni0069als\n40%\n35%\n30%\n25%\n20%\n15%\n10%\n5%\n0\n50 1 1 6 0.3 2 6 15 1 1 2 14 1\ncl/uni0069mate\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
