Managed phaseout: Financing or enabling the \naccelerated managed phaseout (e.g., via early \nretirement) of high-emitting physical assets. 46 \nThis strategy facilitates significant emissions \nreduction by the identification and planned early \nretirement of assets while managing critical issues \nof service continuity and community interests. \nGFANZ believes this activity is essential to reducing \nglobal emissions and supporting a smooth and \njust economic transition. An example may be an \nidentified fossil fuel power plant with a plan in \nplace for early decommissioning on a timeframe \nconsistent with the broader net-zero trajectory.\nManaged phaseout projects:  Targeted efforts \nto reduce GHG emissions through accelerated \nretirement of high-emitting physical assets \n(shortening their operating life). Financial \ninstitutions can finance or enable strategies \nfor managed phaseout of these assets within a \ndefined science-aligned time horizon, thereby \nlimiting the likelihood that these assets will \nbe stranded in a low-carbon future. 47 These \nprojects require appropriate scrutiny and \ngovernance to ensure that emissions reduction \noccurs as planned. Further information can \nbe found in the Managed Phaseout of High-\nemitting Assets report, which outlines the \nchallenges and opportunities for financial \ninstitutions in these transactions, as well as \ndetails on how financial institutions can develop \nstrategies for managed phaseout projects.  \nCONTENTS  |  FINANCIAL INSTITUTION NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLANS — FUNDAMENTALS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND GUIDANCE\n10\nTransition finance: Investment, financing, \ninsurance, and related products and services \nthat are necessary to support an orderly, real-\neconomy transition to net zero as described by \nthe four key financing strategies that finance \nor enable 1) entities and activities that develop \nand scale climate solutions; 2) entities that are \nalready aligned to a 1.5 degrees C pathway; \n3) entities committed to transitioning in line \nwith 1.5 degrees C-aligned pathways; or 4) the \naccelerated managed phaseout of high-emitting \nphysical assets.\nScenario: Projections of what can happen  \nby creating plausible, coherent, and internally \nconsistent descriptions of possible climate \nchange futures. Scenarios are not predictions  \nof the future.48\nPathway: A goal-oriented scenario or \ncombination of scenarios answering the \nquestion “What needs to happen?” to \naccomplish a specific objective (e.g., what are \nthe steps needed to reach net zero by 2050, \nlimit global warming to 1.5 degrees C, with low \nor no overshoot?).49\nWhile the financing strategies are not intended  \nto serve as a formal taxonomy, they can provide  \na lens for understanding whether and how \nparticular assets, activities, or clients may be \naligned to the transition. In the early stages of \nthe transition, opportunities to finance or enable \ncompanies, projects, real assets, and sovereigns \nunder these financing strategies may be limited. \nAs the global community progresses toward \nnet zero, GFANZ expects the availability of such \nopportunities to increase and the allocation of \nportfolios to these four key financing strategies  \nto grow correspondingly.\nThese financing strategies should inform business \nstrategy and support decision-making across the \norganization, along with other key financial, risk, \n48 Definition taken from GFANZ. Guidance on Use of Sectoral Pathways for Financial Institutions , 2022.\n49 Definition taken from GFANZ. Guidance on Use of Sectoral Pathways for Financial Institutions , 2022.\nand noneconomic considerations. They provide an \napproach to net-zero financing that recognizes that \nclimate-related risks — transition and physical — \nshould be integrated into financial decision-making.\nThe above financing strategies may not be mutually \nexclusive, and some transactions or activities \nmight support multiple strategies. For example, \nfirms developing climate solutions may be already \naligned to net zero or in the process of aligning. \nFinancial activity across all four key financing \nstrategies may also intersect with areas of just \ntransition and biodiversity and nature. These are \nareas of active work by various initiatives as laid out \nin the Financial Institution Net-zero Transition Plans \n— Supplemental Information report. Considerations \nfor financial institutions in these areas could range \nfrom avoiding unintended negative effects on social \ngroups or nature to seeking societal and nature co-\nbenefits alongside transition activities while pan-\nsector standards are built.\nA high level of rigor and accountability in the \napplication of the four key financing strategies \nis critical to ensure that financial institutions are \nsupporting a whole-economy transition while \nachieving emissions reduction in the needed \ntimeframes. The transition plan framework in this \nreport — consisting of five themes comprising ten \ncomponents, detailed in Part C — provide resources \nand considerations for financial institutions on \nfinancing, investment, and financial services; \nmeasuring progress; and structuring governance \nof ambitious and credible transition plans. The \nframework structure of the five themes supports \nthe provision of finance and related services to \nreal-economy activities that advance the net-\nzero transition. These activities may not result in \nimmediate reductions in financed (or equivalent) \nGHG emissions for a financial institution but are \nnecessary actions to support an orderly whole-\neconomy transition to net zero by 2050.\nCONTENTS  |  FINANCIAL INSTITUTION NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLANS — FUNDAMENTALS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND GUIDANCE\n11\nFigure 2.
