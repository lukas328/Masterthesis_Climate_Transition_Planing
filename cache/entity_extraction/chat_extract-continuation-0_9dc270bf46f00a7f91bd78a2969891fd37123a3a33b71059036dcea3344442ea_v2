2-2, 2-3, 2-4, 2-5, 2-14\nThis document presents the next steps on our journey \nin communicating our results, focusing on informing our \nstakeholders of our projects, investments, strategies and key \nperformance indicators in both the financial and non-finan-\ncial areas.\nThis report covers the period from January 1st to December \n31st, 2022, including all of our operations in Brazil and in in-\nternational markets (factories, farms, distribution centers, in-\nnovation, and commercial and corporate offices) - the same \nentities outlined in the Financial Statements. The sustain-\nability indicators encompass a wide range of topics across \nour supply chain, including food quality and safety, animal \nwelfare development of our human capital, actions taken to \ntackle climate change and responsibility in the value chain. \nWhen applicable, the sections that present different data \nfor companies are highlighted in the text and the different \napproaches are described in the footnotes of the standards.\nAs in previous years, as references for this report we have \nadopted the most recent version (2021) of the Global Re-\nporting Initiative (GRI) Standards; the Integrated Reporting \nguidelines of the IFRS Foundation; and the reporting stan-\ndards established by the Sustainability Accounting Standards \nBoard (SASB). We also reference our commitments and \nactions connected to the United Nations’ Sustainable Devel-\nopment Goals (SDGs) and the Global Pact, to which we have \nbeen signatories since 2007.\nThe economic-financial data is tied to our financial state-\nments, available here, and adhere to both Brazilian stan-\ndards and the International Financial Reporting Standards \n(IFRS), in accordance with the standards of the Brazilian \nSecurities Commission (CVM) and the US Security Exchange \nCommission (SEC). There have been no cases of restatement \nof information. The veracity of the data has been ensured \nby an independent external audit, performed by KPMG, and \napproved by the Executive Board and the Administrative \nCouncil.\nOther market references that we take into consideration are \nthe requirements made by indexes including the Corporate \nSustainability Index (ISE) established by the Brazilian stock \nexchange (B3) and the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, as \nwell as the criteria of the Brazilian Association of Publicly Held \nCompanies (Abrasca). Our senior management assumes full \nresponsibility for , and approves, this report, just as it strives \nfor the correct application of the integrated thought-process \nunderlying the conception and structuring of the document. \nThe structure of the report aims to present our strategic \nvision and the key-topics in the perception of our stakehold-\ners - including suppliers, employees, management, clients, \nconsumers, communities and regulatory agencies - as identi-\nfied through a new materiality process. It also expresses the \ncommitments and pillars of the BRF Sustainability Plan with \nits concrete results outlined in the relevant chapter .\nWe aim to construct relations guided by our commitment to \nIntegrity, Quality and Safety, with this report being published \nas an important instrument in terms of our accountability.
