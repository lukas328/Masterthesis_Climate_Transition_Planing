As a local asset owner, we have a combination of local \nbusinesses that can invest both globally and locally. We believe \nwe are well positioned to have a positive local influence through \nthis avenue.  \nFor this to be successful, we believe in implementing a local \nengagement approach within emerging markets. This means actively \nengaging with companies in a constructive way that acknowledges \nthe specific circumstances and complexity of challenges. Where \nfeasible, we aim to include local portfolio managers in corporate \nengagements in that country; recognising the benefits of a shared \nlanguage, culture and experience. \nAs part of the Emerging Markets Transition Investment (EMTI) \nproject that we started within the NZAOA, we helped develop the \npaper ‘Call for Action on Responsible Corporate Engagement in \nEmerging Markets’. This sets out the following guiding principles \nfor responsible and effective engagement in emerging markets: \n1  Establish a local approach with an appreciation for the \ncomplexity and variation of challenges; \n2  Integrate the ‘common but differentiated responsibilities’ \nprinciple of the Paris Agreement into the engagement approach, \nby adjusting asks to locally specific social factors and the aspects \naround just transition.’\n3  Be prepared for ongoing engagement, with sustained dialogue to \nbuild trust;  \n4  Commit to knowledge sharing between global and local investors; \nand   \n5 B e flexible with the engagement ask – consider the practicalities \naround ambitious target setting. \nWe are aiming to further develop our strategy on engagement which \noutlines our specific approach, and also includes policy engagement. \nWe are also seeking to develop market-specific responsible \ninvestment approaches which will supplement the Group Responsible \nInvestment policy. These approaches will be more focused on the \nspecific challenges and opportunities in the local market, and aim to \nplay to our specific strengths in each market. \nImplementation and engagement strategy / continued\n 13\nPrudential plc Climate Transition Plan  \nImplementation and engagement strategy / continued\nSectoral decarbonisation\nDuring 2022, we established an internal cross-functional sectoral \ndecarbonisation working group with the aim of formulating sectoral \napproaches to inform investment decisions and engagement on \nclimate change, particularly within emerging markets. \nThe working group explored a range of sectoral decarbonisation \npathways and toolkits, and chose the Transition Pathway Initiative \n(TPI) which allows the assessment of companies based on an \nIEA-aligned 1.5°C scenario, a below 2°C scenario, and a national \npledges scenario. As data coverage across emerging markets can be \na challenge for Prudential, we commenced the development of an \ninternal tool to complement the TPI tool. When it is ready, the tool will \nbe made available across the organisation, including to investment \nteams within the local businesses. \nAdditionally, the working group assessed sectoral engagement \nquestions from leading industry sources. Based on this analysis, they \nfocused on developing a list of sector-specific engagement questions \nfor the utilities sector, designed to elicit a higher quality engagement \nresponse, and ultimately improve the decarbonisation progress. \nMoving forward, the working group will aim to formulate further \nsector-specific engagement approaches for the five most carbon \nintensive sectors in the investment portfolio.  \nIndustry engagement and advocacy\nWith operations exclusively in Asia and Africa, we are well placed to \nbring an emerging markets perspective to stakeholder discussions, to \nhelp ensure the need for a just and inclusive transition in developing \nmarkets is considered across the industry, and in a policy and \nregulatory context.  \nIn 2022 we built on our existing outreach and focus, bringing an \nemerging market perspective to our wide range of policy discussions \non the role of the finance community in a transition to a net-zero \nworld. \nPolicy and regulatory engagement\nWe regularly engage with regulators and monitor evolving climate \nrisk-related initiatives that could develop into new regulation in the \nmarkets in which we operate.
