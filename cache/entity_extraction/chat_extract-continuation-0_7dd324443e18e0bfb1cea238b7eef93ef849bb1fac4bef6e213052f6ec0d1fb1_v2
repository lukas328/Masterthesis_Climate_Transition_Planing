In 2021, we \ncompleted a materiality assessment to ensure that \nour sustainability strategy focuses on the right areas, \nreflecting changes to the business and the external \nenvironment. In collaboration with an independent \nconsultancy, and through consultation with a range \nof internal and external stakeholders, the assessment \nidentified 19 material issues across ESG topics that \nhave the greatest potential to impact the business, \neither as a risk or opportunity, and matter most to \nour stakeholders. This provided five topics of highest \nstrategic importance to lay the foundations of our \nsustainability strategy, mapped to the UN Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals: \n▪ One health (or the intersection of people and \nplanet health) \n▪ Climate change \n▪ Workplace physical and mental wellbeing \n▪ Healthy and sustainable lifestyles \n▪ ESG governance and transparency. \nThe Committee agreed that the results of the \nmateriality assessment highlighted the need to \nlook after people's health by addressing the health \nof our planet – supporting Bupa's expanded purpose. \nThis approach led to the three pillars of the \nsustainability strategy: Mission Zero, Mission Accelerate \nand Mission Regenerate. Further details of the \nsustainability strategy can be found in the Sustainability \nand ESG section on page 22 and here on bupa.com. \nThe Committee recommended the sustainability \nstrategy to the Board, which approved it in early 2022, \nand information on how stakeholder views were taken \ninto account in determining the sustainability strategy \nare detailed in the Section 172 statement on page 36. \nMission Zero \nAs disclosed in the 2021 Annual Report, Bupa has set \na 2040 net zero ambition for our global healthcare \noperations and value chain, including our investment \nportfolio. As a first step to achieving net zero emissions \nby 2040, we set 1.5°C aligned science-based targets. \nThese targets were validated by the SBTi in January \n2022. During the year, development of a global Scope \n1 and 2 decarbonisation roadmap began and the \nCommittee has received regular updates on the Group’s \nprogress to reduce Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions during \nthe year. The Committee was pleased to see that 84% \nof the electricity we use across our operations globally \nis now from renewable1 sources. More information on \nhow we have reduced GHG emissions during the year \ncan be found in the Sustainability and ESG section on \npage 22. \n1.

The \nCommittee recognises that core management initiatives \nsuch as Bupa’s digital transformation are a key part of \nreducing the Company’s environmental impact, but also \nrecognises the need to support others to do the same. \nThe Committee will continue to monitor management’s \nactions to ensure that Bupa remains on course to meet \nits net zero targets. \nThe SBTi requires us to disclose our year-on-year \nperformance against our chosen targets. It is important \nthat we produce good quality data to accurately \nmeasure our GHG emissions and progress against these \ntargets. The Committee felt that external assurance \nover our GHG emissions baseline and progress would \nprovide comfort to both the Committee and the Board, \nand our key stakeholders. The Committee therefore \nasked the Audit Committee to oversee the engagement \nof, and output from, an external provider and PwC \nwere appointed to carry out limited assurance over the \nGroup’s Scope 1, 2 and selected Scope 3 GHG emissions \nfor 2021. The Committee held a meeting jointly with the \nAudit Committee in November 2022 to assess progress \nof the Group’s 2021 GHG emissions disclosure and \nassurance from the second line of defence and PwC. \nThe final disclosure report and PwC’s limited assurance \nreport were reviewed by the Audit Committee in \nDecember 2022 and approved by the Board. For more \ninformation, see the Audit Committee’s report on page \n67.

The \nCommittee also received updates on the progress of \na trial deployment of sustainable scrubs and medical \nuniforms made by the 2021 eco-Disruptive winner \nCircoolar, in parts of Bupa’s Spanish business.
