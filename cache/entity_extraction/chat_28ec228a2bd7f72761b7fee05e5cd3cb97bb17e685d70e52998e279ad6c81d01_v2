Financial institutions should look to their \nnet-zero alliance and other guidance providers for \ngreater detail on how net-zero strategies can be \ndeveloped and implemented at the level of specific \nproducts, services, and transactions.  \nLiving guidance: GFANZ acknowledges that \nsupporting pathways, tools, and methodologies \nmay not yet be available for all situations and \npolicy, regulation, technology, and science are \nevolving, often at a rapid pace. As financial \ninstitutions develop and execute net-zero transition \nplans more widely, we expect the necessary tools, \nmethodologies, and datasets to further develop.\nCONTENTS  |  FINANCIAL INSTITUTION NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLANS — FUNDAMENTALS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND GUIDANCE\nvi\nForeword from the co-chairs  \nand vice-chair of GFANZ \nMike Bloomberg\nCo-Chair, GFANZ and UN  \nSpecial Envoy on Climate  \nAmbition and Solutions\nMark Carney\nCo-Chair, GFANZ and UN  \nSpecial Envoy for Climate  \nAction and Finance\nMary Schapiro\nVice Chair, GFANZ and  \nHead, GFANZ Secretariat  \n \nSince it was launched in April 2021, the Glasgow \nFinancial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) has been \ndeveloping tools and methodologies to support \nfinancial institutions’ efforts to turn net-zero \ncommitments into real action. With this report, \nwe are pleased to provide a framework that \noffers resources and considerations for financial \ninstitution net-zero transition plans, in support \nof the financial sector’s efforts turning net-zero \ncommitment into financial decision-making \nand support the orderly transition of the global \neconomy to net zero.\nBy now, the financial and economic risks posed \nby climate change and the measures necessary \nto mitigate it are readily apparent. The science \nis clear: To have a 50% chance of keeping global \nwarming to 1.5 degrees C and avoiding the worst \nimpacts of climate change, we must achieve about \na 50% reduction in emissions by 2030. Current  \n \n \nchallenges in the global energy market, significantly \nexacerbated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, \nhave highlighted the complexity and imperative of \nsecuring an orderly transition, including the need to \nrapidly scale climate solutions to provide cleaner, \nmore affordable, and more reliable replacements \nfor unabated fossil fuels.\nThis transition to net zero requires companies \nacross the whole economy to change behaviors \nthrough application of innovative technologies \nand new ways of doing business. At the same time, \nthe transition should be a just one, accounting for \nimpacts on cost of living, communities and workers. \nIt should also protect nature and biodiversity given \ntheir close connection to climate. All corners of the \nfinancial sector will play a pivotal role in enabling \nsuch a whole-economy transition — from firms that \noversee global capital allocation, financing, and \nrisk management to those that supply them with \nservices, advice, and systems.\n\nCONTENTS  |  FINANCIAL INSTITUTION NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLANS — FUNDAMENTALS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND GUIDANCE\nvii\nThe 550+ members of the sector-specific alliances \nthat comprise GFANZ have all committed to \naddressing the financial and economic risks and \nopportunities involved in achieving net zero. \nTranslating these long-term commitments into \naction requires clear, detailed plans to help ensure \nthe steps taken by the financial sector result in \nreal-economy emissions reductions. The voluntary \nrecommendations, to be implemented by each \nfinancial institution according to its role and \nbusiness model, and guidance in this framework \nprovide a set of resources and considerations \nfor financial institutions for the financing and \nenablement of climate solutions, firms that are \ntransitioning, and the managed phaseout of  \nhigh-emitting physical assets. \nBy establishing a pan-financial sector approach to \ntransition planning, to the extent possible, taking \ninto consideration each financial institution 's \nspecific function in the financial sector, GFANZ \naims to help financial institutions tackle joint \nchallenges in a consistent way. This also enables \ncomparability across the sector as stakeholders \nwork to hold financial institutions accountable  \nto their commitments. GFANZ believes this  \npan-financial sector framework will provide \npolicymakers and regulators with the necessary \ninsights to better understand efforts to mitigate \nclimate-related risk, and to assess progress \ntoward realizing national climate commitments. \nThe framework also provides governments and \nstandard-setters with a common global approach \nto inform disclosure guidance to further improve \ntransparency and accountability.\nWe would like to acknowledge and express our \ngratitude to the numerous organizations which \nproduced the resources highlighted throughout this \nreport and especially thank the many individuals \nand institutions who have volunteered their time \nin developing this framework. In particular, we \nare grateful to Aviva and HSBC, which co-led the \nworkstream that developed this  report.\nWe trust that financial institutions will find this \nreport helpful in developing their transition plans, \nand encourage policymakers and regulators to \nreference this report as they consider policy \nregarding transition plans for the financial sector. \nviii\nFINANCIAL INSTITUTION NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLANS — FUNDAMENTALS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND GUIDANCE\nContents\nPART A: INTRODUCTION  1\nBackground and rationale  2\nThis report 4\nPART B: NET-ZERO TRANSITION FOR THE FINANCIAL SECTOR  7\nDefining transition finance  8\nNet-zero transition plans  14\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
