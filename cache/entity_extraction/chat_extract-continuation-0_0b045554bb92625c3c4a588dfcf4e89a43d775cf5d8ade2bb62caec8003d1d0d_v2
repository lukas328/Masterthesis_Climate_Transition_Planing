These contracts \nmainly relate to the administration of claims funds on behalf of corporate customers. Revenues from service \ncontracts are recognised as the services are provided. Some of these contracts contain financial liabilities \nrepresenting deposits repayable to the customer. These are measured at amortised cost. \nOther revenue Other revenue comprises: \n▪ Rental income and amenities fees from occupational right agreements, which are recognised on a straight-line \nbasis over the term of the arrangement. \n▪ Imputed interest on interest-free refundable accommodation deposits (RADs) in respect of payments for aged \ncare units in Bupa Villages and Aged Care Australia. Revenue is recognised for the imputed interest on RADs, \nreflecting the Group's position as lessor. Use of the Maximum Permissible Interest Rate (MPIR) is considered most \nappropriate to determine the imputed revenue and interest amounts. The MPIR is a rate set by the Australian \nGovernment and is used to calculate the Daily Accommodation Payment to applicable residents. \n▪ Government funding received in response to COVID-19, most notably in Bupa Villages and Aged Care Australia \nand Hong Kong. Such funding is recognised when it is considered reasonably certain that the funding will be \nreceived and all necessary conditions have been complied with. \nBupa Annual Report 2022 135 \n
