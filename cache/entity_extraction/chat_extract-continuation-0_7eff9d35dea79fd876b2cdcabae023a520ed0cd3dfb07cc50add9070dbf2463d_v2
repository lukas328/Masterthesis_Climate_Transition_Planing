We will continue to \nundertake our programme of carbon \nreduction to minimise absolute \nemissions and therefore the level  \nof carbon removal credits required  \nto reach net zero.\nOur operational decarbonisation strategy is focused \non reducing emissions as much as possible by \nfocusing on the best practice principles of \nelimination first followed by reduction activities and \nreplacements before compensating for what is left.\nOur decarbonisation strategy is underpinned by \nour Environmental Management System, which we \nupdated in 2021 to align with ISO 14001. We also \nbegan the formal ISO accreditation process in 2022. \nOur strategic efforts so far mean that we have met \nand exceeded our 2025 target Scope 1 and 2 SBTi \ntrajectory targets (4,897 tCO2) early as shown in \nfigure 27. This allows us to take stock of our successes \nand focus on monitoring and refining our approach \nto decarbonisation across other Scope categories \nwith priority given to business travel emissions which \nhave increased in recent years as our business has \ngrown and travel restrictions have lifted. \nFollowing the release of the SBTi guidance and \nstandards for financial institutions to align \ninvestment targets in a consistent manner, we made \nthe decision to consider all investment property \nportfolios managed by our asset management \npartners as indirect emissions to be included in \nScope 3 category 15. We also adopted the \n‘operational approach for consolidation’ as \nreferenced in the PCAF Global Carbon \nAccounting and Reporting Standard for the \nFinancial Industry. This standard refines and \nextends the GHG Protocol’s accounting rules  \nfor Scope 3, category 15 (investments). \nThis action has also contributed to the reduction of \nthe Scope 1 and 2 emissions in 2022. Prior to 2022, a \nportion of assets within the investment property \nportfolios were accounted for as direct (Scope 1 and \n2). The approach for those assets was historically \nthat of financial control. Concurrently, reporting of \nproperties managed by other asset management \npartners was reported under operational control. \nAs of 2022 and to provide consistency, any direct \ninvestment assets, including those that historically \nadopted a financial control approach, will now \nbe reviewed through a number of appropriate \noperational control screening questions and will \nbe reported accordingly. \nWe will update on our progress in our annual \nClimate Report with emissions data published via \nour Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting  \nin our Annual Report and Accounts.\nRead our Annual Report  \nWe intend to use our intensity metrics as well as \nincreased data granularity and scope to identify \nfocus areas to reduce our carbon emissions across \nour operations, including aspects such as use of \nconsumables and waste generation and circular \neconomy practices.\nFurther next steps on our journey  \nto net zero operations\nA specific focus in 2023 and beyond is the \nupgrading of our occupied premises estate with \nthe latest heating and energy management \nsystems in line with the replacement cycle to \nreduce energy usage. We intend to join the \nClimate Group 100’s EP100 in 2023 given our \ncommitment to increasing our energy productivity.\nWe are also committed to encourage behavioural \nchange amongst our colleagues through the \nembedding of our Group Green Travel Policy to \nencourage utilisation of technology to reduce the \nneed to travel, and adoption of public transport on \nthe key routes between our major Edinburgh, \nWythall and London offices. \nThese activities will reduce the need for carbon \nremoval credits required in 2025. We plan to \nreview potential suppliers over the course of 2023 \nand 2024 ahead of purchasing ‘high quality’ \ncarbon credits generated from carbon removal \nprojects in 2025 to achieve our net zero goal. \nFigure 27: Absolute Carbon Reduction Targets – Scope 1 & 2\n0\n1,000\n2,000\n3,000\n4,000\n5,000\n6,000\n7,000\n8,000\n9,000\n203020292028202720262025202420232022202120202019\n7,905 8,178\n2,692\n2,391\ntCO 2\nYear\n2025 \ntarget \n4,897 tCO2\n Annual carbon performance (market-based)  \n SBTi target (market-based)\nMonitor and refine\nOperations \n59\nPhoenix Group Holdings plc Net Zero Transition Plan\nInvest Engage Lead\nEmbedding net zero \nin our business\nBecoming a \nnet zero business Measuring our progress\nExecutive \nsummary\n0%\n10%\n20%\n30\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PHOENIX GROUP HOLDINGS PLC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A financial services company committed to achieving net zero emissions through strategic decarbonization, environmental management, and investment in carbon removal projects)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ISO 14001<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An international standard for environmental management systems, which Phoenix Group Holdings updated its Environmental Management System to align with in 2021)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SBTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Science Based Targets initiative, which provides guidance and standards for companies to set emission reduction targets aligned with climate science)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CO2<|>GEO<|>Carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas targeted for reduction through various climate solutions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Scope 1<|>EVENT<|>Direct emissions from owned or controlled sources by Phoenix Group Holdings)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Scope 2<|>EVENT<|>Indirect emissions from the generation of purchased electricity, steam, heating, and cooling consumed by Phoenix Group Holdings)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Scope 3<|>EVENT<|>Other indirect emissions, including those from investment property portfolios managed by asset management partners)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Carbon Capture, Utilisation, and Storage (CCUS)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Technology-based solution providing permanent removal and artificial sequestration of CO2)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Direct Air Capture (DAC)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Technology-based solution involving capturing CO2 directly from the atmosphere for sequestration or utilization)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Technology-based solution combining bioenergy production with carbon capture to achieve negative emissions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Climate Group 100<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Global initiative that Phoenix Group plans to join in 2023 to improve energy productivity)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WETLANDS<|>GEO<|>Natural landscapes that can increase carbon storage and are part of natural climate solutions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAND MANAGEMENT<|>EVENT<|>Activities aimed at conserving, restoring, and managing land to enhance carbon sequestration and reduce emissions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Carbon Removal Projects<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Projects aimed at removing CO2 from the atmosphere, which Phoenix Group plans to purchase credits from in 2025)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PHOENIX GROUP HOLDINGS PLC<|>ISO 14001<|>Phoenix updated its Environmental Management System to align with ISO 14001<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PHOENIX GROUP HOLDINGS PLC<|>SBTI<|>Phoenix adopted SBTi standards for setting emission reduction targets<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PHOENIX GROUP HOLDINGS PLC<|>CO2<|>Phoenix aims to reduce CO2 emissions through various strategies<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PHOENIX GROUP HOLDINGS PLC<|>Scope 1<|>Direct emissions from Phoenix's owned sources<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PHOENIX GROUP HOLDINGS PLC<|>Scope 2<|>Indirect emissions from purchased energy<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PHOENIX GROUP HOLDINGS PLC<|>Scope 3<|>Emissions from investment property portfolios managed by asset management partners<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CCUS<|>Technology-based solutions<|>Provides permanent removal and artificial sequestration of CO2<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DAC<|>Technology-based solutions<|>Captures atmospheric CO2 directly<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BECCS<|>Technology-based solutions<|>Combines bioenergy with carbon capture<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PHOENIX GROUP HOLDINGS PLC<|>WETLANDS<|>Natural landscapes that can increase carbon storage<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PHOENIX GROUP HOLDINGS PLC<|>LAND MANAGEMENT<|>Activities to conserve and restore land for carbon sequestration<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PHOENIX GROUP HOLDINGS PLC<|>Carbon Removal Projects<|>Planned purchase of credits in 2025<|>3)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
