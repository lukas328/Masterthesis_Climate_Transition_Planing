We have had \nno fatalities since 2015.\nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 2023 33\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTSOTHER INFORMATION\nSustainability continued\nGlobal Safety Day\nAs part of the new strategy introduced \nby our CEO in last year’s report, just like \nthe rest of our business, 2022/23 saw all \nour line managers and our EHS team \nexamine our approach to ensuring the \nsafety of our people. \nOur first annual Global Safety Day was a \nhuge success – helping to bring our \norganisational transformation to life by \nproviding site managers with resources \nand insights into overcoming common \nbarriers to workplace safety. Dedicating \na specific day to safety across the whole \norganisation helped focus everyone’s \nminds on the importance of safety in \neverything we do and create an \nopportunity to celebrate our \nperformance and efforts taken in \nsupport of safety.\nThe event was attended by all \nemployees, who took part in activities \nand talks around the central theme of \nhow to have effective safety \nconversations. The global event was \nbolstered by two regional EHS \nconferences which were attended by site \nmanagers and other key functional \npeople with the main theme around \nsafety leadership.\nStronger audits. Stronger oversight \nThis year saw a return to full on-site auditing as COVID-related restrictions relaxed globally.  \nA total of 17 corporate audits were undertaken during 2022/23. These included four  \nProcess Safety-specific audits. All of our high hazard facilities have now been subject to \na formal corporate environmental, health and safety (EHS) audit within the last three years \nand a process safety audit within the last five years.\nAn independent review and audit of the JM Process Safety Management System, sponsored \nby the JM Board, has been timetabled for 2023/24 in order to assess the prioritisation  \nof programme implementation and major risk management. The review comprises a review  \nof the corporate process safety systems against industry best practices plus more focused \nengagements at selected JM sites to audit implementation and progress on recommendations \nto address the major process safety risks. \nPeople: Promoting a safe, diverse and equitable society continued\nOur process safety performance \nOur International Council of Chemicals Association (ICCA) process safety event severity rate \n(PSESR) has decreased by 23% from 1.321 last year to 1.02 PSESR per 200,000 hours worked. \nThere were nine Tier 1 process safety events this year, compared to 11 the previous year. See \nBasis of reporting on page 227 for a definition of a Tier 1 process safety event. \nWe continue to embed process safety training across JM. In the last 3 years safety training has \nbeen completed by over 2,870 operations-based staff, which is c. 90% of employees who \nhave been identified as needing process safety training. We have also completed individual \nprocess safety competency assessments for 305 managers and engineers in process safety-\ncritical roles at facilities rated as ‘high hazard’. All roles that have been identified in this \ncategory, for our high hazard sites, have now been trained.\nDespite these improvements, a significant explosion occurred at one of our US sites \nin July 2022. Thankfully the incident resulted in no injuries, but we did receive a citation \nfrom the regulator and the site’s performance remains impacted. Our investigation and \nroot cause analysis highlighted several areas that could be improved – and we continue \nto implement those changes.\n1.
