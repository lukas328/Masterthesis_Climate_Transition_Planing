Any disposals are expected to be infrequent or insignificant. The investments are \nmeasured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses. Any \ndiscount or premium on purchase is amortised over the life of the investment in the Consolidated \nIncome Statement. \nUnder IFRS 9, impairment provisions for expected credit losses (ECL) are recognised for financial investments \nmeasured at amortised cost and FVOCI. An allowance for either a 12-month or lifetime ECL is required, depending \non whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. For trade receivables lifetime \nECL is always applied. An assumption can be made that the credit risk on a financial instrument has not increased \nsignificantly since initial recognition if the financial instrument is determined to have low credit risk at the reporting \ndate (e.g. it is investment grade). The Group applies a 12-month ECL allowance to all assets other than trade \nreceivables, as no significant increases in credit risk since initial recognition have been identified. \nThe measurement of ECL should reflect a probability-weighted outcome, the time value of money and the best \navailable forward-looking information. An analysis of ECL provisions is provided in Note 26.3. \nFinancial investments are analysed as follows: \nCarrying value \n2022 \n£m \nFair value \n2022 \n£m \nCarrying value \n2021 \n£m \nFair value \n2021 \n£m \nFair value through profit or loss \nCorporate debt securities and secured loans 301 301 334 334 \nGovernment debt securities 41 41 45 45 \nPooled investment funds 459 459 386 386 \nDeposits with credit institutions 4 4 – – \nOther loans 7 7 7 7 \nEquities 32 32 13 13 \nFair value through other comprehensive income \nCorporate debt securities and secured loans 41 41 66 66 \nGovernment debt securities 19 19 30 30 \nAmortised cost \nCorporate debt securities and secured loans 1,114 1,110 774 776 \nGovernment debt securities 468 468 211 214 \nDeposits with credit institutions 1,230 1,230 1,044 1,045 \nOther loans – – 1 1 \nTotal financial investments 3,716 3,712 2,911 2,917 \nNon-current 756 752 831 833 \nCurrent 2,960 2,960 2,080 2,084 \nFair value of financial investments \nFair value is a market-based measurement for assets for observable market transactions where market information \nmight be available.

The different levels are defined by reference to the lowest level input that is significant to the fair \nvalue measurement, as follows: \n▪ Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. \n▪ Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either \ndirectly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). \n▪ Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). \nAn analysis of the fair value of financial investments
