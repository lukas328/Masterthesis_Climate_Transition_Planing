Therefore, for the automotive sector , only Scope 3 Category 11: Use of Sold Products is \nincluded in the Scope 3 financed emissions calculations. Auto manufacturers report their Scope 3 tailpipe \nemissions in two ways, using a Well-to-Wheel (WTW) methodology or using a Tank-to-Wheel (TTW) \nmethodology. Well-to-Wheel calculations capture combustion of fuel over the lifetime of a vehicle as well as \nupstream emissions associated with fuel extraction and transport. Tank-to-Wheel calculations only capture \nthe end use combustion of the fuel in the vehicle’s tank over its lifetime.  \nWe calculate Scope 3 tailpipe emissions using a hybrid approach, deferring to the public disclosures made \nby parent companies, despite inconsistent approaches (e.g., TTW or WTW), using publicly reported data \nprovided by S&P Global Trucost, and using a bottom-up, production-based approach when neither S&P \nGlobal Trucost nor publicly disclosed data is available. The bottom-up calculation, shown below, uses make, \nmodel and body data from LMC, regional lifetime kilometer assumptions, EPA emissions factors and fuel \nefficiency data from Fueleconomy.gov:\nwith l = location\nwith v = vehicle\nThe equation captures parent company fleet emissions over the lifetime of the fleet. The vehicle units \nand their corresponding fuel efficiency provide a metric measuring kilometers traveled per gallon of \nfuel consumed. Total gallons consumed over the life of the vehicle were determined using the average \nlifetime kilometer metric. Finally, a fuel combustion emissions factor was applied to total lifetime gallons \nconsumed. Equation inputs and their associated assumptions are further discussed below.\nTailpipe CO2e emissions ∑ X X XVehicle UnitsV\nV\nFuel EfficiencyV Avg lifetime kmV Emissions Factorl=\nTCFD REPORT 2022: CITI’S APPROACH TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND NET ZERO | 73\nFor clients that produce only electric vehicles, we treat their tailpipe emissions associated with EV battery \ncharging as zero, as emissions from battery charging are covered by the electric power generators in the \nPower sector .\nEnergy\nFor details on our Energy Scope 3 calculation methodology, please see our 2021 TCFD Report. \nSteel\nFor Steel sector loans, there is a high degree of variability in Scope 3 emissions given the complexity of \nfinal steel product manufacturing processes and the variation among different steel plants (e.g., integrated \nvs. non-integrated steel plants). The SSP fixed system boundary includes upstream Scope 3 emissions, \nCategory 1 – purchased goods and services, and downstream Scope 3 emissions, Category 10 – processing \nof sold products. FY2020 Scope 3, Category 1 emissions were obtained through CDP disclosures, when \navailable. Where data was unavailable through CDP, upstream and downstream Scope 3 emissions were \nobtained through S&P Global Trucost, when available. \nWhen using S&P Global Trucost data, Scope 3 emissions are broken down into “upstream” and “downstream,” \nnot by category. As such, applying S&P Global Trucost Scope 3 emissions data for financed emissions \ncalculations leads to an overestimation of financed Scope 3 emissions compared to the SSP boundary.\nThermal Coal Mining\nThermal coal product combustion Scope 3 emissions are the most carbon-intensive segment of the thermal \ncoal mining value chain. These emissions belong to Scope 3, Category 11, and are considered “downstream” \nin the value chain. To calculate these emissions, we use S&P Global Trucost downstream Scope 3 \nemissions data, where available, and for companies that do not have S&P Global Trucost data available, \nor the emissions values are estimated by S&P, a bottom-up approach is applied by using thermal coal \nsales figures, sourced through company sustainability reports and/or annual reports, and United States \nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) emissions factors. \nFor the bottom-up approach, thermal coal combustion emissions were calculated using the following formula.\nwith c = company\nTons of thermal coal sold\nThermal coal sales values for CY2020 are sourced through companies’ sustainability reports or annual \nreports. For companies that do not report coal sales by type, a thermal coal sales ratio is used to calculate \nthermal coal sales.\nCombustion emissions CO2e ∑ XTons of thermal coal soldc\nC\nEmissions Factor=\n74 | TCFD REPORT\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
