As we deem it to be \nnecessary we also instruct third party legal experts to support an independent assessment \nof possible outcomes of claims. \nWhere material settlements have occurred we have agreed these to settlement agreements \nbetween the company and the claimant. \nWe have assessed the level of provisioning and contingent liability disclosures, where relevant, \nin response to known claims. \nBased on the procedures performed, we noted no material issues arising from our work.\nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 2023 137\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION\nIndependent auditors’ report to the members of Johnson Matthey Plc continued\nHow we tailored the audit scope\nWe tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able \nto give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure \nof the group and the company, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in \nwhich they operate.\nThe group is structured across five sectors: Clean Air, PGM Services, Catalyst Technologies, \nHydrogen Technologies and Value Businesses, as well as the central Corporate unit.\nThe financial statements are a consolidation of approximately 230 business units. We have \nidentified each individual business unit, or a series of business units where they map to \na single legal statutory entity, as a component. These components comprise the group’s \noperating businesses and holding companies across the five sectors and corporate.\nBased on our risk and materiality assessments, we determined which components required \nan audit of their complete financial information having considered the relative significance \nof each entity to the group, locations with significant inherent risks and the overall coverage \nobtained over each material line item in the consolidated financial statements.\nWe identified 23 business units which, in our view, required an audit of their complete \nfinancial information, due to size or risk characteristics.\nIn addition to the business units in full scope, we performed specified procedures or audit \nof specified financial statement line items at 9 business units covering revenue, trade and \nother receivables and deferred income, cash, inventory, metal inventory, accruals, fixed assets \nand depreciation, cost of sales and operating expenses and tested manual journal entries. \nThis ensured that appropriate audit procedures were performed to achieve sufficient coverage \nover these financial statement line items.\nThe total 32 in‑scope business units are located in numerous countries around the world. \nWe used local teams in these countries to perform the relevant audit procedures. Of these, \nthree business units have been determined to be financially significant based on their \ncontribution to the group. These financially significant component teams are located \nin the UK and Macedonia.\nThe group consolidation, financial statement disclosures and corporate functions were \naudited by the group audit team. This included our work over the consolidation, litigation \nprovisions, centrally recognised tax balances, goodwill, post‑retirement benefits, earnings \nper share and treasury related balances. This scope of work, together with additional \nprocedures performed at the group level, accounted for 83% of group revenue and 71% \nof group underlying profit before taxation from continuing operations. This provided the \nevidence we needed for our opinion on the consolidated financial statements taken as a \nwhole. This was before considering the contribution to our audit evidence from performing \naudit work at the group level, including disaggregated analytical review procedures, which \ncovers certain of the group’s smaller and lower risk components that were not directly \nincluded in our group audit scope.\nThe impact of climate risk on our audit\nClimate change is expected to present both risks and opportunities for the group. \nAs explained in the Sustainability section of the Strategic Report , the group is mindful \nof its impact on the environment and is focussed on ways to reduce climate‑related impacts \nas management continues to develop its plans towards a Net Zero pathway by 2040. \nManagement’s climate change initiatives and commitments will impact the group in a variety \nof ways, and while the group has started to quantify some of the impacts that may arise \non its net zero pathway, the future financial impacts are clearly uncertain given the medium \nto long term horizon. Disclosure of the impact of climate change risk based on management’s \ncurrent assessment is incorporated in the Task Force on climate related financial disclosures \n(‘TCFD’) section of the Annual Report.\nAs part of our audit, we made enquiries of management to understand the extent of the \npotential impact of climate change on the group’s business and the financial statements, \nincluding reviewing management’s climate change risk assessment which was prepared with \nsupport from an external expert. We used our knowledge of the group to evaluate the risk \nassessment performed by management.\nWe assessed that the key areas in the financial statements which are more likely to be \nmaterially impacted by climate change are those areas that are based on future cash flows. \nAs a result, we particularly considered how climate change risks and the impact of climate \ncommitments made by the group would impact the assumptions made in the forecasts \nprepared by management that are used in the group’s impairment analysis (see also key audit \nmatter on Carrying value of goodwill) and for going concern purposes. We challenged how \nmanagement had considered longer term physical risks such as severe weather related \nimpacts, and shorter‑term transitional risks such as the introduction of carbon taxes. \nOur procedures did not identify any material impact on our audit for the year ended 31 March \n2023. We also checked the consistency of the disclosures in the TCFD section of the Annual \nReport with the relevant financial statement disclosures, including notes 1 and the going \nconcern section of the accounting policies, and\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
