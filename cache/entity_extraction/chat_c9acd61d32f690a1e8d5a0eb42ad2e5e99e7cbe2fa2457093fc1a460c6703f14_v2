mining company deriving ≥25% of its revenue from thermal coal mining.\n44 | TCFD REPORT 2022: CITI’S APPROACH TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND NET ZERO\nOur net zero target for the Thermal Coal Mining sector builds upon our ESRM Policy on Coal but brings \nmore companies in scope for calculating and reporting on our financed emissions. As further detailed in \nthe “Strategy” section of this Report, Citi has adjusted the boundary of our net zero target for the Thermal \nCoal Mining sector to include those companies that derive ≥5% of their revenue from thermal coal mining. \nFossil Fuel Financing  \nCurrently, fossil fuels are a driver of the global economy and continue to be a major component of \nthe world’s energy portfolio. However , meeting global net zero commitments in line with the Paris \nAgreement will require emissions to be drastically reduced during this decade. The expected shift \naway from fossil fuels globally, in pursuit of renewable and alternative energy, will have a significant \neffect on clients in carbon-intensive sectors — including coal mining, power generation and certain \nsegments of the energy sector .\nThe financial services sector can play a significant role helping to enable low-carbon business models. \nAs a global bank with exposure to many carbon-intensive segments of the economy, and as a top \nlender to the energy sector in particular , Citi has an opportunity and a responsibility to support our \nclients in their transition. As such, client engagement and transition are a key component of our net \nzero commitment. Our philosophy is to meet our clients where they are and help them identify areas \nwhere they can decarbonize. We ask our clients: What is your short-term decarbonization and longer-\nterm transition plan? What is your pathway? What are your metrics? What is your capital expenditure \nstrategy, and how are you allocating capital to help transition to a low-carbon business model?\nEnergy is one sector where transition considerations are particularly complex. Currently, we are seeing \ninteresting developments among the largest integrated oil and gas companies, which are investing in \ntechnologies that leverage their current technical expertise and capabilities, ranging from offshore \nwind development, to biofuels, to hydrogen, to carbon removal technology. Other clients, however , have \nless ability today to branch out from oil and gas production, and instead are focusing on decarbonizing \ntheir operations. Although we acknowledge that operational Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions are a \nfraction of the Scope 3 GHG emissions from the combustion of oil and gas, we also believe that any \nefforts to decarbonize today, for example by increasing operational efficiency or decreasing methane \nemissions, amount to real GHG emissions reductions and climate benefits, and provide some clients \nwith a foothold to make progress and potentially identify further opportunities for decarbonization.\nThermal Coal Mining Exposure \n2020 Baseline Credit Exposure as of YE 2021 Credit Exposure as of YE 2022\n$1.091 billion $765 million* \n(30% reduction from baseline)\n$ 586 million\n(46% reduction from baseline)\n *This figure has been updated as part of a facility-level data review exercise that identified a few facilities that were excluded from the \noriginally reported exposure.\nTCFD REPORT 2022: CITI’S APPROACH TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND NET ZERO | 45\nScenario Analysis   \nCiti uses climate risk scenario analysis, including stress testing, to assess the potential impact of climate-\nrelated risk drivers on Citi’s risk profile across a range of plausible climate-related pathways. Climate change \nis expected to have far-reaching systemic impacts in breadth and magnitude, affecting governments, \nbusinesses and households across all geographies and sectors.\nThe associated effects are expected to feed through the economy via two principal channels — transition and \nphysical risks — which are both characterized by deep uncertainty and non-linearity:\n • Transition Risks arise from the process of adjusting toward a low-carbon economy and encompass \npolicy and legal changes, technological changes, and shifting consumer/market sentiment and \nsocietal preferences and \n • Physical Risks arise through “acute” weather-related events\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
