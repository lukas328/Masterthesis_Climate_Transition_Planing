We have been able to \nreact to some of the challenges people across our \ncommunities faced in 2022/23.\nThe impacts of the cost-of-living crisis caused by rising inflation and energy costs have been \nfelt across the world. As part of our response, we donated to six organisations tackling food \npoverty: The Trussell Trust, Feeding America, Stacja 6 – Fundacja, Fuel Macedonia, UNICEF \nIndia and Action Aid. We also responded to the Turkish and Syrian earthquake disaster with \na donation to The Disaster Emergency Committee appeal and matched any employee \ndonations to the appeal throughout February 2023.  \nOur people continued to offer their time to volunteer and have a direct impact on their local \ncommunities. This year, we recorded our strongest ever numbers of volunteering, and the \nfirst year where volunteering activity has exceeded pre-COVID levels. We recorded 2,063 days \nof volunteering overall, up 56% on the previous year, and our #JMVolunteers campaign saw \nover 800 of our people come together for two focused weeks of volunteering efforts in \nDecember 2022, across 33 sites and 14 countries. \nPeople: Promoting a safe, diverse and equitable society continued\nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 202342\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTSOTHER INFORMATION\nSustainability continued\nProviding shelter and support for Ukrainian refugees\nBuilding on our support for Ukraine from \nlast year, over 125 Johnson Matthey \nteam members in Gliwice, Poland, \njoined the local community to refurbish \na former school dormitory. The site can \nnow house up to 130 Ukrainian refugees \nin a safe, community-focused space.\nThe team also helped to renovate a \ncommunity centre for displaced children \nand turned an ice rink into a donation \nredistribution centre.

This allowed school learners to connect to \nand ask questions of a diverse range of STEM professions and engaged 2,179 learners aged \n10-18 years old from schools in Detroit, US and from state schools across the UK. \nOur STEM education efforts through Science and Me are on track to impact 24,000 students, \nand 118 teachers by the end of this calendar year. \nMoving into the next year, we will connect with local schools to widen our volunteering \nefforts, boost engagement as well as tap into opportunities such as micro-volunteering, which \nmeans offering shorter volunteering opportunities for example participating in a one-hour \nSTEM careers webinar.\n1.
