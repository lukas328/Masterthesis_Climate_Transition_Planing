Overview / Introduction \n  \nTCFD Report 2022  -7- \n \n2. Status of Mizuho’s response to TCFD Recommendations (Executive Summary)  \n(Underlined portions indicate initiatives that we have enhanced since our previous disclosure in June 2021.) \nGovernance Disclose the organization’s governance around climate-related risks and opportunities. \n Clarified Mizuho’s stance on climate change, our aims and actions, and our medium- to long-term strategy \nand initiatives through our Environmental Policy, Mizuho’s Approach to Achieving Net Zero by 2050, and \nNet Zero Transition Plan, which were approved by the Board of Directors. \n We built a supervision  and business execution governance framework that centers on the Board of \nDirectors.  \nSupervision: The Board of Directors and Risk Committee conduct oversight regarding information that is \nreported to them and deliberated following discussions at the business execution line. \nBusiness execution: The Sustainability Promotion Committee (established in FY2021) , Risk Management \nCommittee, and Executive Management Committee regularly deliberate and discuss, then report to the \nBoard of Directors. The Group Chief Strategy Officer and Group Chief Risk Officer move forward initiatives \nin each field under the management of the Group CEO. \n We have established a Climate Change Response Taskforce and five working groups (new i n FY2022) to \nenhance our promotion structure. \n Remuneration for corporate officers reflects the status of sustainability initiatives (including initiatives \naddressing climate change). In FY2022, we began utilizing external evaluations from ESG evaluation \nagencies. \npp. 21 – 22 \n \n \npp. 14 – 20 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \np. 19 \n \npp. 19 – 20 \n \nStrategy Disclose the actual and potential impacts of climate -related risks and opportunities on the organization’s \nbusinesses, strategy, and financial planning where such information is material. \n We have formulated the Net Zero Transition Plan , which clarifies our medium - to long-term strategy and \ninitiatives (April 2022). \n1. Net-zero greenhouse gas emissions: Become carbon neutral for Scope 1 and 2 (emissions from our \nown business activities) by FY2030, achieve net zero by 2050 for Scope 3 (emissions from financing \nand investment), and begin setting mid-term targets for Scope 3. \n2. Strengthening low-carbon business: Strengthen our support for the transition to a low-carbon society by \nengaging with clients and providing financial and non-financial solutions. \n3. Improving climate- related risk management: C ontinually enhance risk management frameworks and \npolicies that aim to create a business base resilient to climate change impacts. \n4. Strengthening our stance: Strengthen our stance on achieving net zero group- wide, focus on \nparticipating in international initiatives and coordinating with stakeholders. \n Risks and opportunities / responses: \n- We see client investment in technological and business model development that leads to decarbonization \nas an opportunity for Mizuho. \nWith engagement (constructive dialogue) as a starting point, we are supporting our clients’ transition to a \nlow-carbon society and their climate change countermeasures. \n Engagement with clients: Engaged with approx. 1,000 companies from the perspective of responsible \nfinancing and investment and with approx. 1,300 companies to promote clients’ sustainability initiatives. \n Provision of sustainable finance: FY2019 to  FY2021 total of ¥13.1 trillion (of which ¥4.6 trillion in \nenvironmental finance). \n Development and provision of new solutions meeting clients’ diversifying needs. \n Risks: \n- In terms of climate-related risks, we are taking into account both transition risks 1 and physical risks 2 \narising from climate change. \n- Transition risks: Credit risk related to financing and investment clients who are impacted by more stringent \ncarbon taxes, fuel efficiency regulations, or other policies or by delays in shifting to low-carbon and other \nenvironmental technologies. Operational risk related to reputational damage from financing fossil fuel \nprojects. \n- Physical risks: Acute risk in the form of  damage to our assets (such as data centers)  and to customer \nassets (such as real estate collateral), caused by extreme weather increasing the incidence of wind\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
