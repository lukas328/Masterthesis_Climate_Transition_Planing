We also apply actions to them in the sphere of \nthe Chain Monitoring Program, relating to sustainability, \ncompliance, legal compliance and human rights. \nIn the environmental sphere, we have an  area specifically \nworking on control and management in order to monitor \nsuppliers together with extension workers, these being \nemployees linked to livestock farming who make periodic \nvisits to rural properties focused on the production of \nanimals forming part of our chain. The issues of animal \nwelfare, that are central to compliance in our chain, are \nratified by audits, certification programs and commit-\nments linked to our Sustainability Plan (read more in \nAnimal Welfare).\nIn 2022, we trained around 750 extension workers, \nfocusing on work methodologies and expansion of \nthe business’ economic vision. One example of an \naction along these lines took place in May, in the form \nof a conference to which more than 70 supervisors \nbrought external speakers to address the business and \nrelationship vision, with the ultimate aim of expanding \nsustainability throughout our production chain.\nThe stability in the relationship with the Company could \nbe clearly seen in the results of the Satisfaction Survey \nundertaken with our integrated producers. Involving \nvoluntary participation by 5,229 producers (a number \ncorresponding to 55% of the total), the study recorded an \napproval index of 84.25% (higher than the 84% recorded \nin 2021). This result reinforced BRF’s relationship and \nintegration strategy with its principal stakeholder in the \narea of farming. We operate in line with the Integration \nLaw (in effect since May 2016), in such a way that its \napplication takes into consideration the due roles, respon-\nsibilities and attributes of each (integrator or integrated) \nplayer in the main elements of the system. \nAnother important highlight of the year was the \nexpansion of our payment policies based upon zootech-\nnical performance - thus encouraging our integrated \nproducers to continue with their efforts to optimize and \nmodernize their activities. \nIn August 2022, BRF took part in the 2022 edition of the \nInternational Poultry and Pork Show (SIAVS). At the event, \nour integrated producers had the opportunity to take \npart in forums of interest to them, involving speakers \non new technologies, clean energy and animal welfare \npractices. Furthermore, during the event, 49 partners \nreceived awards from the ‘5 Star Integrated Highlight’ \nprogram, which, now in its 15th edition, recognizes the \nbest integrated producers in each of BRF’s production \nsegments. \n100% \nof our integrated producers \nwere included in the sphere of the Chain \nMonitoring Program, relating to sustainability, \ncompliance, legal compliance and human rights.\n87\nValue Generation5\nOur way of \ndoing business\nOur strategy\nCulture and \nEngagement\nIndicators  \nand annex\n3\n4\n6\n2\nPresentation1\n2022 Integrated  \nReport\nManagement of the logistics chain\nAnother important group of suppliers is the cargo trans-\nportation providers, including both live cargo (animals \nfor farming and slaughter), raw-materials, consum-\nables and finished products. We have more than 22,700 \npartners (drivers and assistants) traveling more than 50 \nmillion kilometers per month in more than 50 countries \nin Europe, South Africa, Middle East, Asia, Americas and \nBrazil. \nWe have an Integrated Management of Suppliers \nProgram (GIF), an initiative that recognizes the perfor-\nmance of our partners in the form of annual awards. In \naddition to this is the Health, Safety and Environment \nin Transport Program (SSMA), the role of which is to \nreduce accidents and environmental impacts, combat the \nsexual exploitation of children and young people on the \nhighways and ensure dignity in the performance of the \ntruck driving profession. \nWith the support of an independent company, we control, \nmonitor and manage the routines of these transport \nprofessionals that are linked to the issue of personnel \nmanagement - such as, for example, vacations, admis-\nsions, dismissals and legal documentation such as the \nOccupational Health Certificate (ASO), toxicology exam \nand Brazilian Driving License (CNH). We also adopt \ntechnologies for purposes such as monitoring fatigue to \nensure compliance with the routines, and we have made \nimportant advances, such as, for example, a reduction in \nthe accident rate (read more in Health and Safety).\nAlso forming part of the responsibilities of the \nindependent company is the monitoring of the leading \nindicators related to personnel (such as turnover and \nabsenteeism) and climate studies aimed at identifying \nopportunities for improvement and greater appreciation \nand recognition for the workers employed by these trans-\nportation companies. Also worth mentioning is the fact \nthat BRF monitors the individual conduct of the drivers, \nwhose ratings may be reduced or they may be prevented \nfrom working for BRF for periods of between 15 days and \na year , should they be found to have committed irregular-\nities whilst providing services to the Company.\nBRF has more than 22,700 partners operating \nin the cargo transportation area.
