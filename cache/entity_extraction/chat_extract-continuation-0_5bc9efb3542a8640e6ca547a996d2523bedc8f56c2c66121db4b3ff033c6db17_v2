We \nadapt our engagement approach according to \nregional differences in governance and culture. \nTwo of the most significant engagements in the \nyear were with Sasol and Eskom; for details on the \nformer, to which we have exposure via both \nequity and fixed income, please see the ‘Proxy \nvoting’ section. \nSustainability and Stewardship Report\n37\nCase study:\nEskom: supporting South Africa’s \nenergy transition\nObjective Eskom has been one of the highest-emitting companies in our corporate \nportfolio since the inception of our net-zero strategy, producing 85% of its \nelectricity by coal-fired power generation. The company is South Africa’s sole \nenergy utility, and therefore a keystone in the South African economy – hence \nwhy this engagement is as much ‘social’ as ‘environmental’. During the reporting \nyear, our Eskom engagement priorities continued to be informed by our \nTransition Plan Assessment. They are: solvency first, without which the company \ncannot deliver a transition; stronger governance and transparent leadership; \nand publishing and implementing a credible transition plan that tackles energy \navailability, carbon emissions and justice for communities and workers.\nOutcome\n \nFrom our direct engagements, we have had positive responses from the \ncompany, specifically on the state of transmission unbundling and the \nbottleneck of grid connectivity hampering the ability of renewable power to \naccess the grid, as well as plans to manage and eventually overcome load \nshedding. Looking forward, we will continue to take an ‘all of landscape’ \nengagement approach. As well as direct engagements, we will engage \ncollaboratively via our co-leadership role with AB on the Climate Action 100+ \nengagement. Through this channel, we have interacted with the company on \nbehalf of several bondholders, and acted as a conduit for other investors who \ndo not have direct access. This is further supported by our policy and advocacy \nwork with various entities involved in supporting South Africa’s energy \ntransition, which includes:\n ɽ Informing policy via discussions with relevant South African entities, \nincluding National Treasury, the Ministry of Electricity and the Presidential \nClimate Commission \n ɽ Contributing to research on South Africa’s Just Transition plan via \nconsultation with the London School of Economics Just Transition \nFinance Lab\n ɽ Supporting local private sector initiatives, such as the National Business \nInitiative, that are driving the development of finance and policy \nroadmaps \n ɽ Bringing South Africa’s case to global climate finance discussions via our \ninvolvement in COP28 and other climate forums \n ɽ Informing foreign policy and finance discussions via engagement with \nthe UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office \nEnvironmental \nFixed Income\nSustainability and Stewardship Report\n38\nCase study:\nVale: engaging our top emitters\nObjective Driving down carbon emissions in the iron-ore industry is complex as most \nemissions are Scope 3, produced when the iron ore is turned into iron and \nthen steel. However, it is both possible and critical to do so. Our 4Factor team \nengaged with Vale, the world’s largest producer of iron ore and nickel, on \nkey areas for development identified in the company’s transition plan. These \nincluded: 1) publishing a clear governance plan for ESG and transition, tied \nto KPIs; 2) developing realistic Scope 3 targets, approved by SBTi; and 3) \ncontinued improvement on disclosure and actions taken to improve waste in \nthe value chain.\nOutcome\n \nVale has committed to net-zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2050. It is making \nprogress with electrification via its PowerShift programme, which aims to replace \nfossil fuels with clean sources in its operations. The company is trialling a 100% \nelectric truck in its mines, as well as using battery-powered locomotives and \nelectrical equipment in underground mines in Canada. \nIt has not yet set equivalently ambitious timelines and targets for Scope 3 – which \naccount for 98% of Vale’s emissions and are a huge challenge – as it wants to be \nconfident it can deliver on them. Currently, Vale is seeking to reduce Scope 3 by \n15% by 2035. During our engagement, the company highlighted the approaches \nit is taking to achieve this:\n ɽ Vale aims to shift its product portfolio towards higher quality iron ore. \nIts ‘green briquettes’ can reduce its steelmaking customers’ production-\nprocess emissions by 10%.\n ɽ  The company will report on how many of its customers have emissions\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"},
