Here are some details \non how we are working towards that goal. \nWe are committed to achieving our two major \nMission Zero milestones: a net zero business in Scope \n1 and 2 by 2030 and across all scopes by 2040. Visit \nBupa.com here for more information on our net zero \ncommitments, 1.5°C aligned Science Based Targets \n(SBTs) and interim target. For more information \nregarding our investment temperature alignment \nSBT, please see the Responsible investment section \non page 32. \nWe have identified the focal areas that are central \nto the delivery of Mission Zero, which include \ndecarbonisation of our own operations, our supply \nchain, and healthcare provision, as well as the \ndigitalisation of our products and services and delivery \nof sustainable healthcare. Action will therefore be \ntargeted towards these areas. \nOne of the key highlights from the past year involves \nthe increased use of renewable energy across our \nbusiness. In February 2022, we started the supply of \nrenewable electricity to all our Australian care homes \nand our corporate offices in Melbourne and Sydney, for \nthe next five years. This means that globally we now use \n84% renewable electricity across our operations.1 \n1.

This will allow us to identify our \nfocus for action and where core investment is needed \nin new technologies and energy reduction solutions. \nThis project will feed into the wider Climate Transition \nPlan (development due to commence in 2023) which \nwill outline our approach for transitioning to a zero-\ncarbon economy. In parallel, we have also built resource \nefficiency and decarbonisation plans into our three \nyear business planning cycle, enabling Market Units to \nidentify the investment needed to decarbonise in line \nwith our target to reduce our scope 1 and 2 greenhouse \ngas (GHG) emissions across our global operations by at \nleast 40% by 2025, and achieve our 2030 (scope 1 and \n2) and 2034 (scope 3) SBTs. \nWe have mobilised a new Group Investment Fund \n(GIF) over 2022-2025. This enables the making of \nstrategic investments to support the delivery of our \nsustainability strategy, such as investing in operational \ntransformation, decarbonisation of our operations and \nvalue chain, and investing in programmes that focus \non the interdependence between healthy lifestyles \nand healthy environments to develop resilience in \nindividuals and the wider community (see Healthy \nCities information on page 31). \nWe have also established new ways of working within \nthe business to help accelerate the real-world actions \nand reporting of our decarbonisation transition. We’ve \nestablished new sustainable finance teams at Group and \nwithin our Market Units, with the aim of building our \ncapability to apply a sustainability lens to all business \ndecisions, and who as part of their remit now lead our \nscope 1 and 2 GHG emissions reporting. \nIn 2022, we also calculated our draft 2020 and 2021 \nscope 3 value chain GHG emissions in line with the GHG \nProtocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting \nand Reporting Standard. We have also assessed our \nprogress against our investment temperature alignment \nSBT. These numbers are due to be finalised in 2023 \nand we aim to publish on Bupa.com in due course. \nUnderstanding our scope 3 GHG emissions allows us \nto monitor our progress against our SBTs and identify \nour priority action areas. \nWe have launched new working groups, both at a \nMarket Unit and Group level, to bring together core \nfunctions from across the business to share knowledge, \nbest practice and drive action. For example, our Scope \n3 Strategy and Action working group was established \nto address material scope 3 emissions impacts. \nTo demonstrate this commitment and the progress \nthat has been made so far, Bupa has been recognised \nas part of the UN-backed Race to Zero campaign \nmembership, through the Health Care Without Harm \n‘Health Care Climate Challenge Awards’, receiving \nseveral awards in 2022. More details can be found here. \nMost of Bupa’s GHG emissions are generated in our \nvalue chain (scope 3), and especially by our suppliers \nand our healthcare providers. That’s why we have \nfocused on engaging our biggest suppliers and \nhealthcare providers on aligning with our scope 3\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
