In order to ensure our business remains sound and stable while we elevate our corporate value, we maintain risk \nmanagement frameworks and control measures. In this regard, we are approaching climate change as a global issue with the \npotential to impact the stability of financial markets, representing a threat to the environment, society, people’ s lifestyles and \nbusinesses, and we are managing climate-related risks accordingly. \n \n1. Risk management framework for climate-related risks \nAt Mizuho, we improve corporate value by implementing business strategy, financial strategy, and risk management from an \noverall perspective. One part of this is our risk appetite framework (RAF). Our Board of Directors determines fundamental matters \nand specific risk appetites relevant to the RAF in document form as the risk appetite statement (RAS). \n \nWe classify risks into risk categories such as credit risk and market risk and manage these risks appropriately in line w ith their \nparticular nature. Further, we have established a comprehensive  risk management structure to identify and evaluate overall risk \nand to keep risk within limits that are acceptable. \n \nWe recognize transition risk and physical risk arising from climate change within this risk management framework, and we \nidentify risks that are critical to the implementation of our business plans. In this way, we are controlling risk in line with the \nparticular nature of each risk category and in line with our business strategy (Figure 13). \nFigure 13: Risk management framework for climate-related risks \n \nOversightBusiness \nexecution\nBoard of Directors\nRisk Committee\nPresident & Group CEO Executive Management \nCommittee\nRisk Management CommitteeExecutives in charge \n(GCRO and others)\nReport\nComprehensive risk management/ risk appetite framework (RAF)\nManagement of risk categories\nCredit risk Market risk Liquidity risk Operational \nrisk\nRAF\nPortfolio\nTop risk management\nClimate-related risks\nSustainability Promotion \nCommittee\nIncreasing severity of climate change \nimpacts (a designated top risk)\n5. Risk management \n  \nTCFD Report 2022  -49- \n \n \n2. Management of top risks \nWe have in place a “top risk management” system to designate risks with major potential impact on the group. \n \nExecutive management determines our top risks by reviewing risk events which may harm our corporate value in light of our \nparticular vulnerabilities, the external business environment, and other factors (Figure 14). \n \nFor designated top risks, we endeavor to enhance our additional risk control measures, both preventive and corrective. We also \nintegrate the top risks into our risk appetite policy and business plan as a way of strengthening our governance. In addition, the \nRisk Committee and Board of Directors, with the participation of external experts and outside directors, implement multifaceted \nconfirmation of the appropriateness of selection and the status of controls. \n \nRegarding climate-related risks, following COP26 global concerns about climate change have escalated further, and a range of \nstakeholders are expecting and demanding greater action from financial institutions. Under this business environment, we have  \nbeen taking an expansive view towards climate change risks and reaffirming the hazards that constitute the causes of these risks. \nConsequently, we have designated increasing severity of climate change impacts as a top risk that our group must recognize and \naddress. \n \nFigure 14: Process for designating top risks \n \n \n \n  \nCEO message\nOverview/Introduction\nGovernance\nStrategy\nRisk management\nMetrics and targets\nConclusion\nAppendix\nStage III\nTop risks\nStage II \nTop risk candidates\nStage I\nComprehensive potential risks\nExternal environment Internal environment\nA wide range of internal \nand external potential \nrisks that may harm our \ncorporate value\nRisks with a high level of \nprobability and impact, and \naggregate risks with a high \nlevel of similarity/relevance\nRisks with the potential to \nmaterialize within \napproximately five years \nand have a major impact on \nthe Mizuho group\nStep 1\nStep 2\nStep 3\nChanges in politics, the \neconomy, society, and the \nbusiness environment, \nand regulatory trends and \ntechnical innovations\nInfrastructure and \ngovernance, affecting  \npeople, goods, money, \netc.\n \n-50- Mizuho Financial Group \n \n3. Risk control in carbon-related sectors \n(1) Overview of risk control framework for carbon-related sectors \nAt Mizuho, we establish exposure control policies and control risk in high-risk areas among sectors recognized as facing transition \nrisk at particularly high levels (carbon-related sectors). \n \nThese high-risk areas are identified by evaluating risk along two axes: (1) our clients ’ sectors, and (2) our clients ’ measures to \naddress transition risk. Our risk evaluation determines (1) the client’s sector based on the largest component in the sales/energy \nmix of their business activities, and (2) the client ’s transition risk response based on their formulation of transition strategies and \ntargets, the level of their targets, the progress on their strategy, and similar factors (Figure 15). \nFigure 15: Risk control framework for carbon-related sectors \n \n1.
