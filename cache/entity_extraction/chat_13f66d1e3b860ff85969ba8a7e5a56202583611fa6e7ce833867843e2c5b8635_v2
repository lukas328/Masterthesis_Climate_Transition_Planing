The absence of widely available, detailed, accurate, \nverifiable, reliable, consistent and comparable and other high-quality climate and subsector-related information \nmakes it challenging to accurately disclose or estimate metrics used to assess climate-related risks and \nopportunities.\n • The availability of climate, industrial classification, energy use and efficiency data – including information used \nas a proxy for that data (e.g., EPC rating) – depends on a variety of public, private and civic sector sources. \nHistorically, climate data was largely environmental and weather data was produced by government agencies. \nHowever, the challenge is finding the relevant sources if they exist, and then validating, cleaning, and \nstandardising the data in an accessible form or format.\nClimate metrics and data, the models, scenarios used to create them and the measurement technologies, \nanalytical methodologies and services that support them remain in an incipient stage. Accordingly, the quality \nand interoperability of these models, technologies and methodologies, is also at a relative early stage. Significant \ngaps in sectors, subsectors and across asset classes are impeding not only climate risk management, but also \nthe development of mitigation and adaptation strategies, as well as aspects of operations and credit risk and \ninvestment analysis that depend on data-informed processes. \n2) Risks inherent in the lack of standardisation, transparency and comparability\n • Many voluntary disclosure frameworks and methodologies for calculating climate metrics are new and evolving, \nleading to multiple metrics estimates that are not directly comparable.\n • These differences are compounded by a lack of international coordination on data and methodology standards.\nExisting estimation methods present significant challenges and the development of a more market accepted consistent \nway of measuring and reporting Scope 3 emissions across sectors where they are material and relevant is needed.\nWhere methodologies are publicly described, differences across data providers can still make resulting disclosures \ndifficult to compare for investors and others evaluating climate exposure across their holdings.\n3) Risks inherent in the reliance on assumptions, scenarios and future uncertainty\n • Climate metrics are complex and require many methodological choices, judgements and assumptions.\n • Temperature scenarios and climate metrics and data generally include a set of assumptions that incorporate \nexisting or planned global or regional policies, a business-as-usual sociodemographic projection, and projections \nfor technological progress (including negative emissions and sequestration technologies), none of which may \nhappen as contemplated, and, therefore, the scenarios, climate metrics and data based on those assumptions, \nmay be incorrect.\n • Some assumptions attempt to compensate for existing data gaps, such as past emission trends or comparable \nand reliable company specific targets.\n • Other assumptions rely on given climate scenarios and transition pathway models, the details of which can vary \nwidely despite representing similar outcomes.\n • Uncertainty around future climate-related policy in particular can contribute to greater variation in transition \npathway models. \n • Until other challenges are addressed, there may be a large resource burden associated with calculating and \ndisclosing forward-looking metrics, which often require the assistance of one or more external data and \nmethodology providers. \nCautions about climate-related metrics, \ndata and methodology challenges\n5.7\n91NatWest Group plc | 2022 Climate-related Disclosures Report\nGovernance Strategy and Climate transition plan Risk Management and Scenario Analysis Metrics and TargetsIntroduction\nCautions about climate-related metrics, data and methodology challenges continued\n • In addition, design issues specific to financed emissions raise challenges, particularly around allocating emissions \nto the wide range of financial activities. Financed emissions from owning 1 percent of a company might include \n1 percent of that company’s emissions; a portfolio can rapidly double count if aggregate financed emissions \ninclude each underlying company’s own Scope 3 upstream and downstream emissions. The calculation \nbecomes significantly more complex with other activities, such as when a financial institution serves as a \ncounterparty or is one of multiple underwriters of a financing. \n • The preparation of this report requires the application of a number of key judgements and also requires \nassumptions and estimates to be made. The key areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, \nor where assumptions and estimates are significant to this report, include financed emissions, facilitated \nemissions and portfolio alignment and measurement of climate-related risk and operational emissions. There is a \nrisk that the judgement exercised, or the estimates or assumptions used, may subsequently turn out to be \nincorrect. These judgements and resulting data presented in this report are not a substitute for judgements \nand analysis made independently by the reader. \n4) Risk inherent in methodologies for estimating and calculating GHG emissions.\n • The methodologies for estimating and calculating GHG emissions, financed emissions, whether absolute \nemissions or emissions intensities and other climate-related metrics (such as estimating facilitated emissions) are \nby comparison to financial metrics in their early stage of adoption and application and may vary widely in their \napproaches.\n • Some methodologies use company-specific historical emissions data while others result in estimation of \nemissions based on sectoral or geographical data or averages. Of those that incorporate emissions targets, \nthere are different criteria for the types of targets that can and cannot be used. \n • Methodologies vary in their use of Scope 1, Scope 2, and/or Scope 3 GHG emissions. Some use only Scope 1 \ndata, while others use Scope 1 and 2, and yet others take Scope 1, 2, and 3 GHG emissions into account. \n • Certain methodologies take cumulative historical\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
