\nnet-positive biodiversity impact�\nBiodiversity – the rich diversity of life on Earth – is being lost at an \nalarming rate � The population sizes of mammals, birds, amphibians, \nand reptiles have seen an average drop of nearly 70 percent since \n1970� And more than half of all species face high extinction risk \nunder a business-as-usual climate scenario � \nBiodiversity loss endangers human health and food production, and \nerodes the significant value of our natural resources � It is therefore \nclear that protecting biodiversity is a necessary strategic invest -\nment to preserve not only the planet’s species, but our health, \nwealth, and security � \nRenewable energy, principally wind and solar PV, plays an important \nrole in mitigating climate change and ultimately in stemming global \nbiodiversity loss � But as we accelerate the transition to a world \npowered by renewable energy, we must do so in balance with local \necosystems and species � By carefully considering biodiversity in the \nlifecycle of our projects, we can minimise, or even make positive, our \nimpact on local fauna and flora � \nFailing to take biodiversity into consideration can lead to costly \ncurtailment of our customers’ energy generating capabilities � And in \nthe most severe cases, it can threaten to close entire wind farms �\nBiodiversity has not been a material focus of our sustainability \nstrategy to-date � However, several scientific and framework \ndevelopments such as SBTN (Science Based Targets for Nature)  \nand TNFD (Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures)  \nwill enable us to incorporate biodiversity into our sustainability \nefforts systemically � In 2023, we plan to start this work by conduct -\ning a full biodiversity impact assessment of our operations and \nsupply chain and creating a designated biodiversity policy  \nand monitoring program �\nSiting \nOur greatest opportunity to positively impact biodiversity lies in the \nspatial planning of wind energy development zones � Through wind \nresource and biodiversity impact assessments, we can optimise \nlocations within established wind zones � This ensures new wind \nfarms do not contribute to habitat loss or endanger threatened \nspecies� Working with local agencies and regulations, we carry out \nenvironmental impact assessments when developing new projects � \nWe also take appropriate measures to mitigate or compensate for \nany anticipated adverse impacts our projects might have � \n32\nVestas Sustainability Report 2022\nEnvironmentIn brief General Governance Sustainability dataSocial Appendix\nReefs\nOffshore wind turbines can \nhelp protect marine areas and \nthe foundations can create \nartificial reefs, helping restore an \necosystem heavily damaged by \noverfishing and bottom trawling\nBirds and bats\nWhile decarbonisation is essen-\ntial to protect global avifauna \nbiodiversity, we work to further \nminimise our impact on local bird \npopulations with technology�\nSiting\nBy siting new wind farms with \nbiodiversity in consideration, \nwe can minimise our impact on \nlocal ecosystems�\nImpact assessment \nWhen establishing a wind plant, the planning process should always \ninclude a location impact assessment� In many countries, environmen-\ntal impact assessments are required by law; they can also be required \nby the financial institutions that support infrastructure projects � In \nmost cases, our customers have the primary responsibility for \nundertaking environmental assessments and developing environ -\nmental management systems for their wind plants � However, we are \nresponsible for these steps in the projects we develop ourselves � In \neither case, we work closely with our customers at every stage � \nEnvironmental assessments typically take into account direct and \nindirect impacts, including: \n•  Landscape and visual impressions \n•  Flora (e�g� native vegetation) \n•  Fauna (e�g� birds, mammals, fish) \n•  Noise \n•  Shadows\nImpact on birds and bats \nMost biodiversity impacts relating to wind development are \nshort-term and linked to construction � However, some longer-term \nimpacts, such as the direct collision of birds and bats with turbine \nblades, can also occur � Through careful siting outside major \nmigration corridors and other sensitive areas, the risk to birds and \nbats can be greatly reduced � \nRemaining impacts to local bird species can be further reduced \nthrough the operational curtailment of our wind farms � Indeed, our \nturbines can be optimised to curtail operations based on the \nhistorical peaks of local bird and bat activity, and can incorporate \nradar based systems to track birds and bats even more effectively �\nArtificial reefs\nOffshore wind farms have the potential to help support marine \nwildlife� Wind turbine foundations and scour protection areas can \ncreate new habitats for marine species to colonise � In turn, these \nhabitats attract additional species in a process known as the \n‘artificial reef effect’, leading to more productive and species-rich \necosystems � \nMarine protection \nAccording to the UN’s Global Framework for Managing Nature \nThrough 2030, more than 30 percent of marine areas need to be \nprotected by the end of the decade to ensure marine health is \nmaintained and restored for the future � By conducting environmen -\ntal impact assessments for offshore wind farms, we can contribute \nto the scientific knowledge base that supports marine protection � \nWe can also help establish areas with reduced marine traffic, where \nthe most environmentally damaging activities, such as bottom \ntrawling, are prohibited � \n33\nVestas Sustainability Report 2022\nEnvironmentIn brief
