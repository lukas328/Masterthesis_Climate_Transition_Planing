The suggestions aim to be \ncomplementary to any requirements in line with \nregulatory disclosures or chosen disclosure \nplatforms, but it is not an exhaustive list. \nIf disclosing a transition plan within the framework \nof the TCFD, Foundations, Implementation Strategy, \nand Engagement Strategy themes may fit with the \nTCFD Strategy disclosure because they discuss how \na financial institution may approach its strategy to \nalign with the net-zero transition. Further, the Metrics \nand Targets theme aligns with the TCFD Metrics and \nTargets disclosure recommendations.
