In 2022, Itaú distinguished itself, in \nboth the local and foreign markets.  We are at the top of \nthe ranking of participation in emissions in both markets, \ncase study: engagement of investees – mining \nsector \nIn 2019, Itaú Asset started an ESG engagement \nprocess leading a group of more than 100 investors \nwith a company from the mining sector, with a focus \non risk management, ESG and climate opportunities \nand sustainable performance.  In total, there were \nmore than 10 talks and interactions over the course \nof three years to address topics such as health and \nsecurity, relations with communities, environmental, \nsocial and climate impacts, ESG practices. This \nprocess is still in progress and the company \nhas been presenting changes in its practices, \ncommitments to improve its internal processes and \ngreater transparency in reporting to investors and \nthe community.\nshowing the preference of companies to have us as their \nadvisors in financial operations related to the ESG topics.  \nItaú Private Bank has also been carrying out many actions to \nengage high-income clients. In 2022, we carried out events \nto disseminate knowledge regarding the ESG and climate \ntopic, such as debates between consulting firms and clients \nat Family Wealth Across Generation (FWAG), an event that \nis carried out with our clients who are in the position of \n“successors”. We expanded our communication channel with \nclients through the forwarding of communications on ESG \nand climate products, offering to our clients from the Private \nsegment funds in Brazil and offshore products available \non our shelf and we provided a digital guide to demystify \nconcepts on the topic in investments. \nIn 2022, we carried out events focused on the challenges of \ndecarbonization of relevant industries, such as Agriculture, \nOil and Gas and Energy at Cubo ESG, as described below.\n26 \nItaú Unibanco Holding S.A.climate report 2022\nClient assessment tool\nWe designated a multidisciplinary team for the development \nof a proprietary tool to support the process of assessment \nof the ESG and climate maturity of our clients.

In 2022, during \nCOP27, in partnership with the Brazilian Business Council \nfor Sustainable Development (CEBDS), we participated in \nthe launch of the Brazilian version of a platform aimed \nat understanding the main decarbonization challenges \nof Brazilian companies and at supporting them in the \nincorporation of climate change criteria into their \nstrategies by means of the provision of decarbonization \ntools and guides that are appropriate to the reality of the \nBrazilian economy. \nIdentification of the climate targets of our clients\nIn 2022, we assessed the climate targets of 282 \ncompanies that are Itaú BBA clients, which represented \n28% of the portfolio of this segment and 21% of our \nfinanced emissions at the end of 2021. We identified that the \ncompanies were in different stages of maturity regarding \ndecarbonization.\nThe survey shows the evolution of the topic in the local \nmarket and allowed us to identify priority clients for \nengagement in initiatives such as Cubo ESG and the \nmonitoring of the maturity of clients with respect to the \nclimate change topic.\n26  \nMeasures \nemissions\n256  \n112\nHas a \nreduction \ntarget\n160\nHas a Net Zero \ncommitment\n170\n122Yes\nNo\nClimate targets of Itaú BBA clients\n27 \nItaú Unibanco Holding S.A.climate report 2022\nSupport for innovation and decarbonization by \nmeans of Cubo ESG \nRecognizing that the innovation agenda is essential for our \ndecarbonization and the decarbonization of our clients, \nwe launched in 2022 Cubo ESG, a platform aimed at \nentrepreneurs who wish to transform the environmental \nand social reality of Brazil and Latin America.
