Our full ESG reporting suite \ncan be found here: www.prudentialplc.com/en/esg. \nOur Climate Transition Plan covers material aspects of our \nbusiness and value chain, including our investments and operations, \nthe former of which makes up over 99 per cent of our total carbon \nemissions footprint as currently measured.  \nMore information on the assumptions and methodologies utilised \nthroughout can be found at the end of this document.\nFigure 1: How this Climate Transition Plan fits into our wider ESG reporting suite\nESG Report, Annual Report\nResponsible Investment and ESG policies\nTCFD disclosure \nOverview of climate risk and \nopportunity indentification, \nmanagement, strategy, \nmetrics and targets.\nLooking back:  \nReview of activities \nundertaken during 2022.\nCommon elements \nBoard and \nmanagement oversight\nTargets\nMetrics\nESG strategy implentation\nClimate transition plan \nDetail on how we are meeting \nour climate ambitions, \nincluding addressing the risks \nand opportunities identified in \nTCFD disclosure\nLooking forward:  \nHow we will continue to meet \nour decarbonisation goals\nPrudential plc \nEnvironmental, Social and \nGovernance Report 2022\nCreating a \nbetter future, \ntogether  \nwith you\n 3\nPrudential plc Climate Transition Plan  \n  The importance of a just and inclusive transition  \nThe International Labour Organization defines the just and \ninclusive transition as ‘greening the economy in a way that is as \nfair and inclusive as possible to everyone concerned, creating \ndecent work opportunities and leaving no one behind’. \nPrudential’s view on ‘leaving no one behind when we green \nthe economy’ is that a just and inclusive transition is relevant \non two levels:\n> All countries need to transition, and countries should not be left \nbehind in this global transition, especially the most vulnerable \nones; and\n> Within countries, workers’ rights and livelihoods should be \nsecured during the transition, for example securing jobs for \ncoal workers in coal-dependent regions.\nWe strong believe that a just and inclusive transition is necessary \nfor emerging markets. They are typically most vulnerable to \nthe physical impacts of climate change, despite historically \ncontributing less to the cumulative carbon emissions present \nin our atmosphere today. \nAdditionally, although more dependent on fossil fuels for ongoing \ndevelopment, emerging markets have fewer resources to fund the \ntransition to a low-carbon economy and manage the physical \nimpact of climate change. This is further compounded by having \nthe greatest unfinanced basic development needs, as reflected by \nthe Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). \nWith Prudential’s operations and investments focused on markets \nin emerging economies across Asia and Africa, we are continuously \nmindful of the need to implement our decarbonisation strategy in \na just and inclusive manner, promoting sustainable development \nfor all stakeholders. \nMore information can be found in our white paper, https\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
