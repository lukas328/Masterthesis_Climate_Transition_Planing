Reporting entity's share excludes subordinated debt recorded under equity for Niva Bupa as the Group has no rights over the debt. \n(ii) Individually immaterial equity-accounted investments \nIn addition to the interests in associates disclosed above, the Group also has interests in a number of individually \nimmaterial associates and joint ventures that are accounted for using the equity method. The aggregate carrying \namount of these associates and joint ventures is £13m (2021: £16m). The Group’s share of results recognised during \nthe year for these is a loss of £(3)m (2021: profit of £3m). \nNote 7: \nPost-\nemployment \nbenefits \nPost-employment benefits in brief \nThe Group operates several funded defined benefit and defined \ncontribution pension schemes for the benefit of employees and Directors, \nin addition to an unfunded scheme and a post-retirement medical benefit \nscheme. \nThe main defined benefit scheme is The Bupa Pension Scheme which has been closed to new entrants since 1 \nOctober 2002 and closed to future accrual since 31 December 2020. \nDefined contribution pension schemes \nThe defined contribution pension schemes provide employees with a retirement fund accumulated through \ninvestment of contributions made by Bupa and the employees. Members of the scheme use their funds to secure \nbenefits at retirement. Benefits are not known in advance and the investment and longevity risks are assumed \nsolely by the members of the scheme. Contributions payable by the relevant sponsoring employers are defined in \nthe scheme rules or plan specifications and these contributions are recognised as an expense in the Consolidated \nIncome Statement as incurred. \nDefined benefit post-employment schemes \nThe defined benefit pension schemes provide benefits based on final pensionable salary. The Group’s net obligation \nin respect of defined benefit pensions is calculated separately for each scheme and represents the present value \nof the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of scheme assets. The discount rate used is the yield at the \nreporting date on high-quality corporate bonds denominated in the currency in which the benefit will be paid and \ntaking account of the maturities of the defined benefit obligations. When the calculation results in a benefit to the \nGroup, the recognised asset is limited to the present value of any future refunds from the scheme or reductions in \nfuture contributions to the scheme. \nThe charge to the Consolidated Income Statement for defined benefit schemes represents the net interest cost \nand administrative expenses. \nAll remeasurements are recognised in full in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period \nin which they occur. \nBupa Annual Report 2022 155 \n      \n          \n \n         \n      \n           \n                 \n \n      \n      \n \n          \n          \n          \n          \n          \n      \n   \n                  \n              \n \n   \n                    \n                  \n                 \n                \n                   \n               \n    \n                    \n                     \n                      \n             \n                \n   \n              \n                \n      \n                   \n                  \n                  \n         \n                \n                \n                    \n \n                \n                 \n                      \n            \n                 \n               \n   \n          \n      \n   \nStrategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements \nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \ncontinued \n(i) Amounts recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement \nThe amounts (credited)/charged to other operating expenses for the year are: \nNet interest on defined benefit liability/asset \nAdministrative expenses \nTotal amount credited to the Consolidated Income Statement \n2022 \n£m \n(8) \n2 \n(6) \n2021 \n£m \n(7) \n2 \n(5) \nThe charge to other operating expenses in respect of cash contributions to defined contribution schemes is £58m \n(2021: £52m). \n(ii) Amounts recognised directly in other comprehensive income \nThe amounts charged/(credited) directly to equity are: \n2022 2021 \n£m £m \nActual return less expected return on assets 920 33 \nGain arising from changes to financial assumptions (811) (13\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
