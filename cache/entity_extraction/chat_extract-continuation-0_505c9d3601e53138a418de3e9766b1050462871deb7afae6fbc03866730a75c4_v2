Furthermore, the reduc-\ntion of the learning curve for new sales staff is a significant \nbenefit, since it helps to quickly integrate them into the \nteam and speed up their performance. Tina issues alerts \nprioritizing business opportunities and preventing possible \nshortages.\nThe transformative approach to our processes has been \nhighlighted in our innovation strategy over recent years, \nbeing added to the digital approach in relation to our \nclients and customers. In our digital transformation pro-\ngrams in 2022, we have structured and consolidated four \ncentral fronts: Agro 4.0, Logistics 4.0, Commodities 4.0 and \nIndustry 4.0.\nBelow is a balance sheet of investments and highlights.\nRecognition by IT Mídia, as \none of the most innovative \ncompanies in the use of \ntechnology in 2022\n52\ndigital\n transformation \nprojects implemented \nin 2022\n2022 Integrated  \nReport\nOur way of  \ndoing business\nOur strategy\nCulture and \nEngagement\nValue Generation\nIndicators  \nand annex\n3\n4\n5\n6\n2\nPresentation1\n45\nAgro 4.0\nThe Agro 4.0 digital platform aims to increasingly \nestablish the connection with the integrated producers, \ncreating an ecosystem that meets their needs, facilitates \nlife in the field, creates lines of family succession based \nupon technology, brings longevity to the process and \nincreases both the efficiency and sustainability.\nMore than 9,500 integrated producers, as well as 600 \nextension workers (veterinarians) make use of the Agro \n4.0 platform, a digital product developed in-house which, \nin 2022, was scaled up to global level to allow access by \nintegrated producers and extension workers in Turkey.\nRead more about some of the leading actions:\nNew features in the Next app\nThrough this technological platform, extension workers \ncan manage their routines more efficiently using tools such \nas a logbook and an integrated checklist of their visits to \ndifferent locations, as well as access all the information and \nnotifications on the lots from their integrated producers. \nThe app also allows for registration of technical advice and \nthe monitoring of results.\nAgroBRF – Producers’ Platform\nThis platform consists of an ecosystem that is connected \nto all of the company’s satellite systems, providing the \nproducer with an extensive amount of information on their \nlots, this being very important in the daily routine. This new \nmodel of working based upon data collected online (which \nare updated daily and processed using artificial intelligence \nand machine learning tools) will help the Company to evolve \nin terms of production and efficiency in the Agricultural \nchain. The platform also involves communication features, \nfleet tracking and a dashboard of indicators on the poultry, \nturkey and pig chains.\nGrain monitoring\nAdvances in the installation of sensors \non farms with data collected using IoT, \nallowing the installations to be monitored \nin real time, and providing better support \nfor decision-making.\nResearch performed together with \nother areas \nconnected to production, such as those focused \non the genetic improvement of herds (biological \nassets) and feed conversion (or in other words, \nthe relationship between feed consumed and \nweight gain).\n•  Implementation of innovative respiratory \nmonitoring technology by a partner producer \nin Lajeado (RS), currently in the performance \nevaluation stage.\n•  Implementation of weighing by image and \ngrowth curve by a termination/finishing partner \nin Concórdia (SC), also in the evaluation stage.\n•  Expansion of the biological starter culture \nproduction project, together with 30 partners, \nwhich allows for the biodegradability of organic \nmaterial present in waste.\n2022 Integrated  \nReport\nOur way of  \ndoing business\nOur strategy\nCulture and \nEngagement\nValue Generation\nIndicators  \nand annex\n3\n4\n5\n6\n2\nPresentation1\n46\nCommodities 4.0\nThe Commodities 4.0 Journey combines territorial intel-\nligence technology solutions and advanced analytics to \ndigitalize the Company’s entire grains acquisition process, \nensuring greater transparency, assertiveness and agility \nin the procurement processes by connecting the pro-\nducers with BRF. As one of the branches of the journey, \nit integrates our efforts to move forward on our public \ncommitment to guaranteeing the traceability of 100% of \nthe grains we buy from the Amazon and Cerrado regions \nby 2025. This commitment is directly linked to one of the \nfronts of the 2040 Net Zero Plan.\nThe project also optimizes BRF’s logistics positioning, \nplanning a better combination between the current and \nfuture logistics positions to ensure a streamlined supply \nto the production units. This activity is performed using \nsatellite monitoring of 7 million hectares of farmland in \n7 Brazilian states and, with the help of a mathematical \nalgorithm and a data repository (including market data), it \nallows BRF to identify the best moment to purchase corn \n- thereby creating insights into the future price of grain \nwith a 24 month perspective, and allowing us to plan and/\nor use grain stocks depending upon market fluctuations. \nAnother benefit of the platform is that it provides a full \nand comprehensive vision of the transportation chain, \nfrom the negotiation of the freight through to the delivery \nof the grains to the factories.
