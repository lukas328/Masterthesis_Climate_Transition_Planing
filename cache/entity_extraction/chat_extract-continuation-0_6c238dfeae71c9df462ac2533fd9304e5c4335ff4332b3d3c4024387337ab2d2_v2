Chief Executive Officer pay ratio revised to include employee bonuses payable in relation to 2021/22. This changed upper quartile from \n36:1 to 20:1, median from 34:1 to 28:1 and lower quartile from 41:1 to 35:1\n2. The Chief Executive Officer single figure for 2021/22 is in respect of both Robert MacLeod and Liam Condon, who both held the position \nof Chief Executive Officer in the year. The single total figure of £1,672,000 comprises £1,557,000 for Robert MacLeod and £115,000 \nfor Liam Condon\nBonus data for UK employees was left out of the 2023 calculation because it was not \nadministratively possible to calculate these bonuses before the publication of this report. \nHowever, the calculation will be revised to include these bonuses once available and will \nbe disclosed in the 2024 report. Excluding the 2022/23 bonus payable to the Chief Executive \nOfficer from the calculation would result in the following pay ratios: lower quartile – 29:1, \nmedian – 23:1 and upper quartile – 18:1.\nThe salary and total pay for the individuals identified at the lower quartile, median and upper \nquartile positions in 2023 are set out below:\n2023 Salary1 Total pay\nUpper quartile individual £59,278 £72,086\nMedian individual £47,149 £54,458\nLower quartile individual £38,401 £44,108\n1. Includes shift allowance\nOur principles for pay setting and progression are consistent across the organisation. \nUnderpinning our principles is a need to provide a competitive total reward to enable the \nattraction and retention of high-calibre individuals and giving the opportunity for individual \ndevelopment and career progression. The pay ratios reflect the difference in role \naccountabilities that are recognised through our pay structures and the greater variable pay \nopportunity for more senior positions. The Chief Executive Officer’s variable pay opportunity \nis higher than those employees noted in the table reflecting the weighting towards long-term \nvalue creation and alignment with shareholder interests inherent in this role.\nThe movement in our Chief Executive Officer to employee pay ratio between 2020-2023 \nis driven by the different bonus outcomes and fixed income for the Chief Executive Officer \nin each of these years. There have been no other changes to remuneration arrangements \nfor our UK employees that would affect the CEO pay ratio.\nWe are satisfied that the median pay ratio is consistent with our wider pay, reward and \nprogression policies for employees. All our employees have the opportunity for annual pay \nincreases, career progression and development opportunities.\nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 2023126\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTSOTHER INFORMATION\nAnnual report on remuneration continued\nImplementing the Directors’ Remuneration Policy for 2023/24\nThe table below sets out how the Remuneration Committee intends to apply the Directors’ Remuneration Policy for the year ended 31st March 2024.\nSalary The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer both received a pay increase of 3.5%. This is below the increase awarded to other UK employees.\nBenefits No change to policy applied in 2023/24.\nPension All executive directors will have a maximum pension cash supplement of 15%.\nAnnual incentives The maximum bonus opportunity for 2023/24 remains unchanged at 180% of salary for the Chief Executive Officer and 150% of salary for the Chief Financial Officer.\n2023/24 bonus will be based on underlying profit before tax (50%), working capital (20%) and strategic and transformation objectives (30%). Targets for the Chief Executive Officer \nand Chief Financial Officer will be based on group performance. \nThe 2023/24 targets are considered similarly challenging, if not more challenging to those set in 2022/23, when accounting for the divestments in the year and uncertain economic \noutlook. The recalibration of targets has been set taking this into account as well as internal and external planning. To the extent that metal prices move outside a defined corridor the \nRemuneration Committee will rebase the targets such that they are similarly challenging as when the targets were originally set. The Remuneration Committee considers the forward-\nlooking targets to be commercially sensitive but full retrospective disclosure of the actual targets will be included in next year’s Directors’ Remuneration report.\n50% of any bonus paid will be deferred in shares for three years, and the payment of any bonus is subject to appropriate malus and clawback provisions.\nLong-term incentives The Chief Executive Officer award level is 250% of base salary and the Chief Financial Officer award level is 175% of base salary. These award levels are in line with our remuneration policy.\nThe long-term Performance Share Plan will be based on EPS growth targets (30% of the award), relative TSR performance (40% of the award) and specific and measurable strategic \nobjectives (30% of award). \nThe range of annualised EPS growth targets that the committee intends to set for the 2023/24 awards is 1% per annum growth for\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>JOHNSON MATTHEY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Johnson Matthey is a global specialty chemicals and sustainable technologies company, providing innovative solutions in catalysis, precious metals, and environmental technologies, as detailed in their annual report.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROBERT MACLEOD<|>PERSON<|>Robert MacLeod is a senior executive at Johnson Matthey who held the position of Chief Executive Officer in 2021/22 and 2022/23, involved in setting strategic direction and remuneration policies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIAM CONDON<|>PERSON<|>Liam Condon is a senior executive at Johnson Matthey who served as Chief Executive Officer in 2021/22, sharing responsibilities with Robert MacLeod during that period.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNITED KINGDOM<|>GEO<|>The United Kingdom is the country where Johnson Matthey's UK employees work and where the company reports its pay ratios and remuneration policies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>2021/22<|>EVENT<|>The fiscal year 2021/22, during which Johnson Matthey reported on pay ratios, benefits, and executive remuneration.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>2022/23<|>EVENT<|>The fiscal year 2022/23, during which Johnson Matthey reported total pay, benefits, and pay ratios for employees and executives.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>2023/24<|>EVENT<|>The upcoming fiscal year for which Johnson Matthey is planning remuneration policies, including salary increases, incentives, and long-term incentive awards.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOHNSON MATTHEY<|>ROBERT MACLEOD<|>Robert MacLeod is the Chief Executive Officer of Johnson Matthey<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOHNSON MATTHEY<|>LIAM CONDON<|>Liam Condon is the Chief Executive Officer of Johnson Matthey<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOHNSON MATTHEY<|>UNITED KINGDOM<|>Johnson Matthey operates in the UK and reports on UK employee pay ratios<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>2021/22<|>JOHNSON MATTHEY<|>The year Johnson Matthey reported on pay ratios and executive remuneration<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>2022/23<|>JOHNSON MATTHEY<|>The year Johnson Matthey reported total pay, benefits, and pay ratios<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>2023/24<|>JOHNSON MATTHEY<|>The upcoming year for which Johnson Matthey is planning remuneration policies<|>7)\n##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
