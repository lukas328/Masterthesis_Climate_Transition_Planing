The Committee comprises senior leaders from \nthe business, including our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”). It reports to the Chief Executive \nOfficer, who reports into the DLC Sustainability, Social and Ethics (“SS&E”) Committee. \nOn page 34, we describe the formation of an in-house Governance Group, with members \nfrom across our regional Investments, Sustainability and Operations teams, with the aim of \nensuring our governance processes support effective stewardship across the business. \nOur quarterly Sustainability Committee meetings, which are attended by key stewardship \nstakeholders, holistically considers sustainability throughout three pillars; Invest, \nAdvocate, Inhabit. The Committee has been effective in driving a cohesive response to \nNinety One’s sustainability priorities, placing sustainability at the core of the business. On \npage 25, we describe the launch of Transition School, part of our ongoing commitment \nto training aimed at helping our investment teams allocate, manage and oversee capital \nresponsibly to create long-term value for clients and beneficiaries. On pages 17 and 18, \nas an example of some of the outcomes of this training, we provide an overview of how \neach of our investment teams implements ESG within its investment process, as well as an \nupdate on current initiatives regarding ESG integration. We provide diversity statistics, with \ndisclosures by gender and ethnicity, as well as details on our approach to diversity, equity \nand inclusion in the Inhabit section of this report.\n85\nSustainability and Stewardship Report\nPrinciple Ninety One’s activities \n2. Signatories’ \ngovernance, resources \nand incentives support \nstewardship (continued). \nHuman resources\nNinety One’s investment teams are fully responsible for addressing and embedding ESG \nand active ownership considerations. This was a strategic decision in order to achieve \ncredible integration. They are monitored and supported by other functions including a \nSustainability team and an Investment Risk function. Our investment teams are supported \nby specialist teams: \n ɽ The sustainability team oversees and supports Ninety One’s sustainability strategy \nand implementation; aligns teams on strategic engagements; and provides specialist \nknowledge and guidance on issues like transition-plan assessments, just transition, \ngovernance frameworks, engagement approaches and voting.\n ɽ Within the investment risk team, an ESG Risk function monitors firm- and portfolio-\nlevel sustainability risks and manages ESG data. \n ɽ IT specialists integrate and surface ESG data through our digital platform for the \ninvestment teams.\n ɽ An operations team administers proxy voting.\nOur experienced Sustainability team consists of five members: our Chief Sustainability \nOfficer, Sustainability Director and three sustainability analysts, with average industry \nexperience of 17 years.\nData resources\nPlease refer to page 17, which explains how we have invested in developing our data \nsources and tools to aid research and analysis over the reporting period, and principle 8 \nwhich explains how we have used service and data providers.\nPerformance review and remuneration \nSustainability is integrated into our performance-review and remuneration processes. \nVariable remuneration for Executive Directors incorporates both financial and non-\nfinancial performance targets that reflect the key financial and strategic priorities of Ninety \nOne, including our commitment to sustainability. Please refer to the Ninety One Integrated \nAnnual Report for further details on our remuneration structure. \n3. Signatories manage \nconflicts of interest to \nput the best interests of \nclients and beneficiaries \nfirst.\nOur Conflicts of Interest Policy can be found in our ‘Stewardship policy and proxy \nvoting guidelines’.\nOur approach to conflicts of interest \nNinety One acts as a fiduciary to its clients. As such, it will always seek to manage any \nconflicts that may occur through its normal business activities so that there is no material \nrisk of damage to clients.\nNinety One has a firmwide Conflicts of Interest Policy, as well as a separate Conflicts of \nInterest Committee which manages the broader remit of potential conflicts across the \nbusiness. Examples of potential conflicts include: \n ɽ Proxy voting: Ninety One has established processes to manage potential conflict-\nof-interest issues through the voting process. These conflicts can vary in nature \nand Ninety One will respond to each case individually, following a strict process. An \nexample would be instances of Ninety One board members or senior employees \nserving on the boards of other publicly listed companies. To manage this, the \ncompliance team has put in place internal controls, including a Ninety One policy, in \nrespect of outside business activities. Where a conflict is detected, the issue is dealt \nwith appropriately and escalated to the Ninety One Sustainability Committee, where \nnecessary. We would also cast a ‘do not vote’ decision on holdings in listed Ninety \nOne-managed funds and Ninety One plc/Ltd.\n86\nSustainability and Stewardship Report\nPrinciple Ninety One’s activities \n3.

To mitigate any potential conflict of interest, \nproxy voting has been closely monitored to ensure that complete independence \nwas achieved. After the Naspers 2017 AGM, Ninety One decided that the \npotential conflict of interest was best managed by referring all Naspers and \nProsus voting-related matters directly to clients. We have followed this process \nsince then.
