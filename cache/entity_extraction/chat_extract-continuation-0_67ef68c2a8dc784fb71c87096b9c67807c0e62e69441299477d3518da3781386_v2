Operations \n \nFor our own operations we are already committed to net-zero GHG emissions by 2030. The main \noperations in scope are Travel and Fleet, Procurement, Facility Management, and IT.  \n \nTo this end, we target to reduce GHG emissions arising from Allianz sites and operational activities in over \n70 markets to net-zero by 2030, earlier than 2050 as originally planned. We have accelerated our climate \ntargets for our own operations and by 2025 plan to reduce GHG emissions per employee by 50% versus a \n2019 baseline across Scope 1, Scope 2, and relevant Scope 3 emissions (currently energy-related emissions, \nbusiness travel, and paper use). For year-end 2030, we target GHG emission reductions of 70% and for \nyear-end 2029, -65%.23 \n \nKey drivers will be sourcing 100% renewable electricity by 2023, implementing energy efficiency and \nreduction measures in heating and cooling, shifting to a fully electric corporate car fleet by 2030 at the \nlatest, covered by a commitment to EV100 with the Climate Group, and achieving a 40% reduction of GHG \nemissions from travel activities by 2025 against a 2019 baseline. To address the remaining 30% of the \nemissions, we will use high-quality carbon removal solutions.  \n \nBeyond our own operations, we will ask 100% of global framework vendors in our supply chain that \nprovide services globally to establish a public commitment to net-zero GHG emissions in line with the 1.5°C \npath by 2025. \nD Call to action to governments \nHowever, further action is needed from national governments in order to close the still wide ambition gap, \nincluding setting nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and country pathways in line with 1.5°C. \nFor the long-term success of our global economy and society, the actions of businesses and financial \ninstitutions that have set 1.5°C-aligning net-zero commitments need to be matched by governments and \nregulators. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n23 Target year 2030 is always defined as using year-end 2029 values for investment and P&C targets. For own operations and for \nreporting purposes, we will be moving our year-end 2030 timeline one year forward to year-end 2029 to align with reporting cut-off \ndates for proprietary investments and P&C insurance. -70% target is based on end 2030. A pro-rata calculation at the end-2029 would \ncorrespond to -65%. The strategy review for own operations is currently ongoing and will be updated accordingly in 2024.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PIMCO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>PIMCO is an investment management firm that produces ESG investing reports and provides insights on sustainable investing practices)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALLIANZGI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>AllianzGI (Allianz Global Investors) is an asset management company that publishes sustainability and stewardship reports, including the 2022 report mentioned)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALLIANZ<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Allianz is a global financial services company involved in insurance, asset management, and banking, committed to sustainability and net-zero GHG emissions by 2030)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRAVEL<|>EVENT<|>Travel is a business activity involving movement of employees, targeted for a 40% reduction in GHG emissions by 2025)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FLEET<|>EVENT<|>Fleet refers to the company's vehicle operations, which are planned to shift to a fully electric fleet by 2030)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROCUREMENT<|>EVENT<|>Procurement involves sourcing goods and services, with a focus on establishing sustainability commitments in the supply chain by 2025)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FACILITY MANAGEMENT<|>EVENT<|>Facility management includes operations of physical sites, targeted for GHG reduction measures)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IT<|>EVENT<|>Information Technology operations, part of the company's scope for emissions reduction efforts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALLIANZ<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Allianz aims to achieve net-zero GHG emissions across its operations by 2030, with specific targets for energy use, transportation, and emissions reduction)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GHG EMISSIONS<|>EVENT<|>Greenhouse gas emissions are targeted for significant reduction, including a 70% reduction by 2030 and a 50% reduction per employee by 2025)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY<|>EVENT<|>Sourcing 100% renewable electricity by 2023 is a key driver for reducing emissions in Allianz's operations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EV100<|>ORGANIZATION<|>EV100 is a global initiative by the Climate Group that supports companies in transitioning to electric vehicle fleets, which Allianz commits to by 2030)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLIMATE GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Climate Group is an international non-profit organization that runs EV100 and promotes climate action among businesses)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOVERNMENTS<|>PERSON<|>National governments are called upon to take further climate action, including setting nationally determined contributions (NDCs) aligned with 1.5°C pathways)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NDCs<|>EVENT<|>Nationally Determined Contributions are climate commitments made by countries to reduce emissions and meet climate goals)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>1.5°C<|>EVENT<|>The 1.5°C target refers to limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, guiding climate policies and commitments)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PIMCO<|>ALLIANZ<|>Both are major financial organizations involved in investment and asset management, with PIMCO providing ESG reports and Allianz focusing on insurance and sustainability<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALLIANZ<|>GOVERNMENTS<|>Allianz calls for government action to support climate goals, including setting NDCs<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALLIANZ<|>EV100<|>Allianz is committed to transitioning its vehicle fleet to electric vehicles through EV100<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLIMATE GROUP<|>EV100<|>Climate Group runs EV100, which Allianz has committed to<|>4)\n##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
