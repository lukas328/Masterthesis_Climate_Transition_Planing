Cost is determined using the first-in first-out \nmethod, or methods that approximate this, and includes costs incurred in acquiring the inventories and in bringing \nthem to their current location and condition. \nAs at 31 December 2022, inventories were £91m (2021: £93m).

Trade receivables relate to \nconsideration due from customer contracts. All trade receivables and service concession receivables are classified \nas receivables under IFRS 15, as a receivable is an entity’s right to consideration that is unconditional, i.e. only the \npassage of time is required before payment is due. Other receivables relate to consideration due from contracts \nthat are outside the scope of IFRS 15, e.g. rental receivables. Information regarding the ageing of trade and other \nreceivables is shown in Note 26.3. \nThe carrying value of trade and other receivables is a reasonable approximation of fair value. \n(a) Impairment of financial assets \nFinancial assets comprise trade and other receivables and financial investments. Refer to Note 9 for financial \ninvestments. \nAll receivables are measured net of lifetime ECL. Where appropriate, a provision matrix is used to estimate ECL. \nUnder a provision matrix, receivables are grouped into customer segments and further divided into categories \nby age. Historical credit loss experience and any relevant forward-looking information is then used to establish \nthe ECL provision for each category. An analysis of ECL provisions for trade and other receivables is disclosed \nin Note 26.3. All impairment losses are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement within net impairment \non financial assets. Impairment losses on trade receivables of £11m have been recognised in the period (2021: £8m). \nBupa Annual Report 2022 168 \n   \n               \n                   \n                    \n                 \n   \n               \n                  \n                  \n                   \n                  \n         \n \n \n   \n      \n           \n         \n            \n     \n \n         \n     \n        \n                \n                 \n                  \n                 \n          \n          \n      \n   \nStrategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements \nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \ncontinued \n(b) Service concession receivables \nThe Group has recognised service concession receivables in respect of a public–private partnership arrangement in \nSpain. A financial asset is recognised to the extent that Bupa has an unconditional contractual right to receive cash \nat the direction of the grantor for both the construction and operational services and the grantor has little, if any, \ndiscretion to avoid payment. This financial asset is carried at amortised cost (using the effective interest method) \nless ECL provision. \nIn respect of operational services provided, revenue is recognised based on the average operating margin for \nthe life of the contract. The operating margin is based on historic performance plus projections and is reassessed \nbased on changes in expected performance, with an adjustment made to the current year results to bring the \ncontract performance to date in line with the revised margin. As revenue is based on an expected margin, with \nsome potential variability, revenue is only ever recognised to the extent that it is highly probable a significant \nreversal will not occur when the uncertainty is resolved. \nCash and cash equivalents in brief Note 15: \nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances, call deposits and other \nCash and cash short-term highly liquid investments (including money market funds) with \noriginal maturities of three months or less which are subject to an \nequivalents insignificant risk of change in value. \n2022 2021 \n£m £m \nCash at bank\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
