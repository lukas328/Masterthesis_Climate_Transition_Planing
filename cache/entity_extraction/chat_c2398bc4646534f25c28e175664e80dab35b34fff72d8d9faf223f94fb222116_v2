We are concerned about how the \npotentially catastrophic effects of climate change may impact \nour communities and customers across Asia and Africa. \nWe are invested in the sustainable long-term development of \nour markets, and our approach to the just and inclusive transition \nfocuses on making sure that no one, including those within emerging \nmarkets, is left behind in the global transition towards a low carbon \neconomy. As such, we are focused on ensuring the debate on how to \nachieve this common goal is based on steps that are relevant and \nappropriate for these specific societies, given that they are not largely \nresponsible for the current level of global environmental damage.\nThe financial industry can play an accelerating or hampering role \nin the energy transition. Long-term investors like Prudential will be \ncrucial for the energy transition as they have to take a long-term \nview due to the nature of the business and long-term liabilities. \nEven with this long-term view, however, looking more than 25 years \nahead is challenging, as there remain many unknowns on a global \nscale. Importantly, the financial industry is dependent on other \nactors in society, most notably governments, to create the enabling \nenvironment needed for the energy transition. \nThis is the first iteration of our Climate Transition Plan. It sets out our \nlong-term net zero pledge and interim targets, and the progress we \nhave made against them. It describes the actions we plan to take to \nimplement our decarbonisation strategy across our investment \nportfolio1 and operations, as well as highlighting the areas in which \nwe need to strengthen our understanding and approach. We are \nseeking to utilise this first iteration of our externally disclosed Climate \nTransition Plan as an engagement mechanism with our investors and \nstakeholders, to seek feedback as we continue in the current target \ncycle and begin to think about the next iteration of climate-related \ntargets. We will therefore consider providing our shareholders with an \nadvisory vote on our climate action and updated transition planning \nin the future.  \nWe acknowledge the current and future uncertainties that we and \nothers face in our decarbonisation journey, and that the long-term \nprojections within this plan are more uncertain than the short-term \nones. Our plan reflects a measured and deliberate approach which \nis expected to evolve over time. In particular, we expect our climate \nand decarbonisation strategy to continue to evolve as we gain \nmore accurate and in-depth data, deeper insights into the specific \nchallenges and evolutions of our local markets, and knowledge from \nour engagement and advocacy efforts across our value chain. We \nalso expect our Climate Transition Plan to adapt to reflect market, \nregulatory, technological and other climate-related developments \naffecting the context and pace of the global transition towards net \nzero. Therefore, we aim to update this document periodically to \nensure we maintain transparency and accountability of our climate \nambition and strategy.\nWe look forward to further engagement with our stakeholders on the \ntransition towards a net zero economy, and welcome feedback and \ncollaboration as we continue to evolve our approach. \nFoundations \n1 Our investment portfolio (’investment portfolio’) includes both listed equities and corporate bonds in all shareholder and policyholder assets, while excluding assets held by joint venture \nbusinesses and assets in unit-linked funds as we do not have full authority to change the investment strategies of these.
