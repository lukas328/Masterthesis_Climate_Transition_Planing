dataSocial Appendix\nAs the newly discovered process only uses widely \navailable chemicals, industrialisation can occur \nquickly and cost-efficiently � Once this new technol -\nogy is implemented at scale, legacy blade material \ncurrently sitting in landfill, as well as blade material \nin active windfarms, can be disassembled, and \nre-used � \nA pilot project to operationalise the partnership \nand construct new recycling facilities will now com -\nmence� Based on the success of this pilot, the part -\nners will begin to scale up the circular blade recy -\ncling solutions, signaling the beginning of a circular \neconomy for all existing and future epoxy-based \nturbine blades, and a new era for circularity in the \nwind industry �\nOnce mature, the new solution will provide Vestas \nwith the opportunity to produce new turbine \nblades made from re-used blade material � In the \nfuture, the new solution may also enable all epoxy-\nbased composite material to become a source of \nraw material in the broader circular economy, poten-\ntially encompassing industries beyond wind energy�\nThis is the ultimate goal of circular economy, the \nfirst step in which has been unlocked by this break-\nthrough in technology, and proving our philosophy \nthat scaling-up sustainably requires innovative col -\nlaboration with strategic partners � \n \nThe newly discovered chemical
