The Group as a whole is not \nrated by any rating agency. Individual debt issues and certain subsidiaries within the Group have public ratings. \nAt least annually, the Group carries out an Economic Capital Assessment (ECA) in which it makes its own \nquantification of how much capital is required to support its risks. The ECA is used to assess how well the Standard \nFormula SCR reflects the Group’s actual risk profile. \nThe ECA forms part of the Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) which comprises all the activities by which \nthe Group establishes the level of capital required to meet its solvency needs over the planning period given the \nGroup’s strategy and risk appetite. The conclusions from these activities are summarised in the ORSA report which \nis reviewed by the Risk Committee, approved by the Board and submitted to the PRA annually. \nThe Group’s eligible Own Funds include the Group IFRS net assets (£6.9bn) valued on a Solvency II basis, together \nwith eligible subordinated liabilities, subject to adjustments for non-available assets and non-controlling interests. \nAs at 31 December 2022, the Group’s eligible Own Funds, determined in accordance with the Solvency II valuation \nrules, were £4.9bn¹ (2021: £4.5bn), which was in excess of the Group estimated SCR of £2.7bn¹ (2021: £2.5bn). \nThis represented a solvency coverage ratio of 181%¹ (2021: 179%). \n1.

It recommends to the Board a risk appetite that reflects Bupa’s \npurpose and expresses the degree of risk Bupa should accept in delivering \nmanagement on its strategy. \nBupa operates a ‘three lines’ approach to the governance of risk management: \n1. Business management and employees are responsible for the identification and assessment of risks and \ncontrols. \n2. Risk, Compliance and Clinical Governance functions provide support and challenge the completeness and \naccuracy of risk assessments and the adequacy of mitigation plans. \n3. Internal Audit provides independent and objective assurance on the robustness of the risk management \nframework, and the appropriateness and effectiveness of internal controls. \nThe operations of the risk management framework and current principal risks of the Group and how they are \nmitigated are described on pages 42-48. \nThe Group has adopted a risk management strategy that endeavours to mitigate these risks, which is approved \nby the Board. In managing these exposures, the Corporate Finance Executive Committee reviews and recommends \nchanges to the management of insurance and investment risks. \nThe Group has exposure to a number of financial risks associated with its insurance business and from its use \nof financial instruments. These have been categorised into the following types of financial risk, and details of the \nnature, extent, and how the Group has managed these risks is described below. \n▪ Insurance risk \n▪ Market risk \n▪ Credit risk \n▪ Liquidity risk \n26.1 Insurance risk \nInsurance risk only affects the insurance entities in the Group. It consists of underwriting risks which relate to the \npotential inadequacy of insurance premiums as well as reserving risk which relates to the potential inadequacy \nof claims provisions. \n(i) Underwriting risk \nUnderwriting risk refers to the potential deviation of claims experience from the actuarial assumptions used for \nsetting insurance premium rates which could lead to premium inadequacy. Underwriting risk is therefore concerned \nwith both the setting of adequate premium rates (pricing risk) and the management of claims (claims risk) for \ninsurance policies underwritten by the Group. \nPricing risk \nPricing risk relates to the setting of adequate premium rates taking into consideration the volume and \ncharacteristics of the insurance policies issued. External influences on pricing risk include (but are not limited \nto) competitors’ pricing and product design initiatives, regulatory environments and claims. The level of influence \nfrom these external factors can vary significantly between regions and largely depends on the maturity of health \ninsurance markets and the role of the regulator. Actuarial analysis performed on a regular basis combined with an \nunderstanding of local market dynamics and the ability to change insurance premium rates when necessary are \neffective risk mitigations. \nThe direct impacts of climate change on health are unclear but these impacts are likely to emerge over time and \nthe short-tailed nature of the Group's products allows for responses to be made to any developments, although \nthis can be limited by pricing controls in some markets. \nIn every general insurer in the Group, the dominant product or policy category is an annually renewable health \ninsurance contract. This permits insurance premium rate revisions to respond quickly to changes in customer risk \nprofiles, claims experience and market considerations. \nThe ability to review premium rates is a significant mitigant to pricing risk.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
