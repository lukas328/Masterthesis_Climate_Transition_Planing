\npresent. Different factors (amongst which, and most espe-\ncially, are the tackling of Covid-19, the war in Ukraine and \nother areas of political instability) have caused inflationary \npressures to spread into almost every country, generally \naffecting many different types of production chain. \nAmongst the increases that most affected BRF‚Äôs opera-\ntions in 2022 were those connected to maritime freight, \ndiesel and products linked to animal feed and industrial \noperations. \nThe impact of these higher costs was felt in the results. \nIn order to minimize its exposure to the risks and contain \nthe impact of the rise in prices, BRF developed actions fo-\ncused on generating more efficiency. These ranged from \nstandardization of maintenance parts to the reduction of \nwaste and re-engineering of packaging.\nIn Brazil, specifically, the domestic market continued to be \naffected by the sustained increase in inflation, which re-\nduced the willingness to spend in the segments of some \nof our customers, above all in products of aggregate \nvalue.  Inflation closed the year with the IPCA at 5.79%, \nabove the target of 3.5% established by the Central Bank. \nDefaulting rose to very high levels, at around 30%, tight-\nening the consumers‚Äô purse strings and leading to chang-\nes in spending patterns and eating habits.\nIn terms of production, the chain remained promising and \nimportant for the global animal protein market, despite \nthe risks of embargoes as a result of epidemics and dis-\neases affecting pigs and poultry. In 2022, pig farming ex-\nperienced its third consecutive record year in Brazil, with \n4.9 tons being produced. In relation to chicken in 2022, \nexports reached 4.8 million tons. This data is provided by \nthe Brazilian Animal Protein Association (ABPA), which has \npublished positive forecasts for global demand and the \ncountry‚Äôs export capacity for 2023.\nIn relation to the region of the Middle East, Turkey and \nNorth Africa, where we achieve a great deal of our results \nin the international market, issues such as rising infla-\ntion in Turkey have arisen as specific challenges. Along \nthe same lines, the complicated energy scenario and the \nchain that has been destabilized by the war in Ukraine \nhave affected both the exportations and our local pro-\nduction platforms. On the other hand, there is growing \ndemand and interest from local governments in expand-\ning industrial and agricultural production - which, in 2022, \nencouraged us to take measures such as the inauguration \nof new plans and entering into new joint ventures.\nIn Asia, we should note a scenario that combines a de-\nmand for food and a slowdown in growth, with particular \neconomic challenges for China after the decline of the \nCovid Zero policies that the country has been subject to \nin recent years and which affected the production chains \nand economic and commercial results. On the other hand, \nthe demand for animal protein has remained high, with \npositive perspectives for companies capable of address-\ning the trade protection measures adopted by this mar-\nket, a situation which has also been noted in the Middle \nEast.\nIn order to minimize its risk exposure and \ncontain the impact of the rising prices, BRF \npromoted actions designed to make its \nchain more efficient\n53\nOur strategy\nCulture and \nEngagement\nValue Generation\nIndicators  \nand annex\n3\n4\n5\n6\nOur way of \ndoing business\n2\nPresentation1\n2022 Integrated  \nReport\nAllocation of capital GRI 2-6\nGrounded in our business vision and a cycle of strong \ninvestments over recent years designed to\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BRF<|><organization><|>BRF is a leading food company operating globally, with a focus on high-value segments, innovation, and expanding its product portfolios, especially in the pork market in Brazil and international markets.
