Total energy usage includes scope 1 and 2 consumption and car hire and private cars used for business purposes. Conversion factors issued by the UK \nGovernment's former BEIS department are applied to convert distance travelled data to kWhâ€™s. Actual consumption is captured from a variety of sources including \nmeter readings, supplier reports and supplier invoices where actual or estimated consumption is provided. Where actual data is not available, consumption is \nestimated based on, but not limited, to previous consumption trends. \n2. Scope 1 (direct) emissions are from the combustion of fuels as part of stationary sources e.g. natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas, and from combustion of fuels \nin company owned and leased controlled mobile combustion sources, e.g. company vehicles. Release of anaesthetic gases from medical procedures and refrigerant \nlosses are also included. Scope 2 (indirect) emission sources are from purchased electricity and district heating and cooling. Our reported selected scope 3 \n(indirect) emissions are from i) category 3: well-to-tank and transmission and distribution (T&D) losses associated with scope 1 and scope 2 energy consumption \nand ii) category 6: business travel which includes air and train travel, taxis, car hire and employee vehicles (business mileage only). Other scope 3 'value chain' \ncategories are being finalised and will be published in due course. \nA number of emission factor sets are used in the calculation of GHG emissions including BEIS, International Energy Agency (IEA) and the Australian Clean Energy \nRegulator (CER). For 2022, emission factors issued by IEA and CER (scope 2) are applied on a prospective basis.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
