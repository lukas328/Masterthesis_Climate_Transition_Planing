Looking further \nahead, we plan to expand the range of Scope 3 \noperational emissions we measure further as new \ndata and methodologies become available to us. \nWe monitor our overall operational carbon \nperformance both by assessing our emission \nreduction in absolute terms as well as using \nintensity metrics to normalise for merger and \nacquisition (M&A) activity. Our chosen intensity \nmetric tracks market-based (reflecting emissions \nfrom electricity that we have procured) Scope 1 \nand 2 emissions per full-time employee (‘FTE’)  \nas shown in figure 26. We also use a per floor  \narea metric to assess the energy efficiency of  \nour occupied spaces, which uses location-based \n(reflecting the average emissions intensity of grids \non which energy consumption occurs) emissions as \nit allows us to capture electricity saving measures. \n0.380.38 0.34\n2019 2020 2021 20220.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\n1.7\n1.23\n0.98\n0.79\n Actual \n Target\n0\n1,000\n2,000\n3,000\n4,000\n5,000\n6,000\nScope 1 Scope 2 Scope 3 – Business Travel\n4,203\n4,913 4,812\n2,684^\n2019 2020 2021 2022 2019 2020 2021 2022 2019 2020 2021 2022\n3,702\n3,266\n21 7^\n760\n1,040\n356\n1,149^\n1 Size up exposure\nOperations\nWe have significantly \noutperformed our \ntarget, achieving our \n2025 target in 2022.\n55\nPhoenix Group Holdings plc Net Zero Transition Plan\nInvest Engage Lead\nEmbedding net zero \nin our business\nBecoming a \nnet zero business Measuring our progress\nExecutive \nsummary\nTable 10: Operational decarbonisation strategy \n1.

This  \nwas at a period where there was very limited detail \non the definition of ‘material emissions’; these were \nset out more clearly in SBTi guidance that emerged \nin 2021 and beyond. \nIn particular, our 2025 net zero target involves \nfollowing the 1.5°C pathway closely whilst using \ncarbon removal credits to compensate for the \nremaining emissions, including business travel, \nfrom 2025 onwards. Thus, we would continue to \nreduce emissions in absolute terms in line with \nscience-based targets whilst still fully neutralising \nour residual emissions every year thereafter. \nScope 1 and 2 emissions are a mandatory inclusion \nin our SBTi commitment and form the entirety of \nthe operational emissions included in our target \nsubmission.
