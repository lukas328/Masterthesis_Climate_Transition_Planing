Mike also visited an optical/auditory \nstore and a dental clinic in Australia and care homes \nin New Zealand. Feedback on Bupa’s culture and \nthe local leadership team was very positive with \nimprovement requests relating to technology, \ndata and pace of change. \nThe Board has found this feedback extremely useful \nand has provided feedback to local management \nteams where relevant. \nSenior succession and talent review \nDuring the year, the Board considered talent reviews \nof senior executives in the BGUK and ELA Market Units \nin addition to its regular review of senior talent below \nCEC level and succession plans for each CEC member. \nThe reviews considered the quality of our senior \nleadership talent pool to deliver the Group’s strategy \nand transformation. It also takes diversity and inclusion \ninto account with 43% of identified future leaders \nbeing female. \nSustainability and ESG governance \nSustainability and ESG issues are a key focus for \nthe Board and a core pillar of our 3x6 strategy. \nEffective oversight of sustainability-related risks and \nopportunities are essential to Bupa’s ability to execute \nthe strategy and achieve long-term sustainable growth. \nA sustainability and ESG governance and oversight \nframework is in place to ensure that there is sufficient \noversight of these areas at both senior management \nand Board level and that management have clearly \ndefined accountabilities to ensure that sustainability \nremains a priority for the organisation and is factored \ninto decision-making every day. \nBoard oversight \nThe Board has overall responsibility for establishing, \nand approving any changes to Bupa’s sustainability \nstrategy, on the recommendation of the Board \nSustainability Committee.
