Includes the consumption of electricity and fossil fuels (diesel, natural gas and LP gas), \nexcept fuels consumed in fleets.\nIII.  Emissions derived from direct energy consumption (fossil fuels) and calculated based \non the emission factors of 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. \nFor its conversion to CO2e, the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report and the IEA have been used as \nsources. As of 2021, the emissions derived from the use of the vehicle fleet and from refrigerant \ngas leaks in our facilities were included in this scope, applying the DEFRA emission factors to \ncalculate CO2e emissions in all geographical areas, including T urkey.\nIV. Emissions derived from electricity consumption and calculated based on the contractual \ndata and, failing that, the latest emission factors available from the IEA for each country.\nV. Emissions derived from electricity consumption and calculated based on the energy mix of each \ngeographical area. The emission factors are the latest available according to IEA for each country.\nVI. Indirect emissions derived from business trips (plane and train), waste management and \nemployee travel, using the emission factors published by DEFRA in 2022. Substantial increase \nin 2022 compared to 2021 due to the elimination of travel restrictions of business after the \npandemic and the return of employees to the workplace in a hybrid model. For the commuting \nemissions of our employees, only Commuting commutes by Central Services employees have \nbeen taken into account, incorporating in 2022 the data from T urkey (2,320 tons CO2e), which \nin 2021 were not included for this category.\nVII. The impact of greenhouse gas emissions for 2022 is calculated using only Scope 1 and 2 \nemissions and using the CO2 social cost factor based on a proportional estimate of the 2020 \nEPA social cost of carbon ($51/tCO2) and for 2025 ($56/tCO2), (3% discount rate, with an \nexchange rate of €1,153/$).\nVIII. The data for 2021 differs from that published in the previous Non-Financial Information \nReport because the estimates included at the end of the 2021 financial year have been replaced \nby the actual consumption available after the publication of said report and certain values have \nbeen modified according to to the corrected data.\nP.  100\nBBVA Report on TCFD 2022\nThis English version is a translation of the original in Spanish for information purposes only.

T o do \nthis, it uses tools such as its Environmental \nand Social Framework or the Equator \nPrinciples, which have an environmental and \nsocial focus.\nEnvironmental and social \nframework\nIn 2020, the Environmental and Social \nFramework for the mining, agribusiness, \nenergy, infrastructure and defense sectors \n(hereinafter the Framework) was approved.\nThe Framework, which is reviewed annually, \nprovides a series of rules and exclusions in \nrelation to transactions and clients operating \nin these five sectors, as they are considered \nto have a greater social and environmental \nimpact. The Framework is public and \navailable on the BBVA shareholders and \ninvestors website. \nT o carry out its effective implementation, \nBBVA receives advice from an independent \nexternal expert who performs due diligence \non the clients covered by the Framework in \norder to mitigate the risks associated with \nthese sectors.\nFor the annual Framework review, new \nmarket trends, the expectations of \nstakeholders and the strengthening of the \nimplementation procedures are considered. \nIn the last review, dated October 202228, the \nmain new features were as follows:\n Elimination of exceptions to coal bans for \ncountries with high energy dependence \nand no viable alternatives.\n New restriction in the energy sector, \nwith a prohibition to finance “new \nprojects or expansion of existing oil & \ngas exploration, drilling and extraction \nprojects (conventional and non-\nconventional). ”\n New restriction in the agribusiness sector, \nwith the prohibition to finance “projects in \nkey biodiversity areas of the International \nUnion for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), \nthe Brazilian Amazon and the Cerrado. ”\n Inclusion of new biodiversity and anti-\ndeforestation best practices for clients, \nsuch as benchmark standards. \n28. Please note that simultaneously to the publication of this report, an \nupdated Environmental and Social Framework dated March 2023 has been \npublished, in order to give a greater specificity to the coal phase-out target.\nEquator Principles\nEnergy, transport and social service \ninfrastructures, which drive economic \ndevelopment and create jobs, can have an \nimpact on the environment and society. \nBBVA, evaluates the financing of projects to \nreduce and avoid negative impacts and, in \nthis way, enhance their economic, social and \nenvironmental value.\nAll decisions to finance projects are \nbased on the criterion of principle-aligned \nreturns. This implies meeting stakeholder \nexpectations, considering the social demand \nfor the fight against climate change and \nrespect for human rights.\nSince 2004 BBVA has adhered to the \nEquator Principles (EP), which include \na range of standards for managing \nenvironmental and social risk in project \nfinance, which were developed on the basis \nof the International Finance Corporation’s \n(IFC) Policy and Performance Standards \non Social and Environmental Sustainability \nand the World\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BBVA<|><organization<|>BBVA is a financial institution that addresses environmental, social, and natural capital risks through frameworks like the Environmental and Social Framework and the Equator Principles, focusing on impact prevention and mitigation in sectors such as mining, energy, and infrastructure)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Environmental and Social Framework<|><organization<|>The Framework for BBVA, approved in 2020 and reviewed annually, establishes rules and exclusions for sectors with high social and environmental impact, including restrictions on financing new oil & gas projects and projects in key biodiversity areas)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Equator Principles<|><organization<|>BBVA adheres to the Equator Principles since 2004, which are standards for managing environmental and social risks in project finance, based on IFC standards, aimed at reducing negative impacts of energy, transport, and social infrastructure projects)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BBVA Shareholders and Investors Website<|><organization<|>The platform where BBVA publishes its Environmental and Social Framework, making it accessible to the public and stakeholders)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BBVA<|><organization<|>BBVA is a bank that evaluates project financing to ensure environmental and social sustainability, considering stakeholder expectations, climate change mitigation, and human rights)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>October 2022<|><event<|>The date of the latest review of BBVA's Environmental and Social Framework, which introduced new restrictions on coal, oil & gas exploration, and projects in biodiversity-sensitive areas)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BBVA<|><organization<|>BBVA is involved in impact prevention and mitigation through tools like the Environmental and Social Framework and the Equator Principles, focusing on sectors with significant social and environmental impacts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Turkey<|><geo<|>Turkey is mentioned as part of the geographical areas where BBVA applies emission factors for calculating indirect emissions from electricity consumption and employee travel)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BBVA<|>Environmental and Social Framework<|>BBVA developed and reviews the Framework to regulate its environmental and social impact management<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BBVA<|>Equator Principles<|>BBVA adheres to the Equator Principles to guide project financing decisions<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>October 2022<|>Environmental and Social Framework<|>The latest review of the Framework was conducted in October 2022, updating restrictions and standards<|>8)\n##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
