The group is also involved from time to time in the course of its business in legal proceedings and actions, engagement with regulatory authorities and in dispute \nresolution processes. These are reviewed on a regular basis and, where possible, an estimate is made of the potential financial impact on the group. In appropriate cases a provision is recognised \nbased on advice, best estimates and management judgement. Where it is too early to determine the likely outcome of these matters, no provision is made. Whilst the group cannot predict the \noutcome of any current or future such matters with any certainty, it currently believes the likelihood of any material liabilities to be low, and that such liabilities, if any, will not have a material \nadverse effect on its consolidated income, financial position or cash flows. \nFollowing the sale of its Health business in May 2022, the group has been engaged in correspondence with the purchaser of the Health business, Veranova Bidco LP regarding certain warranties in \nthe sale and purchase agreement (the “SPA”) dated 16th December 2021. The purchaser has issued a claim against the group entities in connection with: i) certain alleged representations said to \nhave been made during the course of the negotiation of the SPA; and, ii) certain warranties given in the SPA at the time of signing. Having reviewed the claim with its advisers, the group is of the \nopinion that it has a defensible position in respect of these allegations and if required, it will vigorously defend its position. The outcome of any legal proceedings relating to this matter is not \ncertain, nor is the group able to make a reliable estimate of the possible financial impact at this stage, if any. \n1. A previously disclosed contingent liability relating to failures in certain engine systems for which the group supplied a particular coated substrate as a component for that customer’s emissions after-treatment systems was settled on mutually acceptable terms with no admission of fault, see note 4. \n33 Transactions with related parties \nThe group has a related party relationship with its associate, its post-employment benefit plans (note 24) and its key management personnel (below). Transactions between the Company and its \nsubsidiaries, which are related parties of the Company, have been eliminated on consolidation and are not disclosed in this note. \nDuring the year the group recharged transition related costs of £8 million (2022: £nil) to related parties. The amounts owed by related parties were £3 million at 31st March 2023 (31st March 2022: £nil).  \nThe key management of the group and parent company consist of the Board of Directors and the members of the Group Leadership Team (GLT).
