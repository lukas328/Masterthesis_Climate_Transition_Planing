We look forward to welcoming \nBarbara Jeremiah to the Board in July 2023. Barbara’s appointment will further enhance our \nBoard’s skills and experience, and she will also take on the role of Senior Independent Director. \nFurther information on the changes to the Board members’ roles and responsibilities can be \nfound in the Nomination Committee report on page 90.\nThe Board understands the importance of diversity and inclusivity, and the innovative thinking and \nchallenge it brings to the boardroom. I am pleased to report that plans are in place for the Board’s \ncomposition to meet the ambitions set out in the FTSE Women Leaders Review for listed companies \nto have at least 40% of female representation on the board with at least one of the senior board \npositions (chair, chief executive officer, senior independent director or chief financial officer) \nto be held by a woman by the end of 2025.\n Read more about the Board’s composition and Board diversity policy on page 93\nWe have spent much of our time discussing the future of Johnson Matthey, our strategy, current \nperformance and the plans in place to catalyse the net zero transition. We have supported and \nchallenged senior leadership to ensure the continued acceleration of our transformation programme. \nWe have also reviewed some of our previous strategic decisions and evaluated the learnings from these \nprocesses to continuously improve and challenge management in a robust and constructive way. As a \nresult of these discussions, there are several actions we will be taking to improve the Board’s governance \nprocesses. In addition, the Board reviewed some of the wider governance processes to ensure they \nsupported our fast-paced cultural ambition. As part of that review, we approved a simplified delegation \nof authority framework. \nI am pleased to report that this year’s board effectiveness review confirmed that we continue to \noperate effectively and have made good progress against the actions recommended in last year’s \nreview.
