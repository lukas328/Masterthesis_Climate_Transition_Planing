The exposure to \nindividual banks is monitored frequently against internally-defined limits, together with each \nbank’s credit rating and credit default swap prices. At 31st March 2023, the maximum net \nexposure with a single bank for cash and deposits was £37 million (2022: £101 million), \nwhilst the largest mark to market exposure for derivative financial instruments to a single \nbank was £11 million (2022: £7 million). The group also uses money market funds to invest \nsurplus cash thereby further diversifying credit risk and, at 31st March 2023, the group’s \nexposure to these funds was £521 million (2022: £137 million). The amounts on deposit at \nthe year end represent the group’s maximum exposure to credit risk on cash and deposits. \nExpected credit losses on cash and cash equivalents are immaterial. \nForeign currency risk \nThe group operates globally with a significant amount of its profit earned outside the UK. The \nmain impact of movements in exchange rates on the group’s results arises on translation of \noverseas subsidiaries’ profits into sterling. The largest exposure is to the euro and a 5% (5.8 \ncent (2022: 5.9 cent)) movement in the average exchange rate for the euro against sterling \nwould have had a £11 million (2022: £9 million) impact on underlying operating profit. The \ngroup is also exposed to the US dollar and a 5% (6.0 cent (2022: 6.8 cent)) movement in the \naverage exchange rate for the US dollar against sterling would have had a £10 million (2022: \n£10 million) impact on underlying operating profit. This exposure is part of the group’s \neconomic risk of operating globally which is essential to remain competitive in the markets in \nwhich it operates. \nThe group matches foreign currency assets and liabilities (where these differ to the functional \ncurrency of the relevant subsidiary) to avoid the risk of a material impact on the income \nstatement resulting from movements in exchange rates. The group does, however, have \nforeign exchange exposure on movements through equity related to cash flow and net \ninvestment hedges. A 10% depreciation or appreciation in the US dollar and euro exchange \nrates against sterling would increase / (decrease) other reserves as follows: \n \n10% depreciation 10% appreciation \n2023\n£m \n2022\n£m \n2023\n£m \n2022\n£m \nCash flow hedges 5 5 (8) (7)\nNet investment hedges 5 20 (8) (25)\nFor the net investment hedges, these movements would be fully offset in reserves by an \nopposite movement on the retranslation of the net assets of the overseas subsidiaries. \nInvestments in foreign operations \nTo protect the group’s sterling balance sheet and reduce cash flow risk, the group has financed \nmost of its investment in the US and Europe by borrowing US dollars and euros, respectively. \nAlthough much of this funding is obtained by directly borrowing the relevant currency, a part \nis achieved through currency swaps which can be more efficient and reduce costs. \nThe group has designated US dollar and euro loans and a cross currency swap as hedges of net \ninvestments in foreign operations as they hedge changes in the value of the subsidiaries' net \nassets against movements in exchange rates. The change in the value of the net investment \nhedges from movements in foreign currency exchange rates is recognised in equity and is \noffset by an equal and opposite movement in the carrying value of the net assets of the \nsubsidiaries. All critical terms of the hedging instruments and hedged items matched during \nthe year and, therefore, hedge ineffectiveness was immaterial.
