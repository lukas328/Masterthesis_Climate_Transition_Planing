This new methodology guides companies in these \nsectors in estimating how much and how quickly they \nneed to mitigate their emissions related to land use, \naccording to the target of the Paris Agreement to limit \nglobal warming to 1.5°C.\nIn practice, this commitment has driven us to seek \noperational efficiency in our processes, for which we are \nprepared to deal with extreme situations and events, \ninvest in technological modernization, always aiming \nfor more sustainable solutions, and engage the entire \nproduction chain in the decarbonization of their opera-\ntions, with public targets based on science, in line with \nglobal methodologies. This agenda is in accordance with \nthe importance given to the matter by our stakeholders \nin the materiality process performed last year , whilst it \nalso directly engages with the BRF Sustainability Plan and \nour monitoring indicators and metrics. We recognize the \nimpact of the issue on our business, as well as the risks \nand opportunities that we can create as a result of the \nenvironmental footprint of the BRF operations and value \nchain.\nIn 2022, to assist in the process of prioritizing the initia-\ntives, in partnership with the Getulio Vargas Foundation \nwe developed a carbon pricing methodology, allowing us \nto collect data on the financial impact of the carbon in our \nprojects and assist us in assessing the risks and opportu-\nnities involved in the global scenario. By measuring this \nvariable, the Company is now able to assess, compare and \nprioritize strategic investments incorporating this new \nperspective. \nDespite the uncertainties concerning the implementation \nof a regulated market in Brazil being a challenge, we \nare working to improve the pricing tool with the aim of \ndeveloping practical knowledge and increase our ability to \nadapt to a future mandatory scenario.\nManagement of the BRF climate agenda is performed \nat different hierarchical levels. Since 2021, we have had \na Net Zero Committee, which is composed of members \nof the senior management and the technical areas, with \nthe aim of discussing the progress of the Net Zero plan \nand identifying opportunities that support the reduction \nof the emission of greenhouse gases in both our own \noperations and those involved in our value chain. The \nstatus of the Net Zero Plan is also reported to the Board \nof Directors. \nWe are committed to reduce Scope 1 and \n2 emissions by 35% \nand Scope 3 emissions by\n12.3% \nby 2030, this being our medium-term \ntarget within our commitment to Net \nZero\nR$ 93.2 million \ninvested in climate change\n103\nValue Generation5\nOur way of \ndoing business\nOur strategy\nCulture and \nEngagement\nIndicators  \nand annex\n3\n4\n6\n2\nPresentation1\n2022 Integrated  \nReport\nPerformance \nGRI 305-1, 305-2, 305-3, 305-5, TCFD-4.b SASB-FB-MP-110a.1, SASB-\nFB-MP-110a.2\nWe are one of the 27 founders of the Brazilian GHG \nProtocol and for more than a decade now we have \nregularly published an inventory of our emissions \nof greenhouse gases in the Public Emissions Report \nRecords. \nAmongst the good practices implemented, we have \nrecently digitalized our greenhouse gas emissions \ninventory process, involving automated collections and \nanalyses, thereby improving accuracy and facilitating the \ntracking of the information. Furthermore, as a means of \nsupporting the commitment, as well as the integrity and \ntransparency of our processes, we submit the Scope 1 \nand Scope 2 inventories to an annual third party audit. \nSince 2009, we have been included in the B3’s Carbon \nEfficient Index (ICO2), and for more than ten years our \nICO2 and ICDPR70\nWe are listed in the leading indexes \nthat attest to our commitment to the \nagendas linked to carbon emissions \nand climate change\ninventory has held the Gold Seal awarded by the Brazilian \nGHG Protocol Program, which certifies us at the program’s \nhighest level, ensuring transparency and reliability in the \nreported data.
