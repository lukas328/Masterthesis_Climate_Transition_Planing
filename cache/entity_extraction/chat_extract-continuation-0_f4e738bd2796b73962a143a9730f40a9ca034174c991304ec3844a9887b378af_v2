training efforts, as well as supporting employees \nthrough different resource groups � This is largely made possible by \nthe region's well-established DEIB Committee, which continues to \ndrive all of these different efforts with the strong support of its \nmanagement �\nSimilarly, our Latin American region, supported by its management, \nhas begun transforming its DEIB taskforce into a robust DEIB \nSteering Committee that will continue to forge employee resource \ngroups, as well as awareness-raising efforts and communications � \nOur Mediterranean and Asia Pacific regions are following

\nDiversity Taskforce � \nWe have also continued our partnership with Above & Beyond’s \nDiversity Council, a strategic alliance of global, Nordic -based \ncompanies, which seeks to promote diversity and inclusion around \nthe world � As part of this, for the second year in a row, we also \nparticipated in the Lead the Future role model campaign that seeks \nto attract more women into STEM � Similarly, we have monthly \nconsultations with BSR to stay up to date with the latest DEIB \ndevelopments around the world �\nWhile we are making positive change towards diversity, equity, \ninclusion, and belonging, this will be an ongoing journey � We are \nthrilled to continue working towards being the most inclusive \nworkplace within the renewable energy industry � \n \nT o truly
