Its purpose is to reassure stakeholders that we have fully considered and \nunderstand a broad range of risks and are managing them in line with defined risk appetites.\nThe Board, which is ultimately accountable for risk management and internal controls, \nevaluates how effective these systems are at mitigating principal and emerging risks at least \nonce every year. The GLT provides support for the Board’s reviews, which ensures the risks \nwe’ve identified are relevant to our current aims and strategic goals. The Audit Committee \nsupports the Board in assessing the effectiveness of our risk management and internal control \nsystems, processes and policies.\nOur risk management methodology takes a top-down approach to identify our principal risks \n(i.e. from board level down) and a bottom-up approach to identify operational risks (i.e. from \nday-to-day level up). We’re constantly looking to improve how connected and aligned these \napproaches are as they operate in parallel.\nHow we manage risk\nWe apply the three-lines-of-defence methodology. The first line represents business \noperations, or the individuals who, employing effective internal controls, own and manage \nrisk daily. Governance and compliance, the second line, are represented by the functions and \nbusinesses of the group that oversee and monitor these operations. The third line refers to the \nindependent assurance that our Group Assurance function provides over these activities.\nFunctions, businesses and site teams are responsible for identifying, assessing and prioritising \ntheir risks. They also consider how likely it is that a risk will materialise and what effect that \nwould have on our objectives. This includes reviewing whether a risk has changed, how strong \nthe controls we use to manage the risk are and whether mitigating actions are in place. \nWe use a self-assessment and management attestation processes to report, at least once \na year, on whether the relevant controls are effective. This is a maturing process with several \ninitiatives in progress to improve our controls environment.\nIn the past 12 months, we have continued to improve how we address and monitor risks \nin a number of ways, including:\n• Making continued enhancements to our GRC platform, JMProtect, which offers a combined \nand centralised view of our risk universe and controls framework\n• Incorporating JMProtect risk data into our audit planning process to make sure the highest \nrisk areas of the business are prioritised for assurance activities\n• Introducing an Integrated Assurance model that aligns second- and third-line assurance \nactivities for easier collaboration and more effective risk-based assurance.\nWe prioritise insurance cover for the most significant areas of risk across the Group, and areas \nwhere insurance is a legal or contractual requirement. If insurance is available on \ncommercially reasonable terms, we also utilise it as a risk mitigation tool across our wider \nbusiness. Where appropriate, we get advice from industry to help us assess risks and develop \nmitigation plans.\nEmerging risks and opportunities\nWe continually monitor our external risk landscape using a mixture of key risk indicators, third \nparty reports, findings from internal and external assurance providers, and feedback from both \ncustomers and suppliers. This information allows us to identify emerging risks and prepare \nreasonable mitigations. \nFor any identified emerging risks, considered to be a threat to JM or its value chain, we tailor our \nresponse to the size of the risk to ensure our mitigation strategy is proportionate. For example, \nin 2022, we identified significant emerging risks in relation to geopolitical tensions, the \nmacroeconomic downturn and energy availability. We have chosen to include geopolitical \nand macroeconomic events as a principal risk given our global presence and strategic plans \nin various geographies including China and USA. This will also ensure we incorporate lessons \nlearned from ceasing operations in Russia.\nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 2023 63\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER
