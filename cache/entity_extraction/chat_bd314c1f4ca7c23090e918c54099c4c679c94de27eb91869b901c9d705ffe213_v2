We have come a long way since activists protested against \nour financing of oil, gas and coal in 2010. In 2011, we launched our Environmental, Social & Ethical (ESE) \nRisk Framework, which required enhanced due diligence for certain lending and loan underwriting customer \nrelationships, transactions, activities and projects. We recognise that through our financing activity \nNatWest Group may contribute to climate change. As the initial iteration of our Climate transition plan illustrates, \nwe are committed to playing our part in addressing the climate challenge, but we cannot transform the real \neconomy on our own. Ultimately, success will be determined by societyâs willingness to adapt, supported by \nconsistent, long-term government policy and continuing technical innovation.\n20212015 2020 2022 2025 2030 2050\nTask Force on \nClimate-related \nFinancial Disclosures \n(TCFD) created by the \nFinancial Stability Board\nBank of England publishes SS3/19, \noutlining how banks should manage \nclimate-related financial risks\nAnnounced our purpose-led \nclimate ambition\nSBTi issues financial services sector \nscience-based targets guidance\nFirst major UK bank to join Partnership for \nCarbon Accounting Financials (PCAF)\nFounding members of Glasgow Financial \nAlliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), Net Zero \nBanking Alliance (NZBA) and members of \nPowering Past Coal Alliance\nAnnual General Meeting Say \non Climate resolution\nScience-based targets \nvalidated by SBTi for 79% of \nour lending book and own \noperational emissions.\nInitial iteration of Climate \ntransition plan developed\nLaunched Carbon Planner to \nsupport customer transition\nLaunched Carbonplace \nTarget to provide Â£100 billion climate and \nsustainable funding and financing between \n1 July 2021 and the end of 2025.
