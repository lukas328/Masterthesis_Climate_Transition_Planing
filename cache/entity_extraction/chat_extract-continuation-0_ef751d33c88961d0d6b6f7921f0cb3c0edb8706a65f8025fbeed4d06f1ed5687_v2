This is due to updated bills, data provision and extrapolations.\n(1) Our own operational emissions reporting year runs from the 1st of October 2021 to the 30th of September 2022..\n(2) NatWest Group defines direct own operations as our Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 (paper, water, waste, business travel, commuting \nand work from home) emissions. It therefore excludes upstream and downstream emissions from our value chain.\n(3) Upstream emissions relate to the Scope 3 Categories 1-8 under the Greenhouse Gas Protocol.\n(4) Downstream emissions relates to the Scope 3 Categories 9-15 under the Greenhouse Gas Protocol.\n(5) Our operational value chain is Scope 1, Scope 2, Scope 3 (Categories 1-15, with categories 8, 10, 14 excluded and Category 15 \nreported in section 5.5. For further details please refer to our 2021 NatWest Group plc Climate-related Disclosures Report where these \ncategories are described in more detail.\n(6) The SBTi recommends that companies invest to mitigate emissions beyond their value chain while they transition towards a state of net \nzero emissions. In accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, emission reductions cannot be achieved through the use of carbon \ncredits.\n(7) Using green tariffs and purchased renewable electricity certificates.\n(8) Increase resource efficiency and the circular economy to ensure resources are valued and nothing is wasted. Further, zero waste will \nrequire us to maintain our zero landfill to waste achievements, with a goal to divert 95% of all waste from landfill and incineration.\n(9) Category 1 and 2 emissions have been estimated using spend data and publicly sourced sector-specific emission factors.\n(10) While progress is currently 3%, we are expecting the exit of Republic of Ireland activities to result in our fleet size further decreasing in \nsize by 56%. The remaining fleet electrification by 2025 is planned in line with lease renewals and monitored through our own operations \nexecutive steering group.\n72NatWest Group plc | 2022 Climate-related Disclosures Report\nGovernance Strategy and Climate transition plan Risk Management and Scenario Analysis Metrics and TargetsIntroduction\nOwn operational 2022 value chain\nThe charts opposite show a break down by emissions category of our direct own operational emissions during 2022 \nand our upstream and downstream operational value chain emissions, which we are reporting for the first time.\nNatWest Group uses the Greenhouse Gas Protocol to measure its emissions across Scopes 1, 2 and 3, where \nthe latter is split into 15 categories. For a breakdown of these categories within our reporting scope, as well as a \ndescription of upstream reporting limitations, please see page 67 in our 2021 Climate-related Disclosures Report.\nData assumptions and limitations relating to preliminary estimates of operational value chain emissions:\n • We have used methodologies aligned to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol to estimate our preliminary emissions on \nour operational value chain.\n • Category 9 emissions use customer numbers to estimate the distance commuted to our branches.\n • Category 11 emissions analyses time spent on our app and website.\n • Category 12 emissions use paper and card numbers to estimate waste.\n • Category 13 uses our leased net internal area and intensity metric.\n • Data improvement programmes to review our preliminary estimations may cause these figures to be updated in \nthe future.\nAs shown in the downstream chart opposite, downstream emissions have reduced by less than direct and \nupstream emissions. This is because downstream emissions are driven mainly by how our customers commute to \nour branches and use our products, and as such is more difficult for us to directly influence.\nEnergy\nFollowing the return to the office after the easing of COVID-19 restrictions, we focused on the practice \nof using energy more efficiently and effectively in our operations and reviewed our processes \nto reduce consumption. These reviews include:\n • Building energy optimisation: our building plant equipment is continuously reviewed to maximise energy \nefficiency. Data analytics are used to proactively identify anomalous consumption, ensuring our buildings run \nmore efficiently.\n • Energy audits: there have been audits carried out in most of our buildings this year to identify where we can \nimprove energy efficiency and reduce consumption and this work will continue in 2023.\n • Data centres: we have consolidated our data centres to allow for more efficient IT architecture using fewer \nresources. The work carried out ensures that they run more efficiently, with lighting upgrades and optimisation \nof the data hall environmental controls already seeing a significant reduction in water and power usage.\n • Renewable electricity: in 2021, we committed to a Corporate Power Purchase Agreement (cPPA), bringing \nadditional renewable generation capacity online to facilitate the decarbonisation of the UK grid. We are \ncontinuing to work towards this with additional cPPAs, and once constructed they are expected to generate \n59% of NatWest Group’s electricity demand in the UK by 2024.\n • Leased buildings: for our leased buildings in India, we are working with the landlords to review the scope for \nidentifying energy-saving opportunities, assessing end of life for equipment, and creating an energy efficient \nreplacement plan where possible.\n • Colleague engagement: we launched a bank-wide energy campaign in the second half of 2022 to help \neducate and engage our colleagues by sharing tips on how to reduce consumption at home and in the office \nthrough a series of activities, raising the importance of energy saving actions. This is an ongoing campaign \nwhich we will continue to work on in 2023.\n2022 Breakdown of downstream operational \nvalue chain emissions (tCO2e)(*)\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NATWEST GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>NatWest Group is a financial services organization that reports on its operational emissions, climate strategy, and energy efficiency initiatives, including commitments to renewable energy and emissions reduction across its value chain)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REPUBLIC OF IRELAND<|>GEO<|>Country from which NatWest Group plans to exit activities, leading to a decrease in fleet size by 56%)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DATA PROVISION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Refers to the processes and systems used by NatWest Group to collect and report data on emissions, energy, and operational metrics)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PAGE 74 AND 75<|>EVENT<|>Specific pages in the report where detailed data and updates are provided)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>2021<|>EVENT<|>Year when NatWest Group last reported updated values before 2022)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCOPE 1<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Scope 1 emissions refer to direct emissions from NatWest Group’s owned or controlled sources)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCOPE 2<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Scope 2 emissions relate to indirect emissions from purchased electricity, steam, heating, and cooling consumed by NatWest Group)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCOPE 3<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Scope 3 emissions include other indirect emissions across 15 categories, such as upstream and downstream activities in the value chain)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GREENHOUSE GAS PROTOCOL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Framework used by NatWest Group to measure and report greenhouse gas emissions across Scopes 1, 2, and 3)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ENERGY AUDITS<|>EVENT<|>Audits conducted in NatWest Group buildings to identify opportunities for energy efficiency improvements)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DATA CENTRES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Data centres are consolidated to improve IT efficiency, reduce water and power usage, and optimize environmental controls)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Refers to the renewable energy initiatives, including corporate Power Purchase Agreements (cPPAs), aimed at decarbonizing the UK grid and meeting electricity demand with renewable sources)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COLLEAGUE ENGAGEMENT<|>EVENT<|>A campaign launched in 2022 to educate and involve employees in energy-saving practices at work and home)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ENERGY CAMPAIGN<|>EVENT<|>Initiative to promote energy efficiency among colleagues, ongoing into 2023)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATWEST GROUP<|>REPUBLIC OF IRELAND<|>NatWest Group plans to exit activities in the Republic of Ireland, reducing fleet size by 56%<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATWEST GROUP<|>PAGE 74 AND 75<|>Detailed data and updates on emissions and energy use are provided on these pages<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATWEST GROUP<|>2021<|>Reported values from 2021 serve as a baseline for 2022 updates<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATWEST GROUP<|>SCOPE 1<|>Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions from owned or controlled sources<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATWEST GROUP<|>SCOPE 2<|>Scope 2 emissions relate to purchased electricity and energy consumption<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATWEST GROUP<|>SCOPE 3<|>Scope 3 emissions include upstream and downstream activities across 15 categories<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATWEST GROUP<|>GREENHOUSE GAS PROTOCOL<|>Framework used for measuring and reporting emissions<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATWEST GROUP<|>ENERGY AUDITS<|>Audits are conducted to identify energy efficiency improvements<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATWEST GROUP<|>DATA CENTRES<|>Data centres are consolidated for efficiency and environmental benefits<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATWEST GROUP<|>RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY<|>Initiatives include cPPAs to increase renewable energy use<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATWEST GROUP<|>COLLEAGUE ENGAGEMENT<|>Campaign to promote energy-saving practices among employees<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
