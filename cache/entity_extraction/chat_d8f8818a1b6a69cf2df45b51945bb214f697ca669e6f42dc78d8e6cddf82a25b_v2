To accommodate this approach to materiality, we may \noccasionally have regard to new frameworks and standards when we believe that doing so may allow us to better \nunderstand and address climate-related matters. \nThis report uses longer time frames to assess potential impacts than those time frames customarily used in \ncertain of our other disclosures, including our annual, periodic and interim financial reports filed with the London \nStock Exchange (‘LSE’) in the United Kingdom and the Securities and Exchange Commission (‘SEC’) in the United \nStates. This approach to materiality means that this report, and many of our climate-related disclosures, including \nwith respect to climate-related risks and opportunities, include certain information that we have not included in our \nLSE and SEC filings for which we use a different approach to materiality. \nOur approach to materiality in this report and in other climate-related disclosures also means that statements \nmade in this report and in our other climate-related disclosures use a greater number and level of assumptions \nand estimates than many of our LSE and SEC filings. These assumptions and estimates are subject to change over \ntime, and, when coupled with the longer time frames used in these disclosures, make any assessment of materiality \ninherently uncertain. In addition, our climate risk and impact assessment capabilities and net-zero transition \nstrategy and plan remain under development, and the data underlying these and market practice in relation to \nthese disclosures also remain subject to evolution and change over time. \nThe information in this report includes non-financial metrics, estimates or other information that are subject \nto significant uncertainties, which may include the methodology, collection and verification of data, various \nestimates and assumptions, and/or underlying data that is obtained from third parties, some of which cannot \nbe independently verified. As a result, we expect that certain disclosures made in this report may be amended, \nupdated, recalculated and restated in the future as the quality and completeness of our data and methodologies \ncontinue to improve.\nIn this section\n1.1 Welcome from our Group Chief Executive\n1.2 Our climate strategy\n1.3 Climate progress highlights\n1.4 Our transition to net zero \n1.5 TCFD: Climate-related disclosures overview\n1\n3NatWest Group plc | 2022 Climate-related Disclosures Report\nGovernance Strategy and Climate transition plan Risk Management and Scenario Analysis Metrics and TargetsIntroduction\nA plan for change\nWe want to deliver a more sustainable economy and \nfuture for the customers and communities we serve, \nwhich is why addressing climate change – one of the \nmost critical issues of our time – is a strategic priority \nfor the bank. It sits at the heart of our purpose, \nbecause we know that tackling climate change is not \nonly good for the planet, but good for our customers \nand our business too.\nNatWest Group has established itself as a leading \nvoice for finance on tackling climate change. In 2022, \nwe worked alongside the UK Government to support \nthe UK Pavilion at COP27, co-hosting several \nhigh-profile events with customers and key \nstakeholders such as the Sustainable Markets \nInitiative. Closer to home, through our climate \nresolution, the Board gave shareholders their ‘Say on \nClimate’ asking them to support our strategic direction \non climate change at the AGM. The resolution was \nendorsed by the vast majority of our shareholders, \nindicating strong support for our climate strategy.\nReceiving the Sustainable Markets Initiative’s Terra \nCarta Seal – which recognises organisations that are \ndemonstrating their commitment to, and momentum \ntowards, the creation of sustainable markets – \nacknowledges the progress we have been making \ntowards our purpose and climate ambitions.\nSignificantly, NatWest Group has become the first UK \nbank, and one of the largest banks globally to date, \nto have science-based targets validated by the \nScience Based Targets initiative (SBTi). These targets \nunderpin the initial iteration of our Climate transition \nplan (published in this report), which outlines the steps \nwe aim to take to at least halve the climate impact of \nour financing activity by 2030 and achieve our net \nzero climate ambition by 2050.\nWe recognise that achieving our climate ambition and \ndelivering the initial iteration of our Climate transition \nplan is dependent on a number of factors beyond \nour control, including technological innovation and \nchanges in consumer behaviour. Crucially, as Mission \nZero: Independent Review of Net Zero by the Rt Hon \nChris Skidmore MP highlighted, there is an urgent \nneed for consistent, long-term policy commitment \nfrom government in order to harness the growth \nopportunities generated through the transition to  \nnet zero.\nSupporting our customers\nMeanwhile, with increasing pressure on energy \nsupplies and the rising cost of living, we have \ncontinued to help our customers navigate the \ntransition to net zero. With practical support such \nas the launch of a Green Homes Retrofit Pilot and \ninnovative solutions such as the EPC awareness \nfeature in our customer mortgage portal, we continue \nto help customers better understand their emissions \nand the steps they can take to reduce their carbon \nfootprint. And to help businesses in their transition to \nmore sustainable practices, we reduced the threshold \nfor our universal Green Loan for SMEs from £50,000 \nto £25,001.\nWe have now provided £32.6 billion of climate and \nsustainable funding and financing against our target to \nprovide £100 billion between 1 July 2021 and the end \nof 2025, which includes £27.2 billion across \nCommercial & Institutional, as well as mortgage \nlending for EPC A and B homes totalling £5.1 billion in \nRetail Banking and £0.2 billion in Private\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
