The Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero , November 2021.\n35 GFANZ uses the term “orderly transition” to refer to a net-zero transition in which both private-sector action and public-policy \nchanges are early and ambitious, thereby limiting economic disruption related to the transition (e.g., mismatch between renewable \nenergy supply and energy demand). For reference, the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), which develops \nclimate scenarios used by regulators and others, defines “orderly scenarios” as those with “early, ambitious action to a net zero \nCO2 emissions economy,” as opposed to disorderly scenarios (with “action that is late, disruptive, sudden and/or unanticipated”). \nIn an orderly transition, both physical climate risks and transition risks are minimized relative to disorderly transitions or scenarios \nwhere planned emissions reductions are not achieved. (NGFS. NGFS Climate Scenarios for Central Banks and Supervisors , 2020.) \nThe Paris Agreement, Article 4.1 , highlighted that achievement should be “on the basis of equity, and in the context of sustainable \ndevelopment and efforts to eradicate poverty,” and the agreement acknowledged that “human rights, the right to health, the rights \nof indigenous peoples, local communities, migrants, children, persons with disabilities and people in vulnerable situations and the \nright to development, as well as gender equality, empowerment of women and intergenerational equity” are equally important.\nthis decade to around $4 trillion by 2030 to limit \nwarming to 1.5 degrees C. 32 In addition, other \nstudies estimate cumulative global investment \nrequirements of US$109 –$275 trillion to reach \nnet-zero emissions by 2050.33 GFANZ was founded \nbecause investment of this scale requires the \nmobilization of the entire financial system. 34\nThe private financial sector has the scale to \nmobilize the necessary capital and financing with \nmore than 500 financial institutions, representing \naround 40% of global financial assets, committed to \nthe goal of net zero by 2050 through membership \nin one of the financial sector-specific alliances \ncomprising GFANZ. With deliberate and ambitious \naction, alongside government and real-economy \nefforts, the financial sector can help enable a global \ntransition to net zero that helps avoid the worst \nimpacts of climate change, minimizes firm-specific \ntransition risks and stranded assets as well as \nbroader risks to financial stability, and is just and \norderly35 across countries and communities.\nIn addition, governments and regulators of some of \nthe world’s largest economies are requiring financial \ninstitutions and real-economy firms to disclose \nclimate-related risks and opportunities, including \nCONTENTS  |  FINANCIAL INSTITUTION NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLANS — FUNDAMENTALS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND GUIDANCE\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
