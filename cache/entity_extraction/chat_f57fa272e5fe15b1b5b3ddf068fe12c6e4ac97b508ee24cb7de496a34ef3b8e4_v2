We aim to partner with the expected winners in the markets for fuel \ncells and electrolysis, and to do this we have put customer-led growth at the heart of our \ncommercial strategy. We look to partner with strategic customers early in their development \ncycle. These are partners that we believe have the capabilities to win in their markets. \nOur partnership with Plug Power is proof that this approach is working.\nRaw materials Components\nStack assembly and \nsystems integration Application\nFuel cells\nElectric current\nAir\nWater\nHydrogen\nCatalyst \ncoated \nmembrane \n(CCM)\nMembrane \nelectrode \nassembly \n(MEA)\nHydrogen\nElectric current\nWater\nOxygen\nElectrolyser\nEnd-user markets\nPrecious metal recycling\nFocused on delivering performance-defining components for the hydrogen economy\nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 202320\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION\nAccelerating the hydrogen economy \nwith Plug Power\nSynergy in action\nBusinesses across the global economy are looking at hydrogen as a way of decarbonising. \nWe work to leverage existing relationships with Clean Air customers to provide a range \nof sustainability technologies to the automotive industry. Many of Catalyst Technologies’ \ncustomers are also exploring hydrogen as a cleaner fuel alternative to hydrocarbons. \nThey face a choice between blue hydrogen and carbon capture or powering themselves \nwith green hydrogen. We can then complete the end-to-end value chain through our \nPGMS capabilities, from sourcing to end-of-life recycling. Whatever our customers choose, \nJohnson Matthey is there to support them.\nIn early 2023, we announced a new, \nlong-term partnership with Plug Power, \na global leader in the hydrogen value \nchain. As the company’s strategic partner, \nwe will provide the catalysts, membranes \nand catalyst coated membranes \nPlug needs to reach its revenue target \nof US$20 billion by 2030.\nNot only are we bringing our catalysis \nexpertise, precious metal supply security \nand unique recycling capabilities to the \ntable, but we are also co-investing in what \nwill likely be the largest CCM manufacturing \nfacility in the world – expected to begin \nproduction in the US in 2025.\nThe partnership is a game-changer for \nthe hydrogen economy. Plug Power is a \nleading player in building an end-to-end \ngreen hydrogen ecosystem, helping \ncompanies like Amazon and BMW \ndecarbonise. Its decision to partner with \nus is not only a demonstration of our \nexpertise in CCMs – but proof that our \nmanufacturing capabilities have the \npotential to bring new scale and volume \nto the emerging hydrogen economy.\nAn essential part of the transition to net zero\nAchieving net zero requires a range of technologies. Fuel cells using hydrogen provide an \nalternative to diesel, without the associated emissions. We believe the market for hydrogen-\npowered heavy duty trucks and stationary systems will see significant growth towards 2030.\nThe predicted rapid market growth and demand are coming at us faster than ever before, \npartly due to significant regulatory changes to support commercial scale projects for production \nand infrastructure – such as the Inflation Reduction Act in the US and the UK’s Automotive \nTransition Fund. The convergence of these market changes shines a spotlight on our \ntechnologies, builds rapid growth and moves the dial on the transition to net zero. \nOur performance in 2022/23\nWe made major progress towards all of our strategic goals this year. Our sales have doubled \nover the course of 2022/23, and we achieved our goals of expanding our customer base, \nannouncing long-term strategic partnerships with Plug Power and Hystar. We are seeing \na trend of businesses that have previously tried to manufacture CCMs by themselves talking \nto us about working together in the future. Demand from existing customers is increasing too. \nThe underlying operating loss of £45 million primarily reflects increased investment into \nproduct development and building capability as we scale the business to meet customer \ndemand, partly offset by higher volumes.\nAlthough we faced the same inflationary pressures as the rest of Johnson Matthey in 2022/23, \nour business was less impacted by volatility and economic headwinds. This is due to us \noperating in a rapidly growing market that has benefited from regulatory support. \nWe have three main priorities for 2023/24. One, to continue focusing on commercial \nperformance and developing new and existing partnerships; two, increasing our production \ncapacity, with our major site in Royston completing construction, as well as projects starting \nin the US and China. Finally, we continue to invest in the next generation of our technology, \nboth on our own and alongside our partners. Our R&D will focus on continuing to improve \nproduct efficiencies, including reducing utilisation of precious metals such as iridium within \nelectrolysis CCM as well as optimising activity of platinum catalysts in fuel cells.\n Watch: ramping up to reach net zero:  \nmatthey.com/hydrogen-for-net-zero\nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 2023 21\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION\nHydrogen Technologies continued\nSustainability\nEmbedding sustainability into everything we do \nWe are a global leader in sustainable technologies.
