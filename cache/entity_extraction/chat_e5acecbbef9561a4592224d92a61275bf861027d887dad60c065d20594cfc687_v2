requiring \nrapid action and economic transition globally if we are to avoid \nthe impacts of catastrophic global warming. The transition also \nrepresents an opportunity through unprecedented investment \nin new, clean technologies.\nAs the UK’s largest long-term savings and retirement business, \nPhoenix Group has a strategically important role in supporting \nglobal efforts to transition to a net zero economy for the benefit \nof our customers, shareholders, society and all stakeholders.\nThe case for action at global and\nwhole-economy level 14\nThe case for action for Phoenix Group 16\nOur net zero ambitions 17\nOur Climate Action Model 18\nClimate change nexus with Human rights, \nthe just transition and nature  19\nBecoming a  \nnet zero business\n13\nPhoenix Group Holdings plc Net Zero Transition Plan\nInvest Engage Lead\nEmbedding net zero \nin our business\nBecoming a \nnet zero business Measuring our progress\nExecutive \nsummary\n13\nPhoenix Group Holdings plc Net Zero Transition Plan\n2022\n2021\n2020\n2023\nEmissions (MtCO2e)\n2024\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\n2031\n2032\n2033\n2034\n2035\n2036\n2037\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n600\nThe case for action at global \nand whole-economy level\nT o remain on track to limit global \ntemperature rises to 1.5°C, urgent \naction is required. This need for \naction is particularly stark given the \nlatest Intergovernmental Panel on \nClimate Change (‘IPCC’) synthesis \nreport warning that we are likely to \nbreach 1.5°C in the 2030s1, as we are \nnot currently on track to meet the \nneed to reduce global emissions by \n45% against 2010 levels by 20302. \nIn the last two years, we have seen governments \nand companies beginning to set targets \ncommensurate with the challenge. At COP26 in \n2021, we saw commitment from governments with \naround 90% of global emissions now covered  \nby net zero targets3. \nHowever, commitments have not automatically led \nto action. Many countries are not on track to deliver \ntheir existing nationally determined contributions \nand the majority of these plans fall short of limiting \ntemperature rises to 1.5°C. It is estimated that \ncurrent national action plans will actually see \nglobal emissions rise by 11% by 2030, and the  \nUN Emissions Gap report showed current policies \npoint to a global temperature rise of 2.8°C by the \nend of the century. \nLimiting temperature rises to 1.5°C requires \n‘wide-ranging, large-scale, rapid and systemic \ntransformation’ without delay4. This is particularly \npertinent in the UK where the Climate Change \nCommittee’s (‘CCC’) 2022 Progress in Reducing \nEmissions report found either some risks, \nsignificant policy risks or insufficient plans for 61% \nof the required emissions reduction to meet the \nSixth Carbon Budget (the volume of greenhouse \ngases the UK can emit during the period 2033–\n2037), as shown in the figure 5 opposite. \nThe physical consequences of not acting quickly \nenough to tackle climate change are becoming \never clearer, and successive climate models have \nrevised downwards the temperature at which \nsevere impacts will occur 5. We are experiencing \nthe effects of climate change already: 2022 saw \nrecord temperatures in the UK, water shortages \nin Europe, wildfires in North America, an \nunprecedented heatwave in China and  \nextreme flooding in Pakistan. \nFigure 5 – Assessment of UK stated policy impact  \non delivering emissions reductions6\nThere are significant risks to achieving the UK’s Sixth Carbon Budget with credible policy plans  \nin place for 39% of the required emissions reduction.\n1 IPCC AR6 Synthesis Report.\n2 Net Zero Coalition | United Nations.\n3 Science-based targets – Net Zero Standard.\n4 Emissions Gap Report 2022 – UNEP.\n5  Towards more transparent and robust climate-change risk assessments – Nature.\n6 CCC 2022 Progress Report to Parliament.\n Baseline\n Unexplained emissions reductions\n Credible plans \n Some risks \n Significant risks\n Ins\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
