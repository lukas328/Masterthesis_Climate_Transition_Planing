The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission requires certain employers to submit EEO-1 data (workforce demographic data) annually.\nThe Quality team considers a broad range of ESG factors that may influence the \nsustainability of a company’s business model, which can include how a company \nmanages diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). Electronic Arts (EA) is the largest \nindependent video game publisher in the West, owning gaming intellectual \nproperty including FC (formerly FIFA), The Sims, Madden and Apex Legends. \nWe have been interacting with the company on DEI since 2021. This was in \nresponse to a series of DEI-related controversies in the gaming industry, most \nnotably surrounding Activision Blizzard. This analysis was enhanced in the \nreporting period by our new proprietary DEI analysis toolkit (see page 21). \nFrom these engagements, the investment team took comfort regarding the \nsteps EA has been taking to manage DEI risks and opportunities. It has been \nencouraging to see EA increase its DEI transparency and commitments, \nvoluntarily disclosing EEO-1 diversity data 7 and setting quantitative representation \ngoals. With a 46% increase in underrepresented talent in executive roles over \nthe last two years, there is clear evidence of progress. In addition to EA hitting its \nhiring targets, we were pleased to hear that the Chief Diversity Officer partners \nwith each business unit to create a specific, data-driven DEI plan for each one. \nThis, and the fact that DEI is a component of yearly remuneration, suggests that \nmanagement recognises the importance of this issue in attracting and retaining \ntalent, and growing its customer base. \nEquities\nThe Emerging Market Sovereign Debt investment team seeks to make a \nforward-looking assessment of ESG trends, using a proprietary ESG trend \nscore to assess the sustainability risk for each country. If a country is doing \nwell and heading in a positive direction, it is viewed as a positive scoring \ncountry, even if it may start from a low absolute ESG score. A country \nwith perhaps better absolute ESG levels but that is trending negatively is \nscored poorly.\nFixed Income\nQuality: exploring the social \nside of gaming\nEmerging Market Sovereign Debt: \nscoring sovereign governance\nSustainability and Stewardship Report\n20\nIn the reporting year, the team continued to score Zambia well from an ESG \nperspective, with a particularly strong governance score. In its view, Zambia is \nmoving towards becoming a country where the rule of law is respected, civil \nsociety is allowed to speak freely, and economic policy is slowly moving in the right \ndirection under an IMF programme. The investment team has held a Zambia position \nacross the fixed income platform explicitly with a view to taking the bonds through \nrestructuring, based on a positive view on recovery and with an understanding that \ndefault was a high possibility. The team is positive on the structural reforms under \nPresident Hichilema, which are likely to boost foreign direct investment over the \ncoming years while also improving institutional quality and capacity. \nThe Multi-Asset team uses a thematic macro framework to identify big-picture \ntailwinds and headwinds that may influence investment outcomes. Climate \nchange is one of the themes addressed in the framework.
