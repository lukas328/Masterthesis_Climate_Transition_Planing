But we have also gone further to set targets on issues such \nas human rights, community impact and recycling which are not typically seen in the \nchemicals industry.\n You can read more about our Materiality Statement on page 23\nDecarbonising modern life\nIt’s time for the world to move beyond fossil fuels and harness the power of more sustainable \nlow carbon fuels, chemicals and industrial processes.\nSustainable fuels\nOutlook\nMany countries are setting transport \ntargets for sustainable fuels or to phase out \ninternal combustion engines. JM’s \ntechnology helps create low carbon \noptions such as renewable (green) or low \ncarbon (blue) hydrogen and fuel cell \ntechnology, as well as developing entirely \nnew types of fuel from alternative \nfeedstocks, such as waste. \nOpportunities and challenges\nThe demand for sustainable fuels is \nexpected to grow significantly over the \nnext 20 years. But a lot of work is still \nneeded to find low carbon solutions for  \nthe aviation, maritime and heavy duty \nvehicle sectors in particular. \nWhat we are doing\nOur methanol process and catalyst \ntechnology used in Chile’s Haru Oni project \nconverts CO2 captured from the air to \nproduce 550 million litres of e-fuels \nannually, enough for approximately \n220,000 gasoline vehicles. Our Fischer \nTropsch (FT) CANS™ technology (co-\ndeveloped with bp) and HyCOgen™, which \nalso use CO2 and green hydrogen, were \nselected by Aramco and Repsol for one of \nthe earliest synthetic fuel plants, in Spain. \nWe continue our research into using \nalternative feedstocks for aviation and other \nfuels, innovating to maintain technology \nleadership in these emerging markets. \nSustainable chemicals\nOutlook\nDemand for primary chemicals is expected \nto grow by 25% by 2030. The industry \ncurrently accounts for 18% of the world’s \nCO2 emissions. Increasingly, customers are \nlooking to combine alternative, \nsustainable feedstocks with catalyst \ntechnologies that can turn them into \nuseful products.\nOpportunities and challenges\nThere are two pillars of decarbonisation \nfor the chemical industry. The first pillar \nis carbon reduction through process \noptimisation and adding carbon capture \nand storage technology to current \nprocesses. The second is carbon \nreplacement, using more sustainable \nfeedstocks. We have been turning \ntraditional feedstocks into synthesis gas \n(syngas) for decades. Syngas, a mix of \ncarbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and \nhydrogen, is essential in enabling the \ndecarbonisation of chemical processes, \nsince it can also be made from alternative, \nmore sustainable feedstocks. \nWhat we are doing\nFor both pillars of decarbonisation, \nwe have developed leading process \ntechnologies. For example, under the \nCLEANPACE brand, we can retrofit existing \nassets, enabling the reduction of carbon \nemissions from those processes  \nby up to 95%.\n1\nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 20236\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION6 Johnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 2023\nCreating a circular \neconomy\nCleaner air, healthier \npeople\nAn evolving regulatory \nlandscape\nGeopolitical and \neconomic volatility\n2 3 4 5\nOutlook\nIf global consumption levels continue to \ngrow at the current pace, there will simply \nnot be enough natural resources to go \naround. So we need to put the right \nprocesses in place and embed circularity \ninto how we source and use materials. \nOpportunities and challenges\nWe are already the world’s largest PGM \nrecycler by volume. The amount of CO2 for \nan ounce of recycled PGM is 30-50 times \nlower than newly mined PGM. We can \nreduce the carbon footprint of our \nproducts but also our customers’ too in \nautomotive, industrial, chemical and life \nsciences applications. We are applying our \nlongstanding recycling expertise to \nemerging technologies, including fuel cell \nand electrolyser stacks to enable circularity \nin the hydrogen economy.\nWhat we are doing\nWe understand the full life cycle of the \nPGMs in our products and continue to \nwork with our partners to enable greater \nrecycling and refining at the end of their \nlife. We are investing in our global refining \ncapabilities so that we are better \npositioned to deal with the increasing \nvolume and range of materials we will \nneed to recycle in the future. And in our \ninnovation and R&D processes, we take \n”design for recycling” into account right \nfrom the start. \nOutlook\nAir pollution kills millions of people every \nyear and the majority of the world’s \npopulation are continually exposed to poor \nair quality. With increasing urbanisation, \nthis problem looks set to intensify unless \nsignificant action is taken to reduce \nharmful emissions.\nOpportunities and challenges\nWe know that transitioning the world’s \ntransport systems to net zero is a long \nand complex process. While alternative \npowertrains, such as fuel cell and battery \nelectric, continue to develop, automotive \ncatalysts will be needed in engines using \ndrop-in sustainable fuels. We need to be \ndoing all we can to ensure the vehicles \non our roads now are as clean\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
