For the time being, it is important to note that the amounts presented are estimates.\nUnderwriting is an important part of the NWM Group’s business and the facilitated emissions related to this activity \ncould potentially be significant. analysis on the bottom left indicates the following:\n • The financed emissions from the power utilities sector constitutes 50% of NWM Group’s estimated facilitated \nemissions, of which 63% are green bonds(1) that are expected to have a lower emissions footprint. However, the \nsame emission intensity was applied regardless of issuance type.\n • The second highest contributing sector is the automotive industry with 15% of the estimated facilitated \nemissions, while only representing 3% of NWM Group’s total underwriting.\n • Building materials make up 14% of the estimated facilitated emissions, however, all of these issuances, \nwere green bonds(1).\nThe remaining 10 sectors contributed 21% to the estimated facilitated emissions analysis making up 66% of \nthe total underwriting of which 20% were green and sustainability bonds(1).\n90NatWest Group plc | 2022 Climate-related Disclosures Report\nGovernance Strategy and Climate transition plan Risk Management and Scenario Analysis Metrics and TargetsIntroduction\nCaution about climate metrics challenges.\nClimate metrics, including aims, ambitions, estimates, forecasts, plans, projections and targets and other climate \nmetrics used in this report, especially if they are forward-looking, merit special caution as they are more uncertain \nthan metrics based solely on factual historical financial information. \nClimate metrics in this report include, among others:\n • estimates of historical emissions, such as financed emissions, absolute emissions, and various emissions intensity \nmetrics, implied temperature rating or estimates of historical climate change, temperatures and other \ninformation; or\n • forward-looking climate metrics, such as ambitions, targets, climate scenarios and emissions intensity pathways, \nand estimated climate projections and forecasts. See ‘Caution about climate-related and other forward-looking \nstatements and metrics in this report’ below.\nThe evolution of climate change and its impacts is highly uncertain, as are the metrics and methodologies used to \nmeasure, estimate and report those impacts and emissions. Accordingly, both historical and forward-looking climate \nmetrics are more inherently uncertain and, therefore, less reliable than metrics based on historical financial statements. \nThere are many significant uncertainties, assumptions and judgements underlying climate metrics that \nlimit the extent to which climate metrics are reliable. The most important of these are: \n1) Risks inherent in climate-related data \nMeaningful reporting of climate-related risks and opportunities and their potential impacts and related metrics \ndepend on access to accurate, verifiable, reliable, consistent and comparable climate-related data. The financial \nsector is grappling with risks related to data availability and quality and access to data on a timely and verifiable \nbasis. The most important of these risks are:\n • Climate-related data may not be generally available from counterparties or customers or, if available, is generally \nvariable in terms of quality and, therefore, may not be accurate, verifiable, reliable, consistent, or comparable.\n • In the absence of accurate, verifiable, reliable, consistent, and comparable climate-related data, financial \ninstitutions necessarily rely on aggregated information based on high-level sector data developed by third \nparties that may be prepared in an inconsistent way using different methodologies, interpretations, or \nassumptions and therefore such data may not be accurate.\n • Data is less readily available for some asset types and there may also be data gaps, that are filled using “proxy” \nor other data, such as sectoral averages, again developed in different ways.\n • There is no single, global, cross-sector data provider that adequately and consistently covers the needed scope \nfor data to analyse emissions and assess physical and transactional risks across operations and portfolios.\nVoluntary and mandatory climate-related frameworks vary in their data quality measurement, and the way \nin which customers collect and disclose asset-level climate data also varies significantly.\n • While regulators and standard setters begin to mandate additional disclosure of verified climate-related  \ndata by companies across sectors, there are potential gaps between needed and available data.\nPoor quality and availability of high-quality historical and current emissions, or subsector data is currently a \nsignificant obstacle to the calculation of carbon-related metrics.
