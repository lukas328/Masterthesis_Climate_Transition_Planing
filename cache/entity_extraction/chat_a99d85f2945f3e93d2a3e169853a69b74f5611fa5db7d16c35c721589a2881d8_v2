Given \nthe growing demand for data and digital \nconnectivity, we recognise the need for us to \ntake further steps and expedite our activity.\nThis report details the progress we have made \nand the plans we have in place.\nWe are dedicated to innovating our network \ntechnology and operations to support our \njourney towards net zero, helping to drive the \ntransition to a low-carbon future for our planet \nand its people.\nVodafone UK’s emissions \nreduction targets\nVodafone has set ambitious goals to reduce \nour greenhouse gas emissions. Our long-\nterm, SBTi-validated science-based target \nis to achieve net zero emissions across our \nentire value chain globally by 2040. This \ninvolves an absolute reduction of our Scope \n1, 2, and 3 emissions by at least 90% by 2040. \nAdditionally, we aim to halve our value chain \n(Scope 3) emissions by 2030.\nVodafone UK is striving to reach net zero for \nour operational emissions (Scope 1 and 2) by \n2027, expediting our global targets.\n \nVodafone UK has already reduced its \noperational carbon emissions by 93% since the \nbaseline year. We are now focussed on further \nreducing our energy use, enhancing the \nefficiency of our network and investing in new \ntechnology and renewable generation.\nScope 1, 2 and 3 emissions\nGreenhouse gases (or ‘GHGs’), such as carbon \ndioxide (CO 2 ) and methane (CH 4 ), cause \nclimate change by trapping heat within the \nearth’s atmosphere. The more GHG emissions \nthat are released, the faster the planet warms \nup. There are three classifications used to \nmeasure GHG emissions:\n \n• Scope 1 emissions are directly released \ninto the atmosphere when a company \nburns fossil fuels (such as petrol, diesel \nor natural gas) in equipment it operates \nor industrial processes, or releases gases \ncontaining GHGs (such as fluorinated \ngases or ‘F-gases’), which can leak from \nchemicals used in cooling equipment or fire \nsuppressant systems. \n• Scope 2 emissions are those released into \nthe atmosphere to generate the energy \npurchased and used by a company in its \noperations (e.g. the emissions released \nby a power plant to generate electricity). \nScope 2 emissions can be calculated based \non the location where the energy is used \n(called ‘location-based’) or on contractual \nCommitments and data overview\n2024 | Carbon Reduction Plan Vodafone UK   \n3\nIntroduction   |  The Detail   |  Completed Projects   |   Future Projects   |   Sign-off \nagreements (such as renewable energy certificates) that specify the source used to generate \nthe energy (called ‘market-based’).  \n• Collectively, Scope 1 & 2 emissions are known as operational emissions. \n• Scope 3 emissions are released into the atmosphere as an indirect result of the company’s \nactivities or business model. They originate from the production of goods and services that \nthe company buys (upstream emissions), the use of its products or services by its customers \n(downstream emissions) or the activities that it finances through its investments. \n \n• Collectively, Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions are known as full value chain emissions.\nOur baseline emissions \nBaseline emissions are the reference point against which emission reductions can be measured. \nVodafone’s baseline year for reporting carbon data is FY20 and total operational emissions in this \nyear were 93,514 tonnes of CO 2e.\nEmissions Total\n(tonnes CO2e)\nScope 1 9,806\nScope 2 83,708\nScope 3 N/A 2\nTotal Emissions  93,514\n(Scope 1 and 2 only)\n\n2024 | Carbon Reduction Plan Vodafone UK   \n4\nIntroduction   |  The Detail   |  Completed Projects   |   Future Projects   |   Sign-off \nThe detail\nCurrent emissions\nOur current emissions relate to the most \nrecent carbon data against which our \nprogress can be measured.
