Our TPAs \nfocus on three key factors: level of ambition, credibility of plan and \nimplementation of plan.\nDuring the reporting year, we evolved the TPA to reflect differences in \nhow some industries will decarbonise. By tailoring certain indicators, \nwe have focused the assessments more precisely on the areas of \nhighest net-zero impact for each company. For example, our mining \nsector TPA has an additional indicator to assess the extent to which \na company’s strategy includes new exploration or expansion of high-\ncarbon products, such as thermal or coking coal. These tailored \nindicators focus our analysts’ attention on the key areas for intervention \nwithin a sector and inform strategic engagements.\nWe have also introduced a framework to assess the extent to which \ncompanies are approaching transition in a fair and inclusive way. This is \nimportant because, without a social strategy and focus, our investments \ncould be subject to business, financial, regulatory, reputational and/or \nlegal risk. Where appropriate, our Just Transition framework is used to \nassess companies on whether: \n ɽ A just transition/social justice is acknowledged in a company’s \ntransition strategy.\n ɽ The company has identified and is engaging affected \nstakeholders on a just transition.\n ɽ The company explains how its just transition strategy will be \nimplemented.\n22\nSustainability and Stewardship Report\n2. Engagement\nEngaging with companies on their transition plans is central to our net-\nzero strategy. During the reporting period, we carried out 70 top-emitter \nengagements, using the output from our TPAs to identify time-bound engagement \nobjectives. We may use other levers, such as proxy voting, to escalate an \nengagement where necessary. We also engage with other material emitters to \nset out our expectations in relation to net zero, including regarding disclosure, \ntarget setting and the development of clear transition plans. Case studies of our \nengagements over the year can be found in the Active Ownership section.\nIn addition to bilateral engagement, Ninety One participates in collaborative \nengagements aligned with our net-zero strategy. These include Climate Action \n100+ (“CA100+”) engagements, which focus on the largest global emitters, and \nthe IIGCC’s Net Zero Engagement Initiative, which includes more companies that \nare significant users of fossil fuels. Further information on these collaborative \nengagements can be found in the Engagement section below. Our engagements \ncovered 75% of our financed emissions over the year to 31 March 2024.\n8. Judgement to be applied when considering significance of impact. >10% of workforce as a rough proxy.\n23\nSustainability and Stewardship Report\nAmbition\nIs a just transition included in the company’s transition strategy?\nCredibilityImplementation\nDoes the company recognise the social \nimplications of climate change?\nDoes the company make any commitment \nto addressing the social implications?\nWorkers\nDoes the corporate \ntransition impact a significant \nproportion of the workforce?8\nCommunities\nDoes the corporate transition \nhave a significant impact on local \ncommunities and consumers?\nSupply chain\nDoes the corporate \ntransition have a significant \nimpact on suppliers?\nIs there \nadequate \ndetail?\nHas there \nbeen adequate \nconsultation \nwith impacted \nstakeholders?\nIs the company \ncollaborating with \ngovernment/\npolicy makers \nwhere required?\nIs the company \nmeasuring and \ndisclosing its \nimpact?\nHas adequate \nresource/\nfunding been \nallocated?\nHas the company identified and engaged affected stakeholders?\nHow will the plan be implemented?\n3. Solutions\nWe believe that enabling clients to invest in climate-change solutions \nand transition opportunities is the most direct way an asset manager \ncan contribute to real-world decarbonisation. Emerging Markets \nTransition Debt (developed in the reporting period and launched in \nApril 2024) is a significant addition to our range of strategies targeting \nthese outcomes. Invested at the intersection of impact and return, it will \noffer an integrated portfolio of private and public debt. Via the strategy, \ninvestors will be able to provide transition finance to emerging markets \n– at commercial rates – to support emissions-avoiding industries and \ninfrastructure, and to facilitate decarbonisation of high emitters by \nfinancing those with credible targets and plans. \nGeneral risks.  The value of investments, and any income generated from them, \ncan fall as well as rise. Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future results. \nInvestment objectives and performance targets may not necessarily be achieved, \nlosses may be made. Environmental, social or governance related risk events or \nfactors, if they occur, could cause a negative impact on the value of investments.\nSpecific risks.  Sustainable Strategies: Sustainable, impact or other sustainability-\nfocused portfolios consider specific factors related to their strategies in assessing \nand selecting investments. As a result, they will exclude certain industries and \ncompanies that do not meet their criteria. This may result in their portfolios being \nsubstantially different from broader benchmarks or investment universes, which \ncould in turn result in relative investment performance deviating significantly from \nthe performance of the broader market.\nDuring the year, we also developed an investment strategy that aims \nto promote sustainable and inclusive economic growth in South Africa \nthrough debt funding of public and private sector infrastructure. The \nstrategy will help to facilitate the flow of private investments into a \nbroad range of high-quality South African infrastructure projects, \nincluding those enabling South Africa’s energy transition. Among them, \nthe KaXu Solar One project will add 100 megawatts of solar-generated \nelectricity to the national grid every year.\nWe continue to deploy capital\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
