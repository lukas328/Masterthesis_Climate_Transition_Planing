In case of a discrepancy, the Spanish original will prevail.\nSECTION 02 / STRATEGY\nSpeciﬁcally, over the course of 2022, the Bank engaged in the following initiatives:\nSince January\nBBVA has been a member of the \nMassachusetts Institute of T echnology's \n(MIT Climate and Sustainability \nConsortium or MCSC) to accelerate the \nimplementation of large-scale solutions to \nﬁght climate change. \n2022\nSince April\nBBVA has co-chaired the Climate Finance Leadership \nInitiative in Colombia (CFLI). This is an initiative of the \nGlasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero to speed up the \nglobal transition to net zero greenhouse gas emissions. In May\nBBVA joined the Edison Alliance, with the \ncommitment of the BBVA Microﬁnance Foundation \nto support the digital inclusion of vulnerable \npopulations in Latin America. \nSince September\nBBVA has been a member of the European High \nLevel Expert Group (HLEG) that provides \nrecommendations to the European Commission \nto boost sustainable ﬁnance in emerging \ncountries. BBVA is the only private-sector bank in \nthis group. In mid-2023, the group will present its \nrecommendations on transformative, innovative \nactions to mobilize private-sector ﬁnance. \nIn July\nBBVA became a founding member of Carbonplace, \nthe global platform through which customers around \nthe world will be oﬀered access to voluntary carbon \ncredits to oﬀset their emissions.\nIn November\nAs part of the Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders promoted \nby the World Economic Forum (WEF), the Chair of BBVA, \ntogether with other CEOs and leaders of major global \ncompanies, signed a statement in November calling on \nworld leaders and participants in the United Nations \nClimate Change Conference at Sharm El Sheikh (COP \n27) to commit to a just transition.\nA global benchmark\nIn 2022, and for the third consecutive year, BBVA \nobtained the highest score (86 points) among \nbanks in Europe and the second at global level \nin the latest Dow Jones Sustainability Index \n(DJSI). Its Corporate Sustainability Assessment \n(CSA) measures the performance of the largest \ncompanies by market capitalization in economic, \nenvironmental and social matters. The Group \nachieved the highest score (100 points) in the \nsections on financial inclusion, environmental \nand social information, materiality, tax strategy, \ncrime prevention, public influence or lobbying, \nand human rights.\nLikewise, BBVA was included for the fifth \nconsecutive year in the Bloomberg Gender-\nEquality Index 2022, which is recognition of \nthe commitment to create trustworthy work \nenvironments, in which professional development \nis guaranteed and equal opportunities for all \nemployees regardless of their gender. The entity’s \nfirm commitment to diversity and inclusion \nallowed it to improve its rating by five percentage \npoints compared to the previous edition. Garanti \nBBVA, the Group’s subsidiary in T urkey, is also \npart of the index.\nBBVA is a member of the main sustainability \nindices (for more details, see the section \n“Sustainability indices and ratings” in the \nchapter “Report on climate change and\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BBVA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>BBVA is a financial institution actively promoting sustainable finance, participating in various international initiatives, and supporting climate-related efforts globally.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>CFLI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Climate Finance Leadership Initiative (CFLI) is an initiative co-chaired by BBVA in Colombia, aimed at accelerating the transition to net zero greenhouse gas emissions.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>European High Level Expert Group<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A group providing recommendations to the European Commission to promote sustainable finance in emerging countries, of which BBVA is a member.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Carbonplace<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A global platform founded by BBVA that offers customers access to voluntary carbon credits to offset emissions.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>World Economic Forum<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An international organization that promotes global economic cooperation; BBVA's Chair signed a statement as part of its Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>MIT Climate and Sustainability Consortium<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A consortium that BBVA joined to accelerate large-scale solutions to fight climate change.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>European Banking Federation<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A banking industry group that BBVA is associated with, promoting sustainable finance initiatives.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNEP Finance Initiative<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A UN-supported initiative promoting sustainable finance, with which BBVA has been involved since 1998.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>DJSI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Dow Jones Sustainability Index, a benchmark for assessing corporate sustainability performance; BBVA scored highly in 2022.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>UN Global Compact<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A UN initiative promoting corporate sustainability; BBVA supports and reiterates its support for this initiative.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Ecuator Principles<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A set of environmental and social risk management standards for project financing, supported by BBVA.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>PCAF<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials, an initiative that BBVA participates in to measure and disclose financed emissions.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An initiative that BBVA's asset management division is part of, aiming for net-zero emissions in investment portfolios.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A group developing standards for disclosing nature-related financial risks, with which BBVA is involved.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNEP FI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative, a global partnership supporting sustainable finance; BBVA is a member.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>European Banks<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A collective term for banking institutions in Europe, with BBVA being a representative and co-chair of the European Banks' Global Steering Committee.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Climate Finance Leadership Initiative<|>EVENT<|>An initiative co-chaired by BBVA in Colombia to promote climate finance and support the transition to net zero.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>COP 27<|>EVENT<|>The 27th UN Climate Change Conference where BBVA's leadership called for a just transition.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Sharm El Sheikh<|>GEO<|>Location of COP 27, where BBVA's leaders participated in climate discussions.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Colombia<|>GEO<|>Country where BBVA co-chairs the Climate Finance Leadership Initiative.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Latin America<|>GEO<|>Region where BBVA supports digital inclusion through the Edison Alliance.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Turkey<|>GEO<|>Country where Garanti BBVA, a subsidiary of BBVA, is part of the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Garanti BBVA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A subsidiary of BBVA in Turkey, recognized for its commitment to diversity and inclusion.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>European Commission<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The EU body that receives recommendations from the European High Level Expert Group to boost sustainable finance.)##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
