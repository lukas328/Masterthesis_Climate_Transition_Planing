The calculation of the impact of the \nruling on Bupa Chile is dependent on detailed \napplication guidelines which will be issued by \nthe Chilean Superintendent of Health. \nGiven the number of variables in determining \nthe amounts that may need to be returned to \ncustomers, and lack of clarity on how the \nSuperintendent of Health will determine how \nthe ruling would be implemented in practice, \nthe directors have determined that it is not \npossible to reliably estimate the related liability. \nTherefore this is disclosed as a contingent \nliability as explained in Note 28. The directors \nhave disclosed an indication of financial impact \nin relation to the capital held for this matter for \nGroup Solvency II reporting purposes. \nTo address the disclosure of the contingent \nliability we performed the following procedures: \n▪ Evaluated management’s assessment that \nthe Supreme Court Ruling gives rise to a \ncontingent liability, specifically whether a \nreliable estimate can be determined; \n▪ Reviewed announcements made by the \nSuperintendent of Health relating to the \napplication of the Supreme Court Ruling; \n▪ Evaluated the methodology and assumptions \nused to calculate the financial effect of the \ncontingent liability as disclosed in Note 28, \nconsidering whether this in itself provided \na reliable estimate; and \n▪ Assessed whether the disclosures meet the \nrequirements of IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent \nLiabilities and Contingent Assets. \nBased on the procedures performed and the \nevidence obtained, we consider the classification, \nrecognition and disclosure under IAS 37 \nProvisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent \nAssets to be appropriate. \nBupa Annual Report 2022 113 \n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n    \n  \n  \n \n          \n        \n    \n        \n      \n      \n       \n      \n   \n       \n          \n      \n       \n      \n         \n        \n       \n      \n       \n   \n    \n      \n        \n     \n        \n       \n      \n      \n       \n  \n        \n         \n        \n       \n       \n        \n      \n        \n        \n         \n      \n       \n  \n       \n       \n         \n     \n        \n      \n  \n         \n       \n \n         \n      \n \n     \n      \n       \n  \n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n      \n    \n       \n \n    \n     \n   \n      \n     \n  \n      \n     \n       \n        \n  \n       \n      \n         \n         \n          \n      \n      \n   \nStrategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements \nIndependent auditors’ report to the members of \nThe British United Provident Association Limited \ncontinued \nKey audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter \nValuation of \nequity impact \nfrom the \ntransition to \nIFRS 17 (Group) \nRefer to Note 1.6 \n(for accounting \npolicy and \nfinancial \ndisclosures) \nThe impact of the adoption of IFRS 17 on the \nGroup’s net asset value as at 1 January 2022 \nis estimated to be £55m. \nIFRS 17 is a complex accounting standard which \nrequires judgement and interpretation in its \nimplementation. In accordance with IAS 8, \ninsurers, including Bupa, are required to disclose \nthe financial effect of the implementation of \nthe new Standard. \nWe have determined the valuation of the \nestimated impact of IFRS 17 to be a key audit \nmatter because of the significant changes \nintroduced by the standard, including a number \nof new estimates and judgements. For Bupa, \nthe short tailed nature of most of the Group’s \ninsurance liabilities means that it expects to be \nable to apply the premium allocation approach \n(“PAA”) for most insurance contracts; this \nassumption has been the driver of much of \nthe work this year. \nKey areas of focus were: \nUnit of account and contract boundaries \nThe determination of a unit of account and \ncontract boundaries are new considerations \nrequired by the Standard. There is often an \nelement of judgement in how these are \ndetermined and these initial considerations have \ndownstream implications for PAA eligibility and \non the size of any loss component recognised. \nPAA eligibility \nThe majority of Bupa's policies have a coverage \nperiod of one year or less and are therefore \neligible to apply PAA. For policies with a \ncoverage period greater than 12 months, the \nGroup has performed eligibility testing to ensure \nthere is no material difference in applying the \nPAA or the General measurement model \n(“GMM”). There is a small amount of business \naround the Group that is not eligible for PAA \nand for these groups of contracts, the GMM is \napplied. Ensuring the measurement model is \nappropriate is a key judgement of the Standard. \nLoss component \nThe consideration of units of account drive \nonerous contract assessments at a more granular \nlevel than under IFRS 4. Under IFRS 17 loss \ncomponents have been recognised for groups \nof contracts that did not have an associated \nunexpired risk reserve under IFRS 4. \nRisk adjustment \nThe Group has taken the decision to use a \nconfidence level technique to estimate the risk \nadjustment. \nFor the work over the valuation of insurance and \nreinsurance balances under IFRS 17 our \nprocedures included: \n▪ Assessing key judgements and conclusions \nmade within accounting policy papers and \nverifying that business and market units were \napplying these appropriately; \n▪ Assessing the determination of unit of account; \n▪ Performing walkthroughs for new processes \nand assessing changes to systems; \n▪ Evaluating the appropriateness of \nmanagement’s PAA eligibility analysis, including \ntesting the completeness and accuracy of \nsupporting data, evaluating reasonably \nexpected scenarios and testing of the\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
