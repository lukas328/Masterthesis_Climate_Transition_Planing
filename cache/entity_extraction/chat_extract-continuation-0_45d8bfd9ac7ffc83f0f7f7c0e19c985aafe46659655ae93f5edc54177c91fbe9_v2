These are designated and \naccounted for as cash flow hedges. The group’s policy is to hedge between 50% and 80% of \nforecast receipts and payments in foreign currencies over the next 12 months. \nFor hedges of forecast receipts and payments in foreign currencies, the critical terms of the \nhedging instruments match exactly with the terms of the hedged items and, therefore, the \ngroup performs a qualitative assessment of effectiveness. Ineffectiveness may arise if the \ntiming of the forecast transaction changes from what was originally estimated or if there are \nchanges in the credit risk of the group or the derivative counterparty. Hedge ineffectiveness \nwas immaterial during the year.

This swap hedges the movement in the cash flows on \n$100 million of the 3.14% $130 million bonds 2025 attributable to changes in the US dollar / \nsterling exchange rate while the second swap hedges the movement in the cash flows on the \n3.00% $50 million bonds 2029 attributable to changes in the US dollar / sterling exchange \nrate.
