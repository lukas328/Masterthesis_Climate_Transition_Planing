This is underpinned by efficiency benefits of \nc. £55 million in the year.\nIn Clean Air, we expect strong growth in operating performance. Whilst external data suggest \nlimited growth in vehicle production for 2023/24, margin expansion should mainly be driven \nby efficiency benefits. PGM Services’ performance will be largely driven by precious metal \nprices, with recycling volumes expected to be subdued. We expect strong growth in operating \nperformance for Catalyst Technologies. This reflects an improvement in licensing income \nand a significant uplift in margins, benefiting from pricing and efficiencies. We expect sales \nto grow strongly in Hydrogen Technologies and we will continue to invest for growth resulting \nin an operating loss at a similar level to 2022/23.1\nPrecious metal prices have been volatile and consequently it is difficult to predict how they \nmay develop. To illustrate the impact they may have on our results, assuming prices remain \nat their current level2 for the remainder of 2023/24 there would be an adverse impact \nof c. £50 million3 on full year operating performance compared with the prior year. We are \nfocused on mitigating the potential impact on our performance.\nAt current foreign exchange rates4, translational foreign exchange movements for the year \nending 31st March 2024 are expected to adversely impact underlying operating profit by \nc. £10 million.\nDividend\nThe board will propose a final ordinary dividend for the year of 55.0 pence per share at the \nAnnual General Meeting (AGM) on 20th July 2023. Together with the interim dividend of \n22.0 pence per share, this gives a total ordinary dividend of 77.0 pence per share, maintained \nat the same level as the prior year. Subject to approval by shareholders, the final dividend will \nbe paid on 1st August 2023, with an ex-dividend date of 8th June 2023.\nContingent liabilities\nSee note 32 of the financial statements on page 206.\n1. Outlook commentary for Clean Air, PGM Services, Catalyst Technologies and Hydrogen Technologies assumes constant precious metal prices and constant currency\n2. Based on average precious metal prices in May 2023 (month to date)\n3. c. £50 million adverse impact represents a gross PGM price impact before any foreign exchange movement. A US$100 per troy ounce change in the average annual platinum, palladium and rhodium metal prices each have an impact of approximately £1 million, £1.5 million and \n£0.75 million respectively on full year underlying operating profit. This assumes no foreign exchange movement\n4. At average foreign exchange rates for May 2023 month to date (£:US$ 1.25, £:€ 1.14, £:RMB 8.70) translational foreign exchange movements for the year ending 31st March 2024 are expected to adversely impact underlying operating profit by c. £10 million\nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 2023 61\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION\nFinancial performance review continued\nRisk report\nRisk management is important for JM as it enables \nprotection, facilitates value-added insights, helps identify \ncompetitive opportunities and supports the growth \nafforded by the net zero transition.

Risk management is an essential component of our \ngovernance and operations throughout the organisation.
