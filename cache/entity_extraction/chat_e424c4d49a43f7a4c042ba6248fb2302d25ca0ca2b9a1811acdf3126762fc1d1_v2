The temperature score is calculated  \nfor c.£168 billion 2 (c.57% of AUA) that includes \nc.£162 billion of listed equities and credit \n(excluding sovereigns), and c.£5 billion of \ncommercial real estate loans and private \nplacement loans.\nFigure 14: Emissions reduction target coverage1\nUsing the value of our AUA in 2021 for reference, the coverage of our emissions reduction targets \ngrows from £160 billion (53%) of AUA in 2025 to c.£250 billion (81%) in 2030 and c.£310 billion \n(100%) in 2050.\n2\n1  2025 target covers listed equity and credit under our control and \ninfluence and 2030 target covers all assets we control and influence.\n26\nPhoenix Group Holdings plc Net Zero Transition Plan\nInvest Engage Lead\nEmbedding net zero \nin our business\nBecoming a \nnet zero business Measuring our progress\nExecutive \nsummary\nWe use scenario analysis to better \nunderstand our financed emissions \ntrajectory under potential \ndecarbonisation pathways  \nfor the overall economy. \nThe level of action we need to take to meet our \nnet zero targets is heavily dependent on the extent \nof broader economy-wide decarbonisation. We \nhave therefore developed an emissions pathway \nprojection tool which estimates the potential \nimpact of different economy-wide decarbonisation \nscenarios on our financed emissions. \nThe tool uses the Network for Greening the \nFinancial System (‘NGFS’) and Inevitable Policy \nResponse (‘IPR’) family of scenarios to build our \nunderstanding of carbon emission pathways, which \nwe also use to assess our balance sheet’s resilience \nagainst climate risk.\n Plan the journey continued \nScenario analysis and modelling\nThe NGFS family of scenarios is the product of \na suite of integrated assessment models which \ncombine macro-economic, agriculture and \nland-use, energy, water and climate systems into \na common framework. This enables the analysis \nof the complex and non-linear dynamics in and \nbetween these components. The integrated \nassessment models offer detailed representations \nof energy systems, generates cost-effective \ntransition pathways and features several climate \nmitigation options.\nThis is complementary to the IPR family of \nscenarios, which considers ‘real world’ policy \nchanges, and also includes changes in the  \nfood and land system. \nTo complement the NGFS and IPR scenarios and \nreflect recent experience, we have created our \nown ‘Covid bounce-back’ scenario.  Our year-end \n2021 analysis indicates a significant reduction in \nabsolute carbon emissions relative to our year-end \n2019 baseline position. We believe this is primarily \ndue to the global economic slowdown caused \nby Covid-19, so this observed trajectory is not \nnecessarily indicative of future experience as \nthe world emerges from the global pandemic. \nTherefore, the development and use of our own \nscenario has been performed to allow for this \npotential uptick in emissions.\nThe full set of scenarios we consider are outlined \nin Table 3.\nTable 3: Summary of economy-wide decarbonisation scenarios  \nused in our emissions pathway projection tool\nScenario \nfamily\nScenario Description\nNGFS Current policies Existing climate policies remain in place, but there is no strengthening of ambition level, \nleading to a temperature rise exceeding 3°C and severe and irreversible physical \nimpacts. Heightened physical risks are assumed through high climate sensitivity,  \nhigh ice-sheet melt and increasing tropical cyclone risks.\nNationally Determined \nContributions (‘NDCs’)\nPledged unconditional NDCs are implemented fully, and respective targets on energy \nand emissions in 2025 and 2030 are reached. Beyond current NDC target times (2025 \nand 2030), climate policy ambition remains comparable to levels implied by NDCs.\nDelayed transition Imposes the 2°C target in 2100 and allows for temporary overshoot. Annual emissions do \nnot decrease until 2030. Strong policies are then needed to limit warming to below 2°C. \nThis scenario includes regional carbon price variation. Regions with net zero targets are \nmore ambitious than regions without them after 2030.\nDivergent Net Zero The median temperature returns to below 1.5°C in 2100, after a limited temporary \novershoot. Emissions reach net zero around 2050 but with higher costs due to divergent \npolicies introduced across sectors leading to a quicker phase- out of oil use. Carbon \nprices for transport and buildings are assumed to be three times the carbon price in  \nthe supply and industry sectors.\nBelow 2°C Gradually increases the stringency of climate policies, giving a 67% chance of limiting \nglobal warming to below 2°C throughout the 21st century. The scenario assumes medium \n(as opposed to low) use of Carbon Dioxide Reduction (‘CDR’) technology.\nNet Zero 2050 Limits global warming to 1.5°C (the median temperature returns to below 1.5°C in 2100, \nafter a limited temporary overshoot) through stringent climate policies and innovation, \nreaching global net zero CO 2 emissions around 2050. Some jurisdictions such as the US, \nEU and Japan reach net zero for all GHGs. The scenario assumes medium (as opposed to \nlow) use of CDR\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
