N/A\nFertile Broiler \nChickensBeak treatment (beak trimming)\n100% of the breeding stock broiler hens have their beaks \ntrimmed in the hatchery using laser equipment. One third of \nthe beak is trimmed, in the area with fewer nerve receptors;\nBroiler Turkeys Beak treatment (beak trimming)\n100% of the broiler turkeys have their beaks trimmed in the \nhatchery using laser equipment. One third of the beak is \ntrimmed, in the area with fewer nerve receptors;\nswine Tail docking\n100% of the animals farmed under BRF’s global integration \nsystem have their tails docked by the third day of life. This \nprocess is still necessary to maintain the animals’ welfare, \navoiding the risk of cannibalism during the growth and \nfattening phases. We are working to develop an analgesic \nthat will reduce any type of discomfort caused during the \nprocedure.\nCastration: in 2022, BRF achieved another of its public \ncommitments in relation to the reduction of physical alter-\nations in swine From December 2022 on, no swine has \nbeen submitted to surgically castrated without anesthetic. \nRoughly 1% of male pigs intended for the production of \nParma ham are subjected to surgical castration. Following \nmore than two years of experiments, we have begun to \nproduce Prosciutto without the need to surgically castrate \nthe animals. In the rare cases in which surgical castration \nis still necessary (around 0.17%), it will be performed with \nanesthetic.\nCollective gestation: we have adopted a system of \ncollective gestation as mandatory in all of our expansion \nprojects and we are committed to implementing collective \ngestation pens for 100% of our breeding sows by 2026 \nIn 2022, the adaptation of more than 16,500 positions \nmeant that we reached the sum of 53.4% - a rate that we \nintend to raise to 56.3% in 2023.\nSince December 2022, none \nof our swine have been \nsurgically castrated without \nanesthetic\n100\nValue Generation5\nOur way of \ndoing business\nOur strategy\nCulture and \nEngagement\nIndicators  \nand annex\n3\n4\n6\n2\nPresentation1\n2022 Integrated  \nReport\nPercentage of species by type of housing\nType of housing% Turkeys Chickens Pigs\nLow acclimatization (yellow or blue curtains) 12.5 30.1 0\nConventional curtains (open and making full use of the natural \nconditions of the space) 87.5 22.9 0\nHigh acclimatization (black x silver curtains with the use of \ncooling equipment to cool the environment and humidifiers)0 47 0\nCollective gestation 0 0 53.4\nIndividual gestation 0 0 46.6\nMedicines\nIn relation to the use of antibiotics and medicines in \ngeneral, BRF operates in accordance with the scientific \nevidence of antimicrobial resistance in the human \npopulation and with the understanding of the World \nHealth Organization (WHO), that classifies antimicrobials \nin three categories: critically important, highly important \nand important. \nOur team of veterinarians evaluates and ensures \nthe biosecurity, animal welfare prophylaxis, disease \nprevention, and maintenance of animal health, constantly \nseeking alternatives to the use of these drugs in the \nform of vaccines, prebiotics and probiotics. Furthermore, \nhormones to increase growth in the integration of poultry \nand swine are not used. \nIn the BRF global poultry chain, we do not use antibiotics \nclassified by the World Health Organization as harmful to \nhuman health, and we are working to reduce the use of \nthis class of medicines in the pig chain.\nWe only make use of antimicrobials for therapeutic \npurposes, under the evaluation of veterinarians, and only \nwhen injuries have been observed. All the processes are \nnoted on the lot’s monitoring sheet. All the products are \npurchased and supplied by BRF, and integrated producers \nare forbidden from privately using or acquiring them \nthemselves. The grace periods are rigorously observed \nand inspected by the BRF team, with no waste in the \nmeat. In the Sadio Bio line, we do not use any medicines \nin the animal farming, with this process being certified by \na third party.\nIn 2022, the use of antibiotics in broiler chickens stood \nat 4.08mg for every kilogram of chicken meat produced, \nmeaning a 73% increase compared to 2021. In the \nproduction of pigs, there was a modest increase of 2.83% \nin the use of antibiotics for each kilogram produced. In \nthe production of turkeys, the amount remained stable.\nSASB FB-MP-260A.1\nInnovation in \nsanitary quality \nIn 2022, as part of our maturing process and \nevolution in the Quality System (read more \nhere), we made a series of advances relating \nto the control and monitoring of indicators \nand processes in the production chain.
