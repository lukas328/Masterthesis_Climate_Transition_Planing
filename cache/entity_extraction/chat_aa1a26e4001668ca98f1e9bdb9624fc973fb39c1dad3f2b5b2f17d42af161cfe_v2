This includes emission reductions from the use of green electricity covering 98% of \nour consumption through green tariffs and renewable electricity certificates, but in accordance with the \nGreenhouse Gas Protocol it does not include emissions reduction from the use of carbon credits.\nWe purchased and retired 120,000 carbon removal credits, assured under the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS), \nand Triple Gold certified to the Climate, Community & Biodiversity Alliance Standards (CCBA) to invest beyond our \nvalue chain, and provide benefits to climate, especially those that generate additional co-benefits for people and \nnature(6). By investing beyond our value chain, these carbon credits mitigate direct operational emissions of 73,927 \ntCO2e in 2022, while we continue to decarbonise in line with the SBTi. Further detail of our decarbonisation plans \ncan be found in the transition plan on our website at natwestgroup.com.\nOperational emission reductions are linked to the remuneration of our executive directors. For further information, \nrefer to the Directors’ Remuneration Report within 2022 NatWest Group plc Annual Report and Accounts.\nSupply chain \nWe have used a spend-based approach(9) to estimate our supplier emissions. In late 2022, we established a \n(multi-year) Supplier Decarbonisation Programme to support delivery of the 2030 and 2050 carbon reduction \nambitions related to our operational value chain. This will involve collaborating with our suppliers to understand \ntheir capability, data, where they are on the journey to net zero, and what help they might need to progress.\nWe are also working with a third party to evaluate our supply chain using evidence-based assessments of \nsustainability performance enabling us to understand our wider impact and to identify where improvements can be \nmade, and risks mitigated.\nAs part of increasing the sustainability of our cash and coin operations, we have engaged our suppliers to reduce \nthe amount of single-use plastic coming in and going out of our cash centres and to improve the accuracy of data \nfor our waste streams.\nFor our properties, the suppliers we work with must have environment and quality management accreditations \nand products used in fit-outs should meet all Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors SKA criteria as standard.\nNatWest Group’s own operational footprint5.4\nThe table below presents an update on our climate ambitions related to our own operational footprint.\nOwn operations key performance indicators Target Year Baseline Year 2022 % Target Achieved 2021\nCarbon and Energy\n(RE100)(7) 100% renewable electricity for global operations (% global electricity) 2025 N/A 98% 98% 97%\n50% emissions reduction from direct own operations (% total direct own operation emissions) 2025 2019 -46% 92% -44%\n(EP100) 40% energy productivity improvement (% total energy) 2025 2015 41% 103% 36%\nElectric Vehicles (EV100)\n100% of our fleet vehicles electric (% of fleet converted to electric) 2025 N/A 3% 3%(10) 1%\nInstall EV chargers in 15% of large office spaces across our portfolio (% large office spaces with charging \ninfrastructure) 2025 N/A 13% 87% 11%\nResource Use\nMaintain zero waste to landfill in UK & Republic of Ireland (% waste diverted from landfill) 2025 2019 99.9% 99.9% 99.9%\nWaste diverted from landfill and incineration (UK & Republic of Ireland)(8) 2025 2019 86% 91% 88%\nReduce paper consumption 70% (% paper reduced) 2025 2015 -67% 96% -65%\nThe historic values reported in the table above (and data on page 74 and 75) may be updated from values we reported in 2021.
