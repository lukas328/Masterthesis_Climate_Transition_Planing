� Our key actions following the \n2022 HRA will be: \n• Improving human rights governance structure: we will work on \ncreating better human rights governance at different parts of  \nour value chain � This will ensure salient human rights issues are \nunderstood, recognised, prioritised, and well-managed across  \nour operations �  \n• Rare-Earths Usage Mapping: In 2023, we aim to finalise an \nanalysis of our use of rare earth minerals to further develop our \nrisk frameworks�  \n•  Expanding risk matrix assessment to indirect suppliers: based on \nthe updates conducted on our matrix for sustainability risk for \ndirect suppliers, we aim to implement the same principles for our \nindirect suppliers, who have a separate risk-based approach �\n40\nVestas Sustainability Report 2022\nSocialIn brief General GovernanceEnvironment Sustainability data Appendix\nOur approach\nHuman Rights Policy\nOur commitments\nOur Human Rights policy outlines our commitment to respecting \nhuman rights wherever we are present � Our responsibility to respect \nhuman rights includes supporting the following international \ninstruments in our policy: the UN International Bill of Human Rights, \nILO’s eight fundamental conventions, the UN Guiding Principles on \nBusiness and Human Rights (UNGPs), and the OECD’s Guideline for \nMultinational Enterprises � We have also been a signatory to the UN \nGlobal Compact since 2009 � \nWhere local laws and regulations set lower standards, but do not \nprohibit applying international standards that exceed local laws, we \nabide by international standards �\nWe considered various internal stakeholders when setting the policy, \nand engaged an international consultancy to carry out a review � The \npolicy applies globally and we expect our business relations both \nupstream and downstream to respect human rights within their \nscope� The Human Rights Policy is signed by Vestas’ Board Chair, \nand is publicly available on vestas �com�\nGoverning our Human Rights Policy\nOur Compliance & CSR function oversees the policy and works \nday-to-day to implement it within our internal processes across  \nthe organisation � \nThe commitments in our Human Rights Policy are embedded into \nseveral other policies and processes including our Employee & \nSupplier Codes of Conduct, due diligence processes, our Social Due \nDiligence process on wind farms, and in the assessment of our direct \nand indirect suppliers � \nImplementation is carried out in collaboration with different \nstakeholders across the company at various levels � For example, \nwith Group Sustainability at a strategic level, with Sustainable \nProcurement on a supplier level, and with the legal, sales and \nconstruction teams at the wind farm project level, to name a few �\nCommunication and training\nContinuing to improve the understanding of human rights and how \nwe can have an adverse impact is important to us � We prioritise \nraising awareness of the Human Rights Policy among our employees \nthrough internal communication and training � In 2022, we hosted a \ncompany-wide round-table webinar about human rights manage -\nment at Vestas � For the past three years, on Human Rights Day (10 \nDecember), we have shared a company-wide article and visual \nmaterial to emphasise our commitment to the UNGPs �\nWe also work collaboratively to promote the respect of human rights \nin business � For example, we are a member of the Nordic Business \nNetwork for Human Rights, the UN Global Compact Human Rights \nNetwork, and BSR, a sustainable business network, as well as taking \npart in the annual annual UN Forum on Business and Human Rights �\nLink to the policy: Policies (vestas �com) \n41\nVestas Sustainability

EthicsLine\nEthicsLine is our whistleblower platform that allows our employees \nand partners to report violations of the Vestas Codes of Conduct, \napplicable laws, and Vestas policies and procedures � Since 2007 , \nEthicsLine has helped ensure that such violations are always \nbrought forward and dealt with appropriately � \nThe main purpose of EthicsLine is to provide our employees, \npartners, or anyone associated with the company a place to report \nunethical behaviour or practices observed at work � EthicsLine also \nprovides guidance for employees who may find themselves in an \nethical dilemma � \nThe EthicsLine Policy highlights our zero-tolerance approach to \nretaliation against reporters raising a case in good faith, whether the \nreport is ultimately substantiated or not � The same applies to \nindividuals who cooperate as part of an EthicsLine investigation (for \nexample as witnesses) � \nEthicsLine is hosted on a secure external website where anyone can \nraise a concern without fear of repercussion � The platform allows \nreporters to remain anonymous, except in instances when this would \nbe specifically prohibited by law � Subject to applicable laws, all \nmatters reported through EthicsLine are investigated thoroughly, \nand everyone involved is treated fairly � \nTo support the availability of EthicsLine, the platform is accessible \npublicly on Vestas �com, on the Vestas Compliance app on the App \nStore and Google Store, and internally on our intranet � EthicsLine is \nalso available by phone in the United States � To raise further \nawareness of EthicsLine and how to use it, several training sessions, \ncommunication initiatives, and webinars are conducted across \nVestas� Our training material, which has been translated into several \nlanguages, is available on the Code of Conduct Portal and includes \ntraining slides with anonymised EthicsLine cases � \nAn Ethics Committee supports and supervises\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature":
