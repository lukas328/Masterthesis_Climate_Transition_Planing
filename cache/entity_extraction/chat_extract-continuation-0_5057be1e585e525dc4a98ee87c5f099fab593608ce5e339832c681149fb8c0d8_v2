We \nhave programs such as the Occupational Health Medical \nControl Program, Respiratory Protection and Hearing \nConservation programs, which are geared to ensuring the \nintegrity and wellbeing of our employees. Operation of \nthe Occupational Health Medical Control Program is fully \nintegrated with the Occupational Risk Management Pro-\ngram, observing the agents of physical, chemical, biologi-\ncal, ergonomic and accident-related risks.\nOur employees’ access to medical and health care ser-\nvices that are not related to work is provided, by the BRF \nHealth Care Centers, in the form of a benefits package \nthat includes pregnancy and new-born infants’ health \ncare, vaccination campaigns, changes in lifestyles and a \npartnership with a gym app, amongst other advantages. \nIn addition to this, the Company undertakes prevention \ncampaigns related to sexually transmitted diseases, smok-\ning and alcoholism.\nREAD MORE \non this matter on page 86\nA benchmark in transportation \nsafety\n \nOur entire transport fleet is outsourced and \nequipped with a system designed to control \ndriver fatigue. The Company requires not only \nthat the partner transportation company has \nfull control of this system, but also that they \nprovide access and power to determine what \nwill and will not be tolerated. Drivers involved \nin risky behavior (using a cellular phone whilst \ndriving, for example), may be banned from \nworking for BRF. Actions such as this have \nallowed the Company to achieve the lowest rate \nof transport accident frequency in its history.\nAlso deserving of note is the BRF Safety and \nLogistics Committee, which supervises the \ntransportation not only of our products, but \nalso of personnel and animals. The group \nmeets monthly to share good practices and \nrecommendations in response to accidents and \nincidents.\nAlso worthy of mention is the ‘Dr . BRF’ service, which pro-\nvides medical advice over the telephone, offered free of \ncharge and without limits on its use to all our employees \nand their families. The service is offered 24 hours per day, \nseven days per week, and during the virtual appointments \nthe doctor can prescribe medicines, order exams, monitor \nsymptomatic cases and, whenever necessary, forward the \npatient for treatment at an emergency unit.\nIn 2022, we recorded 248 cases of work-related ill health, \nincluding hearing loss and musculoskeletal illnesses, \nwithout any deaths being registered. BRF monitors and \nsupports all of our employees impacted and is constantly \nreinforcing its controls and management of risks based \nupon these incidents, whilst always seeking to improve \nthe processes to avoid the recurrence of these types \nof health problems. These data refer solely to our own \nemployees, since the Company does not undertake any \ncontrol of occupational illnesses amongst outsourced \nworkers.\n73\nOur strategy\nCulture and \nEngagement\nValue Generation\nIndicators  \nand annex\n3\n4\n5\n6\nOur way of  \ndoing business\n2\n2022 Integrated  \nReport\nPresentation1\nDiversity, equality and \ninclusion\n \nThe values of diversity, multiculturalism and plurality \nare an integral part of our history.
