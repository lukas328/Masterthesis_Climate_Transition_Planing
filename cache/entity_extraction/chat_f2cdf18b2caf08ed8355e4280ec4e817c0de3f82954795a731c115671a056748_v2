Whilst the combined impact \nwould reduce profitability and EBITDA against our latest forecast, our balance sheet remains \nstrong with ample working capital and Net Debt/EBITDA ratios. \nThe group has a robust funding position comprising a range of long-term debt and a £1 billion \nfive year committed revolving credit facility maturing in March 2027 which was entirely \nundrawn at 31st March 2023. There was £521 million of cash held in money market funds \nand £129 million of other cash and bank deposits. Of the existing loans, £151 million of term \ndebt and £4 million of other bank loans mature in the period to June 2024. We assume no \nrefinancing of this debt in our going concern modelling. As a long time, highly rated issuer in \nthe US private placement market and having recently extended its UK Export Financing \nfacility, the group expects to be able to access additional funding in its existing markets if \nrequired but the going concern conclusion is not dependant on such access as the company \nhas sufficient financing and liquidity to fund its obligations in the base and severe-but-\nplausible scenarios. The group also has a number of additional sources of funding available \nincluding uncommitted metal lease facilities that support precious metal funding. Whilst we \nwould fully expect to be able to utilise the metal lease facilities, they are excluded from our \ngoing concern modelling. \nConclusion \nUnder all scenarios above, the group has sufficient headroom against committed facilities and \nkey financial covenants are not in breach during the going concern period. To give further \nassurance on liquidity, we have also undertaken a reverse stress test to identify what \nadditional or alternative scenarios and circumstances would threaten our current financing \narrangements. This shows that we have headroom against a further decline in profitability \nbeyond the severe-but-plausible scenario or a significant increase in borrowings. Furthermore, \nthe group has a range of levers which it could utilise to protect headroom including reducing \ncapital expenditure, renegotiating payment terms and reducing future dividend distributions. \nThe directors are therefore of the opinion that the group has adequate resources to fund its \noperations for the period of at least twelve months following the date of this announcement \nthese financial statements and there are no material uncertainties relating to going concern so \ndetermine that it is appropriate to prepare the accounts on a going concern basis. \nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 2023150\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION\n  \nNotes on the Accounts \nfor the year ended 31st March 2023 \n150 \n1 Accounting policies \nThe Company and the Group \nJohnson Matthey plc (the ‘Company’) is a public company limited by shares incorporated \nunder the Companies Act 2006 and domiciled in England in the United Kingdom. The \nconsolidated accounts of the company for the year ended 31st March 2023 consist of the \naudited consolidation of the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred \nto as the ‘Group’), together with the employee share ownership trust and the group's interest \nin joint ventures and associates. \nBasis of accounting and preparation – group \nThe financial statements of the group have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted \nInternational Accounting Standards and with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 as \napplicable to companies reporting under those standards. \nThe accounts are prepared on the historical cost basis, except for certain assets and liabilities \nwhich are measured at fair value as explained below. \nThe group accounts comprise the accounts of the parent company and its subsidiaries, \nincluding the employee share ownership trust, and include the group's interest in joint \nventures and associates. Entities the group controls are accounted for as subsidiaries. Entities \nthat are joint ventures or associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. \nTransactions and balances between group companies are eliminated. No profit is recognised \non transactions between group companies. \nThe results of businesses acquired or disposed of in the year are consolidated from or up to the \neffective date of acquisition or disposal, respectively. The net assets of businesses acquired are \nrecognised in the consolidated accounts at their fair values at the date of acquisition. \nGoing concern \nThe directors have reviewed a range of scenario forecasts for the group and have reasonable \nexpectation that there are no material uncertainties that cast doubt about the group’s ability to \ncontinue operating for at least twelve months from the date of approving these annual accounts. \nAs at 31st March 2023, the group maintains a strong balance sheet with around £1.6 billion \nof available cash and undrawn committed facilities. Free cash flow was positive in the year \nat £74 million. Net debt at 31st March 2023 was £1,023 million at 1.6 times net debt \n(including post tax pension deficits) to underlying EBITDA which was at the lower end of \nour target range. \nAlthough impacted by the significant headwinds faced in the current macroeconomic \nenvironment such as high inflation, the impacts of Russia’s war with Ukraine and uncertainty \nin outlook for major economies, the group’s performance during the period was resilient, both \nin terms of underlying operating profit and cash flow. For the purposes of assessing going \nconcern, we have revisited our financial projections using the latest forecasts for our base case \nscenario. The base case scenario was stress tested to a severe-but-plausible downside case \nwhich reflects severe recession scenarios. \nThe severe-but-plausible case for Clean Air model\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
