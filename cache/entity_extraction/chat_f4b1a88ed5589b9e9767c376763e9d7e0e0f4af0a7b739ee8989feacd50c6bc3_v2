Depreciation of right-of-use assets is reported \nin Note 4. Interest on lease liabilities is reported within financial expenses (see Note 2.5). \nExtension options \nSome property leases in the Group contain extension options exercisable by the lessee before the end of the non-\ncancellable contract period. The periods covered by extension options are only included in the lease term if the \nlessee is reasonably certain to exercise the options. At lease commencement an assessment is performed of \nwhether it is reasonably certain to exercise the extension options, taking into account factors like the future timing \nof options, economic incentives for the lessee to exercise the option or the lessee's past practice.

Periods covered by a termination option \nare only included in the lease term if the lessee is reasonably certain not to exercise the option. \nAs at 31 December 2022, potential discounted future cash outflows of Â£60m (2021: Â£52m) have not been included \nwithin lease liabilities because it is not reasonably certain that the related termination options will not be exercised. \nFuture lease commitments \nThe Group is committed to leases that have not yet commenced to the value of Â£10m as at 31 December 2022 \n(2021: Â£26m). \nVariable lease payments \nSome leases, predominantly of care home properties in Spain, contain variable lease payments that are based \non earnings. The future potential cash flows arising from variable lease payments not included in the lease liability \nare estimated at Â£23m (2021: Â£14m). \nNote 19: \nProvisions \narising from \ninsurance \ncontracts and \nother liabilities \narising from \ninsurance \nbusiness \nProvisions arising from insurance contracts and other \nliabilities arising from insurance business in brief \nThe provisions arising from insurance contracts and other liabilities \narising from insurance business arise from the Groupâs underwriting \nactivities. The provisions mainly relate to unearned premiums, which are \ndeferred revenues that relate to future periods; and claims, where an \nestimate is made of the expense required to settle existing obligations to \ninsurance customers. The other liabilities primarily consist of obligations \nto repay deposits and commissions payable. \n19.1 Provisions arising from insurance contracts \nProvisions for unearned premiums \nThe unearned premium provision represents premiums written that relate to periods of risk in future accounting \nperiods. It is calculated on a straight-line basis, which is not materially different from a calculation based on the \npattern of incidence of risk. \nIn circumstances where a return of premiums is likely to be due to policyholders, a provision for the return of \npremium is established within the provision for unearned premiums. The return of premium provision is treated \nas an adjustment to the initial premium, reducing gross premium income. A provision for return of premiums \nwas established in 2020 in respect of Bupa Insurance Limited following the commitment to pass back to eligible \ncustomers any exceptional financial benefits experienced by the UK PMI business that ultimately arose as a result \nof the COVID-19 pandemic. As at 31 December 2022, the return of premium provision is estimated to be Â£59m \n(2021: Â£71m). The reduction in the provision reflects a decrease in the best estimate of the exceptional financial \nbenefit to be returned to eligible customers due to a higher rebound of claims. The provision closed to future \naccrual of benefit from 31 December 2021. \nBupa Annual Report 202\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
