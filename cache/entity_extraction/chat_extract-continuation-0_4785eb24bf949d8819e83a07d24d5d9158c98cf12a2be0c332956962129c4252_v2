This is \nsupported by setting regular short-term targets, such as our target1 \nto deliver a 25 per cent reduction in the carbon emissions intensity \nof our investment portfolio by 2025 against our 2019 baseline.\nIn order to meet this ambition, we are focusing on reducing the \nintensity and, ultimately, the absolute amount of financed emissions \nin respect of our investments. We use the weighted average carbon \nintensity (WACI) as a metric that allows us to compare progress in \nemissions intensity improvements on different portfolios. We use \nthe WACI as a proxy for the transition risk in our investment portfolio: \na higher WACI typically indicates that an investment portfolio has \nto transition more extensively to align with the Paris Agreement.  \nAs a data user, we are at the end of the data value chain, using \ndata disclosed by investees to calculate our WACI through \nreporting frameworks such as the TCFD recommendations and \nCDP. As discussed in the Financial Stability Board’s 2022 TCFD \nstatus report2, which describes the global state of alignment of \ncompanies’ reporting with the TCFD recommendations, the \nTCFD-aligned reporting by region is notably lower across Asia and \nAfrica, ie the regions where we operate. Data availability therefore \nremains an ongoing challenge. We continue to work with data \nproviders and our asset managers to improve the availability of \ndata. An increase in data coverage may have the impact of either \nraising or lowering the WACI of our investment portfolio if the profile \nof the new companies’ data is different to those already included in \nthe current coverage. We expect such limitations to be overcome \nas more climate disclosures occur in these regions, potentially \nusing established frameworks such as the TCFD or the \nanticipated standards from the International Sustainability \nStandards Board (ISSB).\nWe anticipate that our WACI reduction progress will be driven \nby different activities throughout our portfolio decarbonisation \njourney, taking place across the following phases (figure 3): \n1  Implementation of our responsible investment policy, including \ncoal divestment and the implementation of WACI budgets to a \nnumber of our equity strategies;\n2  Engagement and education with our investee companies as well \nas with other public and private stakeholders, both bilaterally and \nthrough collaborative mechanisms;\n3  Decarbonisation by investee companies executing their \ndecarbonisation strategies; and\n4  Broader changes that occur as part of the whole economy \ntransition, both at a local and international level.\nTo date, the WACI of our investment portfolio has declined by \n43 per cent compared with our 2019 baseline. The decline to date \nhas been driven largely by the implementation of our coal policy, \ncarbon intensity reductions made by our underlying investee \ncompanies, and the implementation of WACI budgets to a \nnumber of our equity strategies. \nHowever, we believe more lasting real-world impact can be achieved \nthrough financing the transition and engagement, rather than simply \nchanging the portfolio to optimise our investment portfolio carbon \nfootprint. Therefore, we do not anticipate that our portfolio \ndecarbonisation will continue at the same pace going forward. \nIn collaboration with our asset management and asset owner \nbusinesses, we continue to develop further climate-related \nmetrics. During 2022, we reviewed peers’ practice and industry \nrecommendations regarding forward-looking metrics, such as \nClimate Value at Risk (C-VAR) and implied temperature risk (ITR). \nWe have identified that these metrics are appropriate for internal \nuse, although they have limitations surrounding data availability – \nparticularly in the markets in which we operate and invest in – and \nthe level of assumptions they require. We will continue to develop \nour internal understanding of these new metrics, while considering \ndisclosing them externally, once these shortcomings can be \nappropriately overcome or mitigated.\n1
