We also carried out the \ngroundwork to help our investment teams make more \ncomprehensive assessments of nature-related risks \nand impacts, which will be a focus this year. \nOver the last three years, we have vigorously \nadvocated for the finance industry to focus on \nreal-world emissions reduction, rather than simply \nportfolio emissions reduction. This was again a \npriority in the reporting period. We remain concerned \nthat the drive to decarbonise portfolios will result in \ncapital flowing out of emerging markets and sectors \nthat need transition investment. We strongly believe \nthat unless we help fund the transition in emerging \nmarkets, there will be no hope of keeping global \nwarming below 1.5 oC. A just transition is essential \nin both developing and developed countries: we \nmust deal fairly with the people displaced by the \ntransition, or progress towards a clean-energy \nfuture will be slowed by socio-political headwinds. \nIn December 2023, we supported the launch of the \nAbu Dhabi Global Climate Finance Centre (“GCFC”), \nwhich is fully aligned with these imperatives, as a \nfounding member. \nTo support broader industry progress towards net \nzero, a common understanding of what transition \ninvestment entails is needed. To this end, we \nagain worked in the past year with the Sustainable \nMarkets Initiative (“SMI”) and Glasgow Financial \nAlliance for Net Zero (“GFANZ”). \nLastly, we continued to address our own emissions. \nThe biggest contributor to our Scope 1 and 2 \nemissions is the electricity consumption of our \nCape Town office. To mitigate this, we are engaging \nwith our landlord and the local municipality to set \nup the first virtual power purchase agreement over \na municipal grid in South Africa, facilitating the \nprocurement of green power for our Cape Town \npremises. We hope this arrangement can serve as \na model for others to follow. \nYear in review: driving positive change\n6\nSustainability and Stewardship Report\nOur approach  \nto sustainability \nWe believe that integrating sustainability into investment decision-making can \nlead to better financial outcomes for our clients. For the bulk of our strategies, \nthis involves identifying, understanding and integrating the material sustainability \nrisks and opportunities within the investment process – and seeking to \nengage to mitigate these risks where possible. In addition, we have developed \nsustainable strategies (see page 26) that explicitly seek to invest behind the \ntailwinds that we believe key sustainability themes will provide for relevant \ncompanies and countries.\nWe believe that this approach gives us the best opportunity to have a positive \nreal-world impact while delivering our core responsibility of maximising value for \nour investors. To complement this approach, we seek to contribute to the global \npolicy agenda, where relevant, through our advocacy and to act sustainably \nwithin our own business.\nOur sustainability framework has three pillars – Invest , Advocate and Inhabit  – \nunderpinned by six principles.\nEndeavour to identify, \nunderstand and \nintegrate material \nsustainability risks and \nopportunities within the \ninvestment process.\nFulfil stewardship and \nfiduciary duties to \nstakeholders, including \nexercising ownership \nrights responsibly.\nDevelop investment \nsolutions that focus on \naddressing sustainability \nchallenges and the \nenergy transition.\nInvest\nPlay our part in \naccelerating the \ntransition to a more \nsustainable future by \ncontributing to the \nglobal policy agenda \nand development of \nindustry standards.\nAdvocate\nLook to act \nsustainably and aim \nto run our business \nresponsibly.\nInhabit\nDisclose how we discharge our sustainability \nresponsibilities through publicly available policies \nand reporting.\nInvest | Advocate | Inhabit\nOur sustainability principles\nOur approach to sustainability within our investments is governed \nby our Sustainability Policy  and our Stewardship Policy and Proxy \nVoting Guidelines .\n7\nSustainability and Stewardship Report\nHighlights, key figures\nand significant \ndevelopments \nSustainability highlights\nSustainability and Stewardship Report\nInvest\nAll investments carry the risk of capital loss and past performance does not predict future returns.\nDelivering on our transition plan and targets\nImproving transparency and disclosure\nBuilding sustainability-focused products and tools\nDeveloped new analytical frameworks\nto assess companies for diversity, \nequity and inclusion and Just Transition\nDeveloped an\nEmerging Markets Transition Debt Strategy\nwhich launched in April 2024\nScience Based Targets initiative (“SBTi”) \ncommitments or targets approved\n10.9%\nFinanced \nemissions\n26.6%\nCorporate  \nAUM\nCompleted Transition Plan Assessments\n44\nto evaluate progress of our top \nemitters towards delivering ambitious \nand credible transition plans\nAdded new scenario-analysis tools\nto enhance our ability to assess climate risks\nto further develop sustainable investing expertise\nOpened ‘Transition School’ for Ninety One \ninvestment teams\n98%\nat the 2023 annual \ngeneral meeting (“AGM”)\nShareholder support for our transition plan\nSubmitted our second full CDP report\n4 & 5 stars\nacross all \napplicable modules\nAchieved PRI Assessment scores between\nMaintained signatory status to the \nFRC UK Stewardship Code\nAssets managed\nsustainable equity and \nmulti-asset strategies*\n£4.3billion\nsustainable fixed income \nand infrastructure*\n£1.0billion\n*As at 31 March 2024.\nImplemented UK’s Task Force on Climate-\nrelated Financial Disclosures (TCFD)\nproduct\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
