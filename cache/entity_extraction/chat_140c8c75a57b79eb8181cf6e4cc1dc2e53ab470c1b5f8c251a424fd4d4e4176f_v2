The key \nassumptions vary by CGU and include the \ndiscount rate and the forecast cash flows, \nincluding the terminal growth rate. \nWe identified four CGUs as having a higher risk \nof impairment, namely Bupa Dental Care UK, \nBupa Care Services, Bupa Villages and Aged \nCare Australia and Bupa Chile and the valuation \nof the goodwill and intangible assets in these \nCGUs was an area of audit focus. As disclosed \nin Note 3 of the financial statements, significant \nimpairments have been recognised in all four \nCGUs. \n▪ Bupa Dental Care UK – Goodwill £191m (2021: \n£467m), impairment loss recognised to \nGoodwill of £274m, to other intangible assets \nof £255m; and to other tangible assets of \n£117m; \n▪ Bupa Care Services – Goodwill £nil (2021: \n£90m), impairment loss recognised to \nGoodwill of £90m; \n▪ Bupa Chile – Goodwill £nil (2021: £130m), \nimpairment loss recognised to Goodwill of \n£139m and to intangible assets of £22m; and \n▪ Bupa Villages and Aged Care Australia– \nGoodwill £nil (2021: £99m), impairment \nloss recognised to Goodwill of £103m. \nFor three of the CGUs, there is no identified \ngoodwill remaining following the impairment \ntesting performed, therefore, the valuation \nuncertainty is reduced, although there continues \nto be inherent uncertainty in estimating and \ndiscounting the cash flow projections. \nFor the Bupa Dental Care UK goodwill, \nthe inherent uncertainty in estimating and \ndiscounting the cash flow projections means \nthere is a range of potential outcomes \ngreater than our materiality from plausible \nalternative assumptions. \nAllocation of impairment in Bupa Dental \nCare UK CGU \nFor the Bupa Dental Care UK CGU, the \nmethodology and assumptions applied in \nperforming the impairment assessment and \nsubsequent allocation of the impairment \nbetween goodwill, intangible assets and \ntangible assets, is inherently complex. \nFor goodwill and intangible asset impairment, \nwe performed the following procedures over \nmanagement’s impairment assessments: \nDiscount rates \n▪ Used our valuation experts to assess the \nappropriateness of management’s methodology \nfor computing the Weighted Average Cost of \nCapital used for discounting projected cash \nflows in the Value in Use calculations, including \nthe change to using a spot rate approach. \n▪ Used our valuation experts to independently \ndetermine a reasonable range for the CGU \ndiscount rates, using external comparable \nmarket information where possible. Assessed \nwhether the rates used by management were \nwithin our reasonable range. \nModel integrity \n▪ Verified the discounted cash flow models, \nincluding validating the numerical accuracy of \nthe models and the application of the discount \nrates. \nCash flows \n▪ Agreed cash flow forecasts to internal \nsupporting documentation, including approved \nBusiness Plans. \n▪ Compared cash flow forecasts used in the \nreview to historical performance and \nchallenged management where forecasts \nindicated performance that deviated \nsignificantly from historical performance. \n▪ Challenged key assumptions in the cash flow \nprojections, including expected occupancy \nrates in care homes, care minute rates in \nAustralian care homes, dental clinician hours \nand retention rates and the terminal growth \nrates applied, and obtained supporting internal \nor external information. \n▪ Performed sensitivity analyses on the key \nassumptions. \nAllocation of impairment \n▪ Assessed whether the methodology to allocate \nthe impairment within Bupa Dental Care UK to \nthe related goodwill, intangible and tangible \nassets was in accordance with IAS 36, \nImpairment of assets. \n▪ Verified the application of the methodology and \nassessed whether the assumptions applied were \nreasonable. \nDisclosure \n▪ Assessed the appropriateness of the relevant \ndisclosures to confirm compliance with the \napplicable financial reporting standards. \nBased on the procedures performed and the \nevidence obtained, we consider that the \nimpairment losses recognised were appropriate \nand the remaining valuation of goodwill in these \nCGUs is reasonable. \nBupa Annual Report 2022 110 \n  \n  \n  \n \n   \n \n \n   \n  \n  \n     \n    \n   \n        \n       \n          \n    \n   \n   \n  \n      \n       \n   \n     \n     \n  \n   \n  \n    \n       \n      \n       \n       \n      \n       \n    \n         \n        \n        \n       \n       \n      \n     \n        \n      \n  \n      \n      \n  \n      \n        \n      \n    \n   \n    \n     \n     \n     \n  \n     \n       \n    \n     \n    \n       \n      \n    \n  \n     \n        \n     \n    \n      \n    \n      \n      \n  \n     \n      \n     \n   \n      \n     \n      \n    \n       \n       \n      \n         \n          \n      \n      \n   \nStrategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements \nIndependent auditors’ report to the members of \nThe British United Provident Association Limited \ncontinued \nKey audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter \nValuation of \nprovisions arising \nfrom insurance \ncontracts \n(Group) \nRefer to Audit \nCommittee \nReport, and \nNote 19.1 (for \naccounting policy \nand financial \ndisclosures) \nProvisions arising from insurance contracts \ncomprise provisions for unearned premiums \nand provisions for claims. \nWe consider the valuation of the provisions for \nclaims, including the deferred claims liability in \nAustralia as a key area of audit focus given the \nmagnitude and inherent uncertainty involved \nin this estimate. \nProvisions for claims \n£1,264m (2021: £1,093m) \nThe calculation of the outstanding claims \nprovision is based on certain key assumptions\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
