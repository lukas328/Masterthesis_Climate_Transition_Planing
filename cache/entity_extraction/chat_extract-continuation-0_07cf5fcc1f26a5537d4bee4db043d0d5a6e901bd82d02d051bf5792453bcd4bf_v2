Guidance on Metrics, Targets, and Transition Plans , October 2021.\nCONTENTS  |  FINANCIAL INSTITUTION NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLANS — FUNDAMENTALS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND GUIDANCE\n18\nDISCLOSURE\nWhile the focus of this framework is on developing \nand implementing transition plans, an important \npart of the commitment that financial institutions \nhave made through their sector-specific alliances \nis disclosure. Financial institutions themselves \nare beginning to make such disclosures on a \nvoluntary basis and should continue to do so \nfollowing guidance and requirements from various \ndomestic and international bodies. This guidance \nis not focused on disclosure, but GFANZ believes \nfinancial institutions should be transparent \nabout key elements of their transition plan in a \nclear, consistent, and comparable way. GFANZ \nrecommends that financial institutions disclose \ntheir net-zero transition plans, including interim \ntargets, to stakeholders and disclose progress \nagainst their plans with their climate disclosures  \nat least annually.\nEach financial institution should determine specific \ncontent, location, and frequency for disclosing \nthe components of its transition plan, consistent \nwith the requirements of their respective sector-\nspecific alliances and jurisdictional requirements, \nif any. When preparing disclosure, institutions \nshould consider the TCFD’s Principles for Effective \nDisclosures. An organization should indicate how \nits transition plan forms part of its response to \nclimate-related risks and opportunities previously \nidentified through TCFD reporting, and the residual \nrisk to the organization from incorporating the \nactions outlined in the transition plan.\n67 For the purposes of this report, “financed emissions” or “portfolio emissions” include those associated with a financial institution’s \ninvestment, lending, and underwriting portfolios, or from clients of investment consultants or financial service providers.\n68 CDP found that financed emissions could be 700 times greater than a financial institution’s own operational emissions .\n69 PCAF. GHG Protocol Chapter 15 . Also, The Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the Financial Industry .\n70 This report uses “financed emissions” and “portfolio emissions” interchangeably.\n71 GFANZ encourages the use of the PCAF Standards, built on and accepted by the GHG Inventory Protocol, Category 15, and \nacknowledges their ongoing work to further develop and refine methodological guidance to measure and disclose GHG emissions \nassociated with different asset classes and categories of financial activity and for financial institutions to utilize these standards, \nas appropriate, as they are released (e.g., at the time of writing, PCAF is working on insured emissions and capital market \ninstruments  methodologies).\nDEFINING THE SCOPE OF EMISSIONS \nCOVERED BY THESE RECOMMENDATIONS\nThis report covers financial institutions’ Scope 3 \nfinanced emissions 67 consistent with the sector-\nspecific net-zero alliance commitments. Scope 3 \nmethodologies are still evolving, including in the \nfinancial sectors where the same real-economy \nemissions can be counted multiple times in \nthe investment chain. The concept of financed \nemissions, especially relevant for banks and \nasset owners, is complemented by other evolving \napproaches appropriate to asset managers, \ninsurers, service providers, and other financial \nservices actors. \nFinancial institutions will have a much greater \nimpact on global GHG emissions by targeting \nthe reduction of their financed GHG emissions, \nwhich are significantly larger than their operational \nemissions.68 These emissions include those \nassociated with a financial institution’s investment, \nlending, and underwriting portfolios, or from  \nclients of investment consultants or financial  \nservice providers. 69, 70, 71\nAs shown in Figure 4, financial institutions’ net-zero \ncommitments should cover at least the Scope 1 \nand Scope 2 emissions associated with clients or \nportfolio companies. They should also cover Scope \n3 emissions associated with clients or portfolio \ncompanies in sectors that are significant climate \nchange contributors or where company Scope 3 \nemissions are material and can be incorporated \nCONTENTS  |  FINANCIAL INSTITUTION NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLANS — FUNDAMENTALS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND GUIDANCE\n19\nbased on data availability.72 While this report does \nnot cover emissions from a financial institution’s \nown operations, such as supply chains or employee \n72 Greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, should be considered within GHG metrics and targets \n(see Appendix 2 in the Financial Institution Net-zero Transition Plans — Supplemental Information report).\ntravel, GFANZ recommends that all scopes of \nGHG emissions should be actively managed \nand disclosed.\nFigure 4.
