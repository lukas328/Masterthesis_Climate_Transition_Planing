Our Commitment to Fly Net Zero by 2050 , October 4, 2021.\n219 SBTi. Science-Based Target Setting for the Aviation Sector , version 1.0, August 2021.\nRMI’s Center for Climate-Aligned Finance is partnering with six banks that are active in the aviation sector with  \nthe goal of helping decarbonize the sector. 217 \nGHG emissions from aviation are considered hard to abate, and to achieve net-zero aviation emissions by 2050, \nthe sector will require more efficient aircraft, new aviation technology, and sustainable aviation fuels. 218 The SBTi \nestimated in its Aviation Guidance 219 that the sector needs to reduce its carbon intensity by 35% to 40% between \n2019 and 2035, and by 65% between 2019 and 2050. The six banks acknowledged that “the financial sector will \nplay a crucial role in funding the technologies, projects, and companies involved in this net-zero transition.”\nIn April 2022, the banks announced the Aviation Climate-Aligned Finance Working Group, which aspires to \ncollectively define common goals for action for aviation sector decarbonization before the end of 2022.  \nFinancial institutions participating in a framework being developed would agree to annually assess and disclose \nthe degree to which the GHG from the aircraft, airlines, and lessors that they finance are in line with 1.5 degrees C \nclimate targets.\nThis effort shows how engagement in cross-sector initiatives in the real economy may help to accelerate \nthe managed phaseout of high-emitting assets and rollout of transition infrastructure, and to seek common \napproaches or frameworks to support comparability, driving further momentum and accountability. \nThe six banks aim to create consistency and transparency in reporting and measuring progress to climate  \ntargets. Financial institutions using the climate-aligned framework will be able to assess the emissions of their \naviation loan books, and work with their clients to report their emissions, fund lower-carbon solutions, and support \ninvestments in new technologies. The intent is to design the framework for rapid adoption by aviation financiers \nglobally. The working group will invite other financial institutions to adopt the climate-aligned finance framework \nby the end of 2022.\n \nENGAGEMENT STRATEGY\nCONTENTS  |  FINANCIAL INSTITUTION NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLANS — FUNDAMENTALS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND GUIDANCE\n73\n220 A sia Investor Group on Climate Change (AIGCC), Investor Group on Climate Change (IGCC), Principles for Responsible \nInvestment (PRI).\n221 I nvestor Agenda, Investor Climate Action Plans (ICAPs) Expectations Ladder , May 2021.\n222 CRF.
