In 2019, 25% AUA \nin the portfolio was exposed to \nhigh transition risk sectors, which \naccounted for 89% of overall listed \nequity and credit emissions (figures 9 \nand  10). \nIn 2021 the exposure to high transition risk sectors \n(energy, utilities, materials and industrial) had \ndropped to 20%, which accounted for 71% of \noverall listed equity and credit emissions. This was \nprimarily due to a reduction in absolute carbon \nemissions from the utilities sector, driven by a fall in \npower demand during the global pandemic. The \nproportion of our listed equity and credit portfolio \nexposed to the fossil fuel industry was 8% ^ at 2021 \nyear-end.\n1 Sectors that are vulnerable in a transition to a net zero economy. \n Size up exposure continued \nListed equity and credit assets\nOur listed equity and credit emissions are \nconcentrated with our top 10 emitting \ncounterparties, which account for 5% of AUA, but \n33% of listed equity and credit emissions (figure 11). \nOn a geographic basis, the majority of the absolute \nemissions in our listed asset portfolio is from \ninvestee companies based in Europe (60%), \nfollowed by North America (25%) and Asia (11%) \n(figure 12).\nThis concentration of transition risk helps us to \nunderstand where to best focus our investee \ncompany engagement and policy advocacy \nby sector and by geography. We detail our \nstewardship approach on pages 34–37.\nAs at 2021, almost half of our listed asset portfolio  \nis invested in counterparties that have committed \nto set or have already set approved science-based \ntargets (‘SBTs’) that are consistent with the goals \nof the Paris Agreement (see figure 13). \nThe metric is based on whether an investee \ncompany has affiliated itself to the SBTi, either by \ncommitting to and being in the process of setting \nSBTs, or by already having approved SBTs.  \nWe have seen a 20% increase from 2019 to 2021  \nin companies having either approved SBTs (15%  \nto 32%) or committed to SBTs (13% to 16%).
