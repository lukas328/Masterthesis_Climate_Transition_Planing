Energy consumption in kWh for Scope 1 and Scope 2. Global includes UK GHG emissions. Numbers may not total exactly due to rounding. \nSustainability and Stewardship Report\n69\nOur carbon footprint was calculated in accordance with the \ninternational Greenhouse Gas (“GHG”) Protocol’s Corporate \nAccounting and Reporting Standard (revised edition). \nWe measure and report our carbon using both location- and \nmarket-based methodologies. We believe this provides the most \ntransparent and accurate view of our operational carbon footprint.\nKey carbon numbers\nAs an investment manager, the largest contribution to our carbon \nfootprint is from the investments that we make on behalf of \nour clients. At the same time, in line with our purpose, we want \nto contribute to a better world, and aim to run our business \nsustainably. We are committed to reducing emissions across our \nown operations and locations. \nIn financial year 2024, our Scope 1 and 2 emissions increased by \n3%. However, compared with 2019, our baseline year, our Scope 1 \nand 2 emissions have decreased by 25%, and we remain on track \nfor our 2030 target. \nTotal tCO2e per £million of adjusted \noperating revenue, our intensity \nmetric, increased by 37%.\nGlobal Scope 2 electricity emissions \nincreased by 1% on a location basis.\nOver half of our Scope 2 emissions relate to \nour Southern Africa offices, a more carbon-\nintensive location for electricity. \nOur global Scope 3 emissions, which include \npaper, waste and business travel, increased \nby 45% to 6,694 tCO2e. \nThis was mostly due to changes in the greenhouse gas \nconversion factors applied to travel, with some \nincrease in business travel (specifically air travel). A \ncertain amount of travel is required to run our global \nbusiness, both to meet with clients and engage with \ncolleagues. However, we continue to look at less \nemissions intensive options for air travel. This will be a \nfocus over the coming period. \nSustainability and Stewardship Report\n70\nWhile decarbonising our operations remains our focus, we \nmaintained our long-term partnership with BioCarbon Partners \n(“BCP”) to mitigate 100% of our Scope 1, 2 and 3 (business \ntravel) carbon emissions. BCP is a for-profit social enterprise \nfounded in 2011, working to make forests and wildlife valuable to \nrural communities in the Luangwa and Lower Zambezi areas of \nZambia. BCP does so primarily through the development and sale \nof carbon offsets, generating revenue used to conserve natural \nforests in some of Africa’s most important ecosystems. The projects \nare deeply integrated into local communities, which share in the \nrevenue from the sale of the verified carbon offsets.\nWe continue to assess viable options for sourcing energy from \nrenewables. This remains a challenge in South Africa, where we \nhave sizeable operations. Nevertheless, we continue to seek to \nimprove our energy efficiency. This has included entering into an \nagreement with Growthpoint Properties to wheel renewable solar \nenergy from the Constantia Village shopping centre in the suburbs \nof Cape Town for use at Ninety One’s refurbished offices once the \nrefurbishment is complete. This will significantly improve the carbon \nfootprint of this office. \nOur employee resource group, Ninety One Green, continued \nlooking at how to implement sustainability initiatives across \nthe business. We maintained our partnership with Giki Zero to \nengage and educate our employees on their carbon footprints. \nThis included campaigns on COP28 and explaining what it \nmeans for individuals rather than corporates and governments. \n7171\nSustainability and Stewardship Report\nSustainability and Stewardship Report\n71\nAs part of our Corporate Social Investment (“CSI”), \nwe work with communities to create a lasting positive \nimpact in the societies in which we live and work. \nWe support initiatives that our staff feel passionate \nabout and where they can be actively involved. \nThe majority of our CSI efforts continue to be directed \ntowards towards education and skills development \nin South Africa, where the relative need is greatest. \n21.  Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment.\nSustainability and Stewardship Report\n72\nEducation\nA multi-faceted approach is required to improve education and skills \ndevelopment outcomes. Recognising this, we support initiatives \naddressing different challenges and age groups. We spent more than \n£2 million on education and skills development initiatives globally \nin the reporting period, primarily directed at addressing the high \nunemployment and skills deficit that South Africa faces.\nOur focus areas in South Africa remain guided by the \noverlap of our CSI pillars (education, conservation and \ncommunity development) and the regional imperative \nof transformation as expressed in B-B\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NINETY ONE<|><organization><|>Ninety One is an investment management firm that measures and reports its carbon footprint, commits to sustainability initiatives, and partners with organizations like BioCarbon Partners to mitigate emissions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIOCARBON PARTNERS<|><organization><|>BioCarbon Partners is a social enterprise founded in 2011 in Zambia, working to conserve forests and wildlife by developing and selling carbon offsets, and sharing revenue with local communities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GROWTHPOINT PROPERTIES<|><organization><|>Growthpoint Properties is a real estate company that has entered into an agreement to supply renewable solar energy to Ninety One’s offices in Cape Town)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GIKI ZERO<|><organization><|>Giki Zero is an organization that partners with Ninety One to educate employees about their carbon footprints and promote sustainability initiatives)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COP28<|><event><|>COP28 is an international climate conference where discussions on climate action and sustainability are held, relevant to Ninety One’s environmental initiatives)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOUTH AFRICA<|><geo><|>South Africa is a country where Ninety One has significant operations, faces energy challenges, and focuses on community development and education initiatives)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ZAMBIA<|><geo><|>Zambia is a country where BioCarbon Partners operates projects to conserve forests and wildlife, and where Ninety One collaborates to mitigate carbon emissions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAPE TOWN<|><geo><|>Cape Town is a city in South Africa where Ninety One’s offices are located and where renewable energy projects are implemented)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUA ZAMBEZI<|><geo><|>Luangwa and Lower Zambezi are regions in Zambia where BioCarbon Partners develops conservation projects involving local communities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GROWTHPOINT PROPERTIES<|><organization><|>Growthpoint Properties is a real estate company that supplies renewable solar energy to Ninety One’s offices in Cape Town)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NINETY ONE<|>BIOCARBON PARTNERS<|>Ninety One partners with BioCarbon Partners to mitigate 100% of its Scope 1, 2, and 3 carbon emissions<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NINETY ONE<|>GROWTHPOINT PROPERTIES<|>Growthpoint Properties supplies renewable solar energy to Ninety One’s offices in Cape Town<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NINETY ONE<|>GIKI ZERO<|>Giki Zero collaborates with Ninety One to educate employees on their carbon footprints<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NINETY ONE<|>COP28<|>Ninety One engages with COP28 discussions on climate and sustainability<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIOCARBON PARTNERS<|>ZAMBIA<|>BioCarbon Partners operates conservation projects in Zambia involving local communities<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NINETY ONE<|>SOUTH AFRICA<|>Ninety One operates in South Africa, focusing on energy efficiency and community development<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NINETY ONE<|>CAPE TOWN<|>Ninety One’s offices in Cape Town are involved in renewable energy projects<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
