It also requires management to exercise judgement \nin applying the Group’s accounting policies. \nThe areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or where estimates are significant to the \nConsolidated Financial Statements, are set out below.

Other intangible assets are tested for impairment when there are indicators \nassets of impairment. \nSources of estimation uncertainty \nImpairment tests include a number of sources of estimation uncertainty as the key assumptions used when modelling \nthe recoverable amount require estimating the discount rate, terminal growth rate and the forecast cash flows. \nEstimation uncertainties within these cash flows vary by CGU. For aged care these include occupancy rates, fee rates, \nstaff and agency costs and operating expenses; for provision business, available clinician hours, fee rates and \noperating expenses; and for insurance business, future insurance premium rises, claims volatility and claims inflation. \nKey estimation uncertainty in the period has been driven by economic volatility including the associated inflationary \npressures across Bupa's key markets. This has primarily impacted the determination of appropriate discount rates. In \naddition, there is increased uncertainty in the underlying cash flow forecasts driven by this economic uncertainty. \nAccounting judgements \nJudgement has been applied to determine whether there are indications of impairment to intangible assets. In making \nthis judgement, the Group has considered current trading and future plans associated with each of the assets in order \nto assess whether a full impairment assessment is required. Judgement has also been applied in the methodology used \nfor allocating impairment across assets within the related CGU. \nProperty \nvaluations \nThe Group has a significant portfolio of care home, hospital and office properties. These are subject to periodic and at \nleast triennial valuations performed by external independent valuers, with directors’ valuations performed in \nintervening years. In addition, the Group has a significant portfolio of investment properties, primarily retirement \nvillages in New Zealand. These properties are revalued annually. \n4,5 \nSources of estimation uncertainty \nSignificant assumptions for freehold property are normalised earnings, average occupancy and capitalisation rates, \nwhereas for investment property key assumptions are discount and capital growth rates. \nAccounting judgements \nIn valuing care home property, a judgement is made on the highest and best use of the property. In the majority of \ncases this leads to the property being valued as part of a group of assets making up a going concern business using \nmarket-based assumptions. The business is valued on a fair maintainable trade basis with the fair value thus calculated \nbeing allocated to plant and equipment and bed licences where applicable at net book value (as a proxy for fair value), \nwith the residual value being allocated to property. \nDefined \nbenefit \nThe Group’s principal defined benefit scheme is in the UK, The Bupa Pension Scheme. The scheme closed to future \naccrual as at 31 December 2020. \n7 \npension \nobligations Sources of estimation uncertainty \nExternal actuarial advice has been taken in setting the assumptions used in the valuation of the defined benefit \npension obligations, which are the discount rate, rates of inflation, salary increases and mortality. As defined benefit \nschemes are long-term in nature these assumptions can be subject to uncertainty. In particular, inflation assumptions \nare term dependent and, due to recent increases in inflation, will reflect higher inflation expectations in the near term \nfollowed by an assumed fall back to more average rates over the longer term. \nClaims \nprovisioning \nUnearned \npremium \nprovisioning \nProvisions \nand \ncontingent \nliability \nEstimates included in the provisions arising from insurance contracts include expected claims payments and expenses \nrequired to settle existing insurance contract obligations. \nA deferred claim provision continues to be held within the outstanding claims provision in respect of the health \ninsurance business in Australia,\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
