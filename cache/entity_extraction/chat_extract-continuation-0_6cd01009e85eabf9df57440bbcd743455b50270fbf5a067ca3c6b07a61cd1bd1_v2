PCAF’s ratings assign directly collected customer \nemissions data a better score while estimated or extrapolated data achieves lower scoring. A PCAF score of 1 is typically considered to have a very low margin of error for estimation of financed emissions, while a PCAF \nscore of 5 is typically considered to have a much larger margin of error. Data limitations mean that sectors are generally foot-printed using a mixture of customer-specific emissions and estimated data. \nThe table shows the percentage of exposures in each sector for which (a) externally published emissions and production data has been used; (b) revenue estimates have been used; or (c) extrapolation has been applied to estimate \nemissions, and related data quality scores. Data quality scores vary across sectors based on source of data as well as level of estimation required.\n2021 2019\nSystem Sector\nPublished emissions \n/ Production data \n(%) Data
