Key estimates are made in relation \nto the assumptions used in calculating discounted cash \nflow projections to value the CGUs containing goodwill, \nto value other intangible assets not yet being amortised, \nand to value other assets when there are indications that \nthey may be impaired. The key assumptions are \nmanagement’s estimates of budgets and plans for how the \nrelevant businesses will develop or how the relevant assets \nwill be used in the future, as well as discount rates and \nlong-term average growth rates for each CGU.\nWe reviewed a report from management explaining the methodology used, assumptions made and significant changes from \nthose used in prior years. In light of the current volatile macroeconomic environment, including high inflation, interest rates \nand increased energy costs, management considered impact within underlying forecasts and discount rates. \nWe challenged management on the rationale behind the key assumptions and sensitivities such as discount rates and growth \nrates in the goodwill value in use calculations, especially within Clean Air and Catalyst Technologies to ensure we were satisfied \non their reasonableness.\nThe impairment reviews were an area of focus for PwC who reported their findings to us. \nWe concluded that management’s key assumptions and disclosures are reasonable and appropriate.\nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 202398\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION\nAudit Committee Report continued\nSignificant current year considerations in relation to the accounts Work undertaken/outcome\nRefining process and stock takes\nWhen agreeing commercial terms with customers and \nestablishing process loss provisions, key estimates are \nmade of the amount of precious metal that may be lost \nduring the refining and fabrication processes. Refining \nstocktakes involve key estimates regarding the volumes \nof precious metal-bearing material in the refining system \nand the subsequent sampling and assaying to assess the \nprecious metal content.\nWe received a report from management which summarises the results of the material refinery stock takes. The report \nwas reviewed to ensure that the results were in line with expectations and historic trends.\nThe refining process and stock takes were an area of focus for PwC who reported their findings to us.\nWe concluded that management’s accounting for refining stock take gains and losses was in accordance with the agreed \nmethodology.\nPost-employment benefits\nKey estimates are made in relation to the assumptions \nused to value post-employment benefit obligations, \nincluding the discount rate and inflation.\nThe key assumptions are based on recommendations from \nindependent qualified actuaries.\nWe received a report from management which summarises the key assumptions used to value the liabilities of the main \npost-employment benefit plans. The assumptions were compared with those made by other companies and PwC’s assessment \nof the reasonableness of the assumptions was considered.\nWe concluded that the assumptions used, and accounting treatment, are appropriate for the group’s post-employment benefit \nplans.\nTax provisions\nKey estimates are made in determining the tax charge \nin the accounts where the precise impact of tax laws and \nregulations is unclear.\nWe received a report from management which explains the issues in dispute, or at risk of this, with tax authorities across the \nbusiness, the calculation of tax provisions and relevant disclosures. We also considered the sensitivities around the provisions \nand debated the circumstances in arriving at the key provisions.\nTax provisioning was an area of focus for PwC who reported their findings to us.\nWe concluded that management’s key assumptions and disclosures are reasonable and appropriate.\nClimate change\nKey estimates are made in relation to climate change and \nthe impact on the going concern period and viability of the \nperiod over the next three years. Additionally, the potential \nimpact of climate on the financial statements including \nforecasts of cash flows used in impairment assessments, \nrecoverability of deferred tax assets and expected lives \nof fixed assets and their exposure to the physical risk posed \nby climate change.\nWe received a report from management which summarises the potential impacts of climate change to the business. This was \nbased on a Zurich insurers report commissioned in 2021/22. Management has considered the impact of climate change in \ntheir goodwill impairment calculations and going concern/viability forecasts.\nWe concluded that management’s key assumptions and disclosures are reasonable and appropriate.\nWe also received a report outlining how TCFD considerations are factored into the financial statements.\nProvisions and contingent liabilities (judgement)\nKey estimates are made in determining provisions in the \naccounts for disputes and claims which\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
