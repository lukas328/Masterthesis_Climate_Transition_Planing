BRF has a very intense creation \nprocess, or in other words, the animals are farmed \nin installations without access to external areas, or , \nsubsequently, to grazing. The exception to this is in \nSadia’s organic line, which differs in that the poultry \nhave access to an external area, following organic \nfarming standards.\n98\nValue Generation5\nOur way of \ndoing business\nOur strategy\nCulture and \nEngagement\nIndicators  \nand annex\n3\n4\n6\n2\nPresentation1\n2022 Integrated  \nReport\n100% of our fertile egg producing poultry \nare cage free with access to a nest, \na necessary structure for the animals to \nbe able to express their natural behavior.\nPoultry SASB-FB-MP-410a.2\nSpace for movement: We stipulate a maximum density \nfor the housing of poultry (both in our own installations \nand in those of our integrated partners) of 39 kg/m², in \nline with European directives, considered to be one of the \nbest in the world. Around 52% of broiler chickens farmed \nby BRF globally are slaughtered with a density of less than \n30 kg/m².\nCage free: 100% of the fertile egg production centers are \ncage free with access to a nest, a necessary structure for \nthe animals to be able to express their natural behavior . \nBRF does not produce eggs for sale, something which \noccurs only in the case of infertile eggs. Whatever the \ncase, all eggs that do come to be sold are classified as \ncage free. \nFeeding: broiler chickens have free access to water and \nfeed prepared by nutritionists according to the needs of \neach phase of the animal’s development.\nCorrect temperature: we maintain conditions of \nthermal comfort for the animals through the use of \nspecial equipment, and the maximum and minimum \ntemperatures and humidities of the installations are \nrecorded every day for control and monitoring purposes.\nRest time: we respect a minimum of 8 hours of light per \nday and four hours of dark, thus following the day/night \nrhythm and the proper light intensity for each phase of \nthe animal, in each farming system.\nBeak trimming: we use laser equipment (instead of a \ncutting and cauterizing system) on 100% of our turkeys, \nas well as on the broiler chicken breeding hens, whilst \nrespecting the limit of removing a maximum of 1/3 of the \nupper beak, with this being performed just once in an \nanimal’s life.\nRespect for regional criteria: we also respect the \nspecific cultural, religious and market demands of our \nclients and certifications.\nCage-free turkeys: no turkey farmed by BRF globally is \nconfined in a cage, meaning all of them enjoy freedom of \nmovement within the installation.\nFattening turkeys: around 87% of the animal fattening \nprocesses are performed in a system of conventional \nhousing, with open curtains thus making maximum use \nof natural light.
