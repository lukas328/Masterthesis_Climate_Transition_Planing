The Mission \nZero: Independent Review of Net Zero Report, published in January 2023, details various opportunities available to \nthe UK to support the transition. \nAs a purpose-led organisation, we aim to continue to work with our customers and partners to develop products, \nservices and partnerships to support the transition to net zero for us, our customers and the UK.\nHowever, we and our customers have a dependency on timely and appropriate government policies to \nprovide the necessary impetus for technology development and customer behaviour changes to enable the \nUKâs successful transition to net zero. We have used the UK CCCâs sixth carbon budget to assess the impacts \nof, and the extent of the dependency on, government policies within the initial iteration of our climate transition \nplan. The UK CCCâs Progress in reducing emissions: 2022 Report to Parliament noted significant risks and currently \ninsufficient plans in the Buildings and, Agriculture and Land Use, sectors and some risks for other key sectors. We \nhave factored these risks into our transition plan and plan to continue our proactive work on policy engagement \nwith government. Refer to Page 49 for our approach to UK Government policy engagement. These policy risks, if \nnot adequately addressed in a timely manner, put at risk the UKâs net zero transition and in turn that of our \ncustomers and ultimately our own.\nThe table below includes the following for each sector analysed within the initial iteration of the climate transition \nplan as at 31 December 2021 (i) estimated absolute emissions (ii) estimated physical emissions intensities (iii) \nEstimated physical emissions intensity based on convergence points aligned to external scenarios and (iv) \ncomparison of expected and latest estimated physical emissions intensities.\nRefer to section 3.4. 3.5, 5.5 and 5.7 for further details.\n2021\nSystem Sector Scope 1 and 2 (MtCO2e) Scope 3 (MtCO2e) Physical emissions intensity(1) Convergence point Difference %(2) RAG\nProperty\nResidential mortgages  3.1  â 37.8 kgCO2e/m2 35 kgCO2e/m2 7%\nCommercial real estate  0.3  â 56.6 kgCO2e/m2 53.6 kgCO2e/m2 5%\nConstruction  0.6  â 43.4 tCO2e/Â£m 37.3 tCO2e/Â£m 14%\nMobility\nAutomotive manufacturing   0.5 250.0 gCO2e/v-km 243 gCO2e/v-km 3%\nLand transport and logistics    \nOf which freight road  0.1  0.2 45.9 gCO2e/t-km 35.5 gCO2e/t-km 23%\nOf which passenger rail  0.2  0.1 59.4 gCO2e/p-km 46.8 gCO2e/p-km 21%\nOf which passenger road  0.2  0.2 86.9 gCO2e/p-km 61.2 gCO2e/p-km 29%\nEnergy\nElectricity generation  0.5  â 116.7 kgCO2e/MWh 174 kgCO2e/MWh (49)%\nOil and gas\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
