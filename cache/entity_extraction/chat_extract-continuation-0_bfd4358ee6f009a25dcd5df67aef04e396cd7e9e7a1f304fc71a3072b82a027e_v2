We are aligned with key frameworks that define \nhuman rights principles for businesses, including UN Guiding Principles on Business and \nHuman Rights and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) \nGuidelines for Multinational Enterprises. \nModern Slavery Statement\nWe are committed to ensuring no modern slavery exists in our business and to \nidentify, mitigate and remediate any issues we find in our value chain. We publish our \nModern Slavery Statement annually to demonstrate our progress.\n Full statement: matthey.com/modern-slavery\nEnsuring high ethical standards \nWe are playing to win in the right way – which means holding ourselves to the highest ethical \nstandards in everything we do. This year, we focused on supporting a culture which goes \nbeyond technical legal compliance to include every employee taking accountability for \nbehaving ethically and making good decisions in our everyday work. \nOur ethical culture is led from the top by our Board and GLT. An example of this was our \nannual Ethics Week, where our CEO shared a personal example of how he handled an ethical \ndilemma during his career. It was a powerful demonstration of his commitment to doing \nthe right thing, even in challenging circumstances. Where instances of serious misconduct \nare revealed, our Board strongly supports exiting those individuals from our organisation \n– no matter their level of seniority or the short-term disruption it might cause. \nMore than 50 sites took part in our annual Ethics Week celebrations. This year the theme \nwas collaboration between senior leaders, site managers and Ethics Ambassadors to generate \nPeople: Promoting a safe, diverse and equitable society continued\nWe are a signatory to the UN Global Compact  \nand remain committed to its principles and aims.  \nAs part of our membership, this year we took part in \nthe UN’s Business & Human Rights Accelerator training \nprogramme to build upon our internal knowledge.  \nWe published our first UNGP Annual report to \n“Comprehensive” standard in December 2022\n UNGP Annual Report: matthey.com/UNGP-progress\nWe have the potential to positively impact billions of lives around the world. The benefits of \nJohnson Matthey should not only be felt by our customers, but by everyone that comes into \ncontact with our business.\nThis year we published our first standalone human rights policy. It highlights a core group \nof rights which we believe we impact the most as an organisation and that we have the \npotential to positively address. It has been reviewed by external specialists to ensure that it \nmeets best practice principles and has been signed off by the Board. \n View our Human Rights Policy: matthey.com/human-rights-policy\nOur approach to human rights considers our entire value chain – including our own \noperations, suppliers and customers. We have set ourselves an ambitious commitment to \nassess all of our value chain partners for human rights risks by 2030. To make that happen, \nwe developed a tailored human rights risk assessment framework in 2021/22 in partnership \nwith KPMG and which we have begun to roll out across our own operations and supply \nchain this year.\nFor our own operations\nThis process identified five high-risk countries where we have operating sites. After applying \nour assessment to several sites in these countries, we are in the process of raising concerns \nwith local teams and putting remedial actions in place where required.\nFor our suppliers\nWe identified 100 key suppliers that accounted for 22% of our annual procurement spend \n(excluding PGMs). These suppliers were assessed using our human rights risk framework and \nthose identified as higher risk went through enhanced due diligence using third party \nservices. Where required, mitigations and remedial actions have been put in place and \ncontinued monitoring has been implemented. Key issues identified with higher-risk suppliers \nhave been escalated to our human rights steering group, consisting of relevant senior leaders. \nHuman rights awareness formed part of our annual Code of Ethics training offered to all eligible \nemployees. Additional, targeted awareness and training sessions on human rights and conflict \nminerals were made available to our relevant staff throughout the year. \nOur independent Speak Up helpline is available for anyone wishing to raise a human \nrights concern. \n See page 42 for more information on our Speak Up culture\nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 202338\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTSOTHER INFORMATION\nSustainability continued\nOur industry-leading ethical culture heatmap\nThis year we continued to embed the ethical culture heatmap tool we launched \nin 2021/22.
