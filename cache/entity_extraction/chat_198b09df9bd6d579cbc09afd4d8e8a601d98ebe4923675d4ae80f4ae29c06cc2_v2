The net-\nzero transition plan should represent the strategic \nalignment of a financial institution’s core business \nand build upon, but look beyond, an institution’s \nown risk profile to support the net-zero transition  \nin the real economy.\nAs seen in Figure 5, net-zero transition planning  \nwill be informed by firms’ efforts to identify \nclimate-related risks and opportunities, in particular \ntransition risks. Transition risks include a broad \nrange of risks, including the possibility that high-\nemitting assets or activities will lose value or \nbe stranded in a low-carbon future, as well as \nnew risks stemming from the scaling of climate \nsolution technologies and processes.

Carried out globally, actions \naligned with the net-zero transition aim to mitigate \nfuture physical impacts from climate change by \nlimiting projected warming.  \n \n \nWhile adaptation financing is not designed to \ndecarbonize the real economy, financial institutions \nshould consider pursuing opportunities where \nmitigation and adaptation efforts are closely \nlinked and support both sets of objectives. At a \nminimum, mitigation efforts should be reviewed \nfor unintended consequences that impede \nadaptation efforts.\nCONTENTS  |  FINANCIAL INSTITUTION NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLANS — FUNDAMENTALS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND GUIDANCE\n21\nWorking with our partners\nThe recommendations and guidance in this report \nare pan-sector and aim to be broadly applicable to \nall types of financial institutions. This report is built \non the invaluable industry-specific knowledge and \nexpertise of the financial sector-specific net-zero \nalliances that comprise GFANZ. The alliances have \nproduced resources and guidance on the net-zero \ntransition targeted to their members’ specific \nbusiness models and regulatory constraints. The \nalliances’ guidance — covering target setting, \ntransition planning, and related efforts — though \ntailored to their specific industries, contributes \nimmeasurably to the creation of a clear path \nforward that is vital to mobilizing the entire \nfinancial sector and reducing fragmentation.  \nThis report is intended to be complementary \nto, rather than supersede, industry-specific \nresources already in use by alliance members. \nThe recommendations and guidance herein aim \nto encourage greater consistency, ambition, and \ncomparability across the financial sector. The \nguidance in this report can be used in many ways, \ndepending on the financial institution type and \nmaturity of its net-zero transition. \nFor financial institutions in alliances that have not \nyet developed an overarching transition planning \nframework, this report provides such a framework, \nalongside more targeted guidance on specific \ncomponents from the net-zero alliance(s). For \nfinancial institutions that have already developed \ntransition plans based on alliance guidance, this \nreport provides additional details or examples on \nindividual components.  \nGFANZ encourages financial institutions to use \nthe recommendations, guidance, and case studies \nin this report alongside the guidance produced \nby their relevant net-zero alliance(s). Financial \ninstitutions should look to their net-zero alliance \nwhen considering how this framework can be \napplied to support implementation of their net-  \nzero commitment\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
