LGIM’s policy on thermal coal, oil sands, and deforestation\nSub-sector: Asset  Management\nLegal and General Investment Management (LGIM), one of the world’s largest asset managers, has set a 2030 \ntarget for 70% of its eligible investments to be managed in line with achieving net-zero carbon emissions by \n2050.177 Where possible, LGIM has implemented its policies and conditions with features including: \n• a clear objective connected to net zero;  \n• definition of the sectors and activities to which the policy applies; \n• details of any restrictions or exclusions that apply;\n• relevant timelines;  and\n• transparency.\nLaunched in 2016, the Climate Impact Pledge 178 is LGIM’s targeted campaign to address the issue of climate \nchange. Since 2020, LGIM has expanded its assessment 179 to include around 1,000 companies in 15 climate-critical \nsectors, responsible for more than half of GHG emissions from the world’s largest publicly listed companies. \nIMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY\nCONTENTS  |  FINANCIAL INSTITUTION NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLANS — FUNDAMENTALS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND GUIDANCE\n59\nA key pillar in the assessment framework is scenario analysis, which includes the comparison of a company’s \nemissions reduction efforts against the sectoral pathways necessary to be in line with the Paris Agreement. Under \nthe Pledge, those targeted companies that are not meeting LGIM’s minimum expectations around climate change \nmay face a voting sanction. In other words, LGIM, on behalf of its clients, may vote against these companies, if \nappropriate, or ultimately, remove them from selected funds. 180 \nMore broadly, LGIM’s commitments include a specific policy related to thermal coal and oil sands 181 as well as \ncommitments to address agricultural deforestation and work with clients to set decarbonization goals and develop \ninvestment solutions to support  them.\nThermal coal   \nLGIM has:182 \n180 Companies are divested from selected funds with £87 billion in assets (LGIM, as of December 31, 2021), including funds in the \nFuture World fund range and all auto-enrollment default funds in L&G Workplace Pensions and the L&G Mastertrust. Companies \nare divested up to a prespecified limit for funds that track market indices; if this limit is reached, holdings are reduced rather than \nfully divested.\n181 Oil sands are sands that contain bitumen deposits.

This includes \nan assessment of the level of traceability of forest risk commodities (tradeable goods that come from \ntropical forest ecosystems) across its supply chain, and the percentage of commodities purchased under no \ndeforestation principles;\n• sanctioned companies in the Food and Apparel sectors that do not have a deforestation policy with sufficient \ncoverage (e.g., for beef, cattle, and soy); and\n• committed to strive to eliminate agricultural commodity-driven deforestation from its investment portfolios.\nIMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY\nCONTENTS  |  FINANCIAL INSTITUTION NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLANS — FUNDAMENTALS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND GUIDANCE\n61\nTHEME\nEngagement Strategy\nGiven their roles as trusted providers of capital, insurance, and other financial services, or as owners of \ncompanies, institutions in the financial sector can support the transition to net zero by engaging with a \nwide range of stakeholders.
