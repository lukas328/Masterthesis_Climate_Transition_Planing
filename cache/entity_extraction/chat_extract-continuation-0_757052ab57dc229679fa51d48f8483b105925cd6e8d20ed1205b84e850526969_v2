Exposure is based on loans, loan commitments and contingent obligations. As per Risk Management section 4.2, the heightened \nclimate-related risk methodology was updated in 2022 to enable a more granular review of climate-related risk. Through this methodology, 47 subsectors within 17 wholesale sectors have been categorised as being exposed to \nheightened climate-related risk, as shown in the table below. Risk impacts associated with the residential mortgage portfolio are discussed in detail in sections 4.2 and 5.2, and exposure is consolidated below for completeness.
