Any material \nchanges to the policies are also reviewed and approved by the Sustainability Committee. \nWe have largely taken assurance for internal purposes of our stewardship activities to \ndate. The Sustainability Committee’s remit covers the continued enhancement and \nmanagement of Ninety One’s stewardship position and oversees the implementation \nand effectiveness of the related policies. This includes tracking active-ownership activity \n(voting and engagement) and assessing any disputes, outcomes and learning experiences \nthat may enrich the stewardship policy. Over the reporting period, the Sustainability \nCommittee provided a means to discuss and challenge sustainability-related processes, \nwhich has contributed to improvements in accountability and knowledge sharing. \nIn addition, we have received external assurance of the controls covering our proxy-\nvoting process, which have been reviewed in recent years by KPMG and PWC from \nfinancial year 2024, as part of the internal controls report (AAF 01/06). As outlined in the \nESG Integration and Investments sections of this report, the Sustainability Committee and \nInvestment Risk team challenge and regularly review the progress that investment teams \nare making in terms of ESG integration and highlight areas for improvement.\nISS, the proxy-research and vote-execution service provider we use, and other third-party \nproviders are overseen by our Third Party Oversight committee, which meets quarterly. \nThe ISS service is reviewed from a performance and risk perspective. On an annual basis, \nwe collect and review various information from ISS, including its annual internal controls \nreport and insurance certificate, and require the completion of our Information Security \nquestionnaire.\n88\nSustainability and Stewardship Report\nPrinciple Ninety One’s activities \n5. Signatories review \ntheir policies, assure their \nprocesses and assess \nthe effectiveness of \ntheir activities (continued).\nThe continuous review of stewardship and ESG-related activity and the accountability to \nvarious senior committees have led to the improvement of policies and processes over \ntime. We understand that higher levels of assurance provide greater confidence that \nreported information and data are reliable, and so we will continue to discuss how we can \nbetter assure our processes. \nEven as we see companies increasingly report on ESG and sustainability, there is \ncontinuing fragmentation around the world in terms of which standards and frameworks \nare used. However, with the launch of ISSB standards, we expect that there will be \ngreater consistency of reporting which will allow for more effective assurance. We \nhave commenced engagement with an external assurer for its internal review of our \nsustainability reporting, as part of preparation for external assurance in the future, but we \nwill not obtain external assurance for the March 2024 year-end.\nOur marketing-compliance team has reviewed this report to make sure that it is clear, \nfair and balanced. Ninety One’s Chief Executive Officer, Hendrik du Toit, has reviewed \nthe 2024 Sustainability and Stewardship Report, ensuring alignment with the outcomes \nreported to the Sustainability Committee, while ensuring fair, balanced and clear \nreporting.\n6.

The \nmajority of holdings are held with a multi-year time horizon in mind. The time horizon \nover which we expect to meet performance objectives varies across strategies and are \ndetailed in the relevant prospectus.\nResponding to clients’ needs \nWe regularly engage with our clients to understand their needs and stewardship \npreferences, directly one-to-one and through larger information-gathering initiatives. \nOver the reporting period, we carried out our ‘Planetary Pulse’ survey to ascertain \ninvestor and client views on sustainability (please refer to page 55).\nClient-management teams work with our clients to identify their requirements, including \ntheir stewardship and responsible-investing needs. This dialogue has highlighted a strong \ndesire among asset owners to invest in strategies that can make a positive contribution to \nsociety and/or the environment. In response, we have widened our range of impact and \nsustainable strategies (detailed in the Invest section). \nOur clients have varied ESG preferences and our client-management teams work closely \nwith the sustainability and investment teams to review and process these to ensure clients \nESG expectations and requirements are understood and met. \nTo help our clients understand the issues that are impacting their investments, we report \non our responsible-investing activities in multiple ways, including via our Sustainability \nand Stewardship Report, PRI report, TCFD report, quarterly portfolio-level sustainability \nreports, the annual impact and sustainability reports of our sustainability funds, and online \nvote disclosure. We currently produce around 30 standard portfolio-level reports per \nquarter and annual reports for our Global Environment, UK Sustainable Equity, Global \nSustainable Equity and Emerging Markets Sustainable Equity strategies.\n89\nSustainability and Stewardship Report\nPrinciple Ninety One’s activities \n6.
