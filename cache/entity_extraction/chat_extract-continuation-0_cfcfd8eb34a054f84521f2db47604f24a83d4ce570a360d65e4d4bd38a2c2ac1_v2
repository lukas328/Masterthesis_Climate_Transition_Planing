Our ‘grain to glass’ \nsustainability ambition is enabled by \nall stakeholders & groups, from our \nown employees to our customers & \nconsumers. Fundamentally important is \nour work to understand and improve the \nnatural environment. We are using our \nclimate goals to extend our influence and \nsupport the societal shift needed to fight \nclimate change.\nSupply Chain\nEnabling emission reductions across our \nsupply chain (90% of total value chain \nfootprint) is especially important to reach \nthe shared net zero goal. We are targeting \nopportunities that decarbonise the \nmaterials we buy, and the products and \nservices we source, to lower the carbon \nemissions of our brand value chains.\nWe are building strong alliances \nand collaborations, forming long \nlasting partnerships with our suppliers,               \nzco-investing where necessary, to join us \non this journey. This essential engagement \nunderpins the target to reduce scope 3 \nemissions by 50% by 2030.\nIn 2021 Diageo successfully piloted                     \na significantly lower carbon footprint glass \nbottle produced for one of our Scotch Whisky \nbrands. We produced 173,000 bottles with \n100% recycled glass, using waste-based \nbiofuel-powered furnaces – reducing the \ncarbon footprint of glass bottle by up to 90%.    \nLooking to 2030, we will continue innovating, \nto re-think the way we produce and package \nour products to minimise their impact.\n8\nSupply Chain \nCASE STUDY\n9\nSupply\nChain\nAround 30,000 direct suppliers from more than \n100 countries provide us with the materials, \nexpertise, and other resources that help us \nmake our great brands. Many of those direct \nsuppliers themselves have an extensive supply \nchain, connecting us with thousands more \nfarmers and businesses.\nWe can make a significant impact by rethinking \nour way of doing business to embed a more \ncollaborative & circular way we source the \nmaterials & services that we rely on. The \nfollowing principles will enable us to deliver \ntransformative ways of working across our \nsupply chain.\nAccelerate \nDecarbonisation \nwith Suppliers\nWorking with suppliers \nacross a spectrum of \nopportunities to help \nreduce carbon intensity \nof materials, services and \nproducts\nAlternative \nFormats\nThrough changing raw \nmaterials, packaging \nmaterials, increasing \nrecycled content & \nshipping differently\nNew Business Models\nThrough maximising re-use \n& refill opportunities and \nlocal bottling & dispense \nsystems\nResponsible Sourcing\nIntegrating a high level of social \nand environmental standards into \nour supply chains to enable shared \noutcomes\nReduction Initiatives\nThrough practices like light weighting \npackaging, designing out waste              \n& making our business more efficient\nH2\nPartnering with Our \nSuppliers & Third Parties\nWe welcome new thinking to advance a world that \nprotects and restores our natural resources, and we \nwant to collaborate with our suppliers to innovate \nand decarbonise. Our emissions targets form part \nof our Partnering with Suppliers standard and are \nreflected in our sustainable procurement practices.\nTo accelerate action and collaboration in this \narea, we are sharing some of the sustainability \nchallenges we are facing through our Diageo \nSustainable Solutions programme. To find out more \nabout the disruptive solutions or breakthrough \ntechnologies that are helping us on this platform \nclick here.\nWe actively encourage our suppliers to participate \nin emissions reporting through our membership \nof the CDP Supply Chain programme. We are \nalso developing webinars, toolkits and training \nprogrammes for our suppliers to build capability \nthat will help drive further emissions reductions.\n30%\n10\nRaw Material Emissions\nEmissions from the production and processing of \nour raw materials contribute almost a third to our \ntotal value chain footprint. To reduce emissions \nassociated with raw materials we will:\n• Reduce the amount of resources being used by \ncutting down in-field emissions through more \nefficient and regenerative farming practices, \nreducing waste through circular models, and \nimproving production conversion efficiencies\n• Support farmers on the transition to regenerative \nagriculture - developing programmes to deliver \nnature-positive outcomes for soil, water and \nbiodiversity, and improving resilience of farmers’ \nlivelihoods to climate change\n• Improve supply chain traceability and \ntransparency – how raw material selection can \nimprove system resilience and identifying wider \nimpacts using tools like life cycle assessment & \nsourcing studies\n• Partner with suppliers to accelerate innovation \n& step changes in emission reduction – pioneer \ntechnology & collaborations, identifying suitable \nraw material changes & integrating insetting \nopportunities into our supply chain\nPackaging Material Emissions\nMaking the packaging materials we use to enclose, \nprotect and transport our products contributes \none third to our total value chain footprint. Our \nstrategy to become Sustainable by Design outlines \nour packaging ambition & key targets. To reduce \nemissions associated with our packaging, we aim \nto:\n• Reduce the amount of packaging material used \n– by eliminating unnecessary packaging & light-\nweighting materials\n• Select materials for a better reuse / recycling \noutcome – by choosing lower carbon \nmaterials, with higher recycled content, \nimproved recyclability that enable circular                  \npackaging & re-use.\n• Accelerating key packaging decarbonisation \nopportunities directly partnering & co-investing \nwith suppliers and producers\n• Drive innovations in low-carbon packaging – by \ncollaborating with suppliers & key stakeholders   \nto expedite novel opportunities across supply \nchain\nDistribution & Logistics\nUpstream transport & logistics, including distribution \nof products to our customers, contributes 9% to \nour total value chain emissions\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
