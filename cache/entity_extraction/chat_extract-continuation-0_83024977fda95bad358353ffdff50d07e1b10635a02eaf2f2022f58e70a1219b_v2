The ‘BRF Garage’ is the project re-\nsponsible for encouraging entrepreneurship within the \nCompany involving the participation of multi-functional \nleaders. Amongst the initiatives developed as part of \nthe BRF Garage, the one which stands out the most is \nthe ‘Innovation Scouts’ program, by means of which we \ndrive our culture of innovation and propose new busi-\nness models amongst our internal stakeholders. \nCreated just four years ago, this initiative has already \nserved as a platform for around 2,000 ideas, which can \nbe put forward as proposals following analysis  which \nconsiders both adherence to the Company's objectives \nand implementation viability. Those responsible for \nthe three best ideas each year receive a cash award, as \nwell as the opportunity to present their business plan \nand possible prototypes to the BRF Board. They then \nparticipate in a business design workshop offered in \npartnership with a teaching institution, which assists \nthem in developing their business plan.\nAfter just three years of existence,, the BRF Hub \nhas already established 570 connections with \nstartups. Over the course of four years of the \n‘Innovations Scouts’ program, for example, we \nhave collected around 2,000 innovative ideas \nfrom our employees.\n2022 Integrated  \nReport\nOur way of  \ndoing business\nOur strategy\nCulture and \nEngagement\nValue Generation\nIndicators  \nand annex\n3\n4\n5\n6\n2\nPresentation1\n42\nPortfolio and brand\nWe are aware of the need to quickly and reliably introduce \ninnovations that meet the needs of our consumers in \nBrazil and elsewhere in the world. Our innovation agenda \nis guided by research into trends, monitoring changing \nhabits, and studies at our Innovation Center . \nIn 2022, we restructured our innovation processes, with \nthe aim of strengthening the ties between the areas \nresponsible for brands and categories and the teams \nworking on research and development, structuring them \naround the concept of ‘Growth Office’. As part of this work, \nwe have taken a closer look at our portfolio, aiming to \ncombine our customers’ preferences with concrete and \nmeasurable market share results and the margin/share of \nthe innovation products in the Company's results.\nThe central aims of this work were to increase the con-\ntribution of innovations to BRF’s results and more effec-\ntively allocate funds to projects that firmly establish our \nbusiness vision. In 2022, we raised R$ 30 million through \nthis streamlining; at the same time, we directed our \ninnovation efforts to the core business, in categories and \nplatforms where we have already consolidated our po-\nsition and on innovative fronts where we have a greater \nperspective for growth.\nWe launched 106 innovations in 2022. We have increased \nour investments in the processed foods category, which \nrepresents a significant portion of our business, and start-\ned to once again offer products such as the Sadia brand \nbulk sausages, consolidating our position with this brand \nin both Brazil and the rest of the world. \nWe have invested in a study for the development of prod-\nucts in the 'hot bowls’ line, following a consumer trend \nobserved in different markets, focused on convenience \nand practicality, without the need to transfer the food \nonto a plate after defrosting and preparation. In 2022, \nfollowing the launch of ‘Mac ‘n’ Cheese’ in 2020, which has \nseen good results ever since, we made preparations to \nlaunch the hot bowls line in Carbonara, Baby Meatballs, \nBroccoli and Bacon flavors - which entered the market at \nthe beginning of 2023.\nAlso in 2020, we introduced the Sadia Bio brand’s ‘Assa \nFácil’ line of chicken joints, combining aspects of sustain-\nability/traceability and certifications with convenient pack-\naging that can go straight into the oven, without needing \nto be defrosted. The Bio line is focused on a sustainability \nproduction line, with 15 producer families responsible \nfor the rearing of animals fed on 100% vegetable feed, \nwithout use of antibiotics or performance enhancers, \nwhilst adhering to best practices of animal welfare, with \ninternational certification from Certified Humane® and \nWQS®. Another differential is the ability to track the entire \nproduction chain by means of a QR Code on the label of \neach product and the line’s website. \nWe have also relaunched traditional products, using \nintelligent management that aims to draw results from \nour different brands. At Perdigão, we are working hard \nwith special fresh cuts, ‘Our Menu’ ready meals, with \nportions designed for two people, and fresh sausages, de-\nsigned for special situations such as barbecues. We also \nlaunched the ‘Chester Pie’ in chicken with sausage and \ncheddar , and chicken with leek and olive flavors. \nOur attention to the international markets was another \nhighlight. In the Halal markets we launched pre-marinat-\ned chicken breast in cubes, with spices adapted to the \nlocal culture and habits. We have also invested in mar-\nketing cuts such as individually frozen and spiced chicken \nbreasts, and processed foods, such as nuggets - in line \nwith our strategy to double our share in aggregated value \nproducts in the Halal markets within three years.\nR$ 30 million\n raised\nthrough the streamlining of our \nportfolio in 2022\n2022 Integrated  \nReport\nOur way of  \ndoing business\nOur strategy\nCulture and \nEngagement\nValue Generation\nIndicators  \nand annex\n3\n4\n5\n6\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BRF GARAGE<|><|>ORGANIZATION<|>The BRF Garage is a project within the company aimed at encouraging entrepreneurship among employees by developing initiatives like the 'Innovation Scouts' program to foster innovation and new business models.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>INNOVATION SCOUTS<|><|>ORGANIZATION<|>The 'Innovation Scouts' program is an initiative developed by BRF Garage to drive a culture of innovation, collect ideas from employees, and support new business proposals through workshops and awards.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>BRF HUB<|><|>ORGANIZATION<|>The BRF Hub is an internal platform that has established connections with startups to foster innovation and collaboration, with 570 connections formed over four years.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMPANY<|><|>ORGANIZATION<|>The company implementing the BRF Garage and Innovation Scouts initiatives, focused on food production, innovation, and market expansion.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>2022<|><|>EVENT<|>The year during which BRF launched 106 innovations, restructured its innovation processes, and raised R$30 million to streamline its portfolio.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>BRAZIL<|><|>GEO<|>Brazil is a primary market for BRF, where it offers processed foods and brands like Sadia, and is a key focus for product launches and market strategies.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTERNATIONAL MARKETS<|><|>GEO<|>BRF's international markets include Halal markets and other regions where it launches products like pre-marinated chicken and processed foods to expand its global presence.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>SADIA<|><|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sadia is a brand under BRF, known for processed foods such as bulk sausages, ready meals, and innovative product lines like 'Assa Fácil' and 'hot bowls', with a focus on sustainability and convenience.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>PERDIGÃO<|><|>ORGANIZATION<|>Perdigão is a BRF brand specializing in fresh cuts, ready meals, and traditional products, with efforts to relaunch and innovate its product offerings for domestic and international markets.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>HALAL MARKETS<|><|>GEO<|>Halal markets are international regions where BRF has launched spiced and marinated chicken products, aiming to double its share in value-added products within three years.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>INNOVATION CENTER<|><|>ORGANIZATION<|>The BRF Innovation Center conducts research into market trends, monitors changing habits, and supports the development of new products aligned with consumer preferences.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>CULTURE OF INNOVATION<|><|>EVENT<|>The ongoing effort within BRF to foster a culture of innovation through programs like Innovation Scouts and structured processes to develop new business models.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUSINESS DESIGN WORKSHOP<|><|>EVENT<|>A workshop offered to top idea proposers, helping them develop their business plans and prototypes, often in partnership with educational institutions.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>GROWTH OFFICE<|><|>ORGANIZATION<|>The restructuring of BRF's innovation processes around the 'Growth Office' aims to better connect research, development, and brand teams to enhance innovation impact.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>STARTUPS<|><|>ORGANIZATION<|>Startups are external innovative companies that BRF has connected with through the BRF Hub to foster collaboration and new business opportunities.)##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
