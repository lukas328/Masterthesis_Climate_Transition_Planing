The flood analysis presented is based on \npresent day risk levels which take into account the \nprobability of flood events occurring. This analysis \ncovers c.97% of the UK mortgage portfolio.\nOn a total volume basis, present day UK mortgages at \nhigh risk of flooding are 2.9% of the portfolio and those \nat very high risk are 0.1% of the portfolio. This is \ncomparable to the overall UK volume-based analysis \nwith high of 3.0% and very high of 0.1%.\nData for flood risk analysis: Flood risk data is \nobtained through our third-party vendor, Airbus, and \ntheir flood risk analysis includes surface flooding, \nrivers, ground water as well as coastal flooding and \nclay-related shrink-swell. Airbus gathers multiple \ngeospatial datasets, derived from industry specialists \nincluding Ordnance Survey, JBA Risk Management \nand Property Risk Inspection. It also calculates the \nphysical risks to properties now and as global \ntemperatures rise using climate data from the UK \nClimate Projections 2018.\nFlood scores: JBA model flood hazard by looking \nat the four different types of flooding (surface water, \nground water, coastal and river) and calculating the \nfrequency and depth of flooding nationally to derive \nflood maps. Flood defences are considered where \navailable. Flood scores are allocated per property \nbased on the potential flood damage to property \ndependent on the type, frequency and depth of \nflooding modelled across different return periods. \nThe scoring ranges from 0 to 53, with 0 being lowest \nand 53 being the highest risk. We consider a score \nof 11 and above to be high risk and properties with \na score of 31 and above within the very high risk \ncategory after flood mitigants are taken into account. \nJBA’s flood scores in the UK are widely used by \ninsurers, lenders, property search/conveyancers \nand valuation surveyors, providing a consistent \nview across the whole homebuying and property \nmanagement process.\nUK residential mortgages – energy efficiency and flood risk assessment continued\n(*) Within the scope of EY assurance.
