We are working towards achieving our portfolio \nalignment targets, described in section 3.3, by: \n • Designing our Net Zero Investment Framework, which uses qualitative and quantitative data sourced from \nfund managers to assess the credibility of their net-zero strategy, related commitments and progress made \nagainst these. This complements our carbon reduction targets by identifying datapoints that we consider to be \nindicators for future decarbonisation.\n • Embedding our net-zero ambition into our core investment products, by building a minimum allocation to \nassets that are already on a net-zero trajectory into the fund prospectus.\n • Leveraging our strategic relationship with BlackRock to build average annual decarbonisation into our \nCoutts ESG Insights funds, and developing a net-zero approach for our active Coutts funds.\n • Building net zero into our engagement activity with companies and funds and demonstrating our net zero \nambition through our voting activity.\nExternal dependencies to support transition:\n • As an investor in third-party funds, we are dependent on the asset management industry to design products \nthat are aligned to net zero and have sufficient scale.\n • Voting and engagement is most effective if the asset management industry is moving jointly in the same \ndirection. This requires consensus on engagement priorities and collaboration to set out standards and \nexpectations around net zero.\n • As a global investor we need decarbonisation to happen on a global scale rather than in isolated geographic \nsegments, therefore requiring not only national policy action, but supranational cooperation and global \nconsensus around how net zero will be achieved. \n(1) Lending exposure to Financial institutions excluding Reverse Repurchase agreements and other short term lending.\n45NatWest Group plc | 2022 Climate-related Disclosures Report\nGovernance Strategy and Climate transition plan Risk Management and Scenario Analysis Metrics and TargetsIntroduction\nSupporting Germany’s first five-year \ngreen bond syndication\nNatWest Markets facilitating responsible financing\nIn August 2022, the Federal Republic of Germany issued its first \nsyndicated five-year green bond.\nFollowing NatWest Markets lead managing the UK’s first green \nbond, it was mandated by Germany’s Finanzagentur – the central \nservice provider for the Federal Republic of Germany’s borrowing \nand debt management – to support the syndication of its €5 billion \nfive-year green bond. This was NatWest Markets’ first ever \nsyndication for the German sovereign, and follows on from \nNatWest Markets leading the UK Government’s long-dated \n£6 billion green bond syndication in October 2021 and Italy’s \n€8.5 billion in March 2021.\nPrior to issuance, NatWest Markets helped to establish a \nsuccessful launch and take-up of the bonds. In particular, NatWest \nMarkets facilitated strong engagement with ESG investors to \nachieve the issuer’s climate ambitions, especially with regard to \nthe energy crisis being experienced in Europe.\nAdditionally, an extensive review of Germany’s ESG ratings proved \nto be a key area of engagement with the Finanzagentur. NatWest \nMarkets helped benchmark Germany versus other European \nsovereigns to provide the client with an in-depth understanding of \ntheir rating and immediate actions that could be made to improve \ntheir score.\nNatWest Markets facilitated strong engagement with ESG investors  \nto achieve the issuer’s climate ambitions, especially with regard  \nto the energy crisis being experienced in Europe.\nNatWest Markets also reached out to gauge investors’ feedback \non the transaction pre-launch. This ensured that queries \nor concerns were answered prior to launch facilitating a \nsuccessful execution.\nIn terms of the investments that the bonds will be funding, the \nFinanzagentur’s Green Bond framework incorporates projects \nacross five categories, with the majority of the sovereign’s current \neligible expenditures focusing on climate change mitigation.\nImportantly, it also dedicates a large proportion to biodiversity \nobjectives, which account for 12% of identified expenditures.\nThe transportation sector attracts half of the eligible expenditures, \nincluding rail transport, road and modal shift to environmentally \nfriendly transportation. The portion directed to renewable energy \nprojects almost doubled prior to its initial green bond launch, \nincorporating measures ranging from energy efficiency to research \nand innovation in renewables.\nClimate transition plan: Case study\n46NatWest Group plc | 2022 Climate-related Disclosures Report\nGovernance Strategy and Climate transition plan Risk Management and Scenario Analysis Metrics and TargetsIntroduction\nClimate transition plan: Powerful \npartnerships and collaborations – \nIndustry engagement \nArea of activity Details of collaboration\nEngagement to influence \nthe net zero agenda\n • We are a founding member of GFANZ through which we collaborate with peers, policy makers and other stakeholders.
