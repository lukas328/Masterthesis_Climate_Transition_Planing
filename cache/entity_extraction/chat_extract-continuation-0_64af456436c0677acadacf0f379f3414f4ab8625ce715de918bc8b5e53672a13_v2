Recyclability rates of different materials and component \ntypes are quantified and estimated based on information from \nlife cycle assessment (LCA) reports. \nMaterial efficiency (tonnes of waste excl. recycled materials \nper MW produced and shipped)\nMaterial efficiency is defined as the total tonnes of non-\nrecycled waste materials from Vestas‚Äô own manufacturing \nper MW capacity produced and shipped during the reporting \nperiod. Non-recycled waste materials include those that are \nincinerated or landfilled.\nCO2e emissions  \nCarbon emissions are measured using the carbon dioxide \nequivalent (CO2e) to include all relevant greenhouse gasses \naccording to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. A distinction is \nmade between scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions, as also defined by \nthe Greenhouse Gas Protocol. \nDirect emissions of CO2e (scope 1) (1,000 t) \nScope 1: Direct emissions of CO2e are calculated based on \ndetermined amounts of fuel for own transport and the direct \nconsumption of fossil-based fuels (e.g., oil and gas), with the \nusage of standard factors published by the UK Department for \nBusiness, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS) (2022). \nIndirect emissions of CO2e (scope 2) (1,000 t) \nScope 2: Covers emissions released in connection with the \nconsumption of purchased electricity and heat. Indirect \nmarket-based emissions of CO2e from consumption of \nelectricity are calculated using national grid emission factors \npublished by the International Energy Agency (2022). Indirect \nCO2e emissions from district heating are calculated using BEIS \n(2022) emission factors. \nEnvironmental \nVestas' environmental key figures encompass the Vestas \nGroup in an operational control perspective (including owned \nand leased entities) ensuring a comprehensive and accurate \nstatement of these figures. This approach applies to all \nenvironmental indicators that are reported for the accounting \nperiod, based on data registered locally in the Vestas reporting \nsystem, consolidated on Group level.\nUtilisation of resources\nConsumption of energy (GWh)\nThis indicator includes electricity, gas, oil, biomass, LPG,  \ndiesel, gasoline, marine gas oil and district heating. Energy  \nis reported based on quantities consumed, including cars \nowned and leased by Vestas, employee benefit cars, and fuel \nfor transportation on project sites, production equipment,  \nand machinery. Consumption of electricity comprises \nelectricity purchased externally. Oil for heating is based on \nexternal purchases and met re readings at the end of the \nreporting period.\nRenewable energy (%)\nElectricity from renewable energy sources is calculated on  \nthe basis of supplier statements. \nRenewable electricity for own activities (%)\nElectricity from renewable energy sources is calculated on the \nbasis of supplier statements. Only 100 percent renewable \nelectricity is counted as renewable electricity. \nWithdrawal of fresh water (1,000 m3)\nThe withdrawal of water is measured by withdrawal of fresh \nwater based on supplier statements and metre readings. \nWaste\nVolume of waste from own operations (1,000 tonnes) and - \nof which collected for recycling (1,000 tonnes)\nVolume of waste is based on weight. Waste disposal method  \nis based on supplier statements.\nBasis for preparation \nof the statement\nGeneral reporting approach\nThe below description of accounting policies refers to the \nenvironmental, social, and governance indicators presented \non page 76.\nAll Vestas‚Äô wholly owned companies are covered by the \nreport. Newly established companies are included from the \ntime of production start, and companies are excluded from \nthe reporting from the specific time when they leave Vestas‚Äô \ncontrol. Acquired companies are included from the specific \ntime when coming under Vestas‚Äô control. \nDefining materiality\nVestas performs its materiality assessment based on an \nanalysis of significant economic, environmental and social \nimpacts of the company‚Äôs activities. The analysis is based \non internal priorities as well as experience from dialogue \nwith and direct involvement of customers, investors, policy \nmakers, employees, and media. The result of the analysis is \nincorporated in the Vestas Sustainability Report, which is \npublished on an annual basis.\nIndirect emissions of CO2e from the supply chain (scope 3) \n(million t) \nScope 3: Indirect emissions of CO2e from the value chain are \nreported based on the Greenhouse Gas Protocol.
