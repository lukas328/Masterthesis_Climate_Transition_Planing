Sustainability data Appendix\nSalient human rights issues \nBoth HRAs identified a number of salient human rights issues across \nour operations and value chain � Every salient human right pertains \nto one or more of our rightsholders groups: our own workforce, \nworkers in our value chain, and affected communities � \nEach salient issue was prioritised according to two sets of criteria: \nthe salience of risk (scale, scope, remediability, likelihood) and \nrelevance for business action (attribution, leverage, risk history, \ncurrent management) � Depending on the salience of risk and the \nrelevance for business action, each salient human rights issue was \nassigned a priority level to signal which issues should be prioritised �\nOur areas for continuous focus remain the same as in 2018: rights \nrelated to labour conditions, occupational health and safety, \ncommunity engagement and land rights, especially focused on \nvulnerable groups such as indigenous communities � Some of the \nnew focus areas identified for business action by our 2022 \nassessment are high-risk and conflict-affected areas, access to \nremedy, and human rights defenders � In the coming years, we will \nprioritise working across the organisation to strengthen our \nprocesses on these issues � \nImprovements made since 2018 HRA\nSince our first HRA in 2018 which concluded that we needed to \nfocus on our governance and management of human rights, as well \nas focus on the salient issues highlighted above, we have reached \nthe following milestones:\n1. Policy improvements:\n• Updated Human Rights Policy (see page 41): in 2019, we updated \nour policy to reflect changes to our due diligence processes and \nremedy access � The new policy also acknowledges more right -\nsholders, including human rights defenders and indigenous \npeoples, and strengthens our commitment to remedying adverse \nimpacts on individuals, workers, and community members � The \npolicy is signed by the Chairman of our Board of Directors �\n•  New Employee Code of Conduct (see page 43): in 2021, we \nupdated our Employee Code of Conduct, to reflect current \nindustry standards and increase our focus on areas such as \ncommunity engagement �\n•  New Supplier Code of Conduct (see page 53): in 2021, we \nlaunched our Supplier Code of Conduct, replacing the Business \nPartner Code of Conduct, in line with our commitments to \ninternational standards, and with an increased focus on topics \nsuch as conflict minerals � \n•  New Conflict Minerals Policy (see page 53): in 2022, we published \na new Conflict Minerals Policy, signed by the Head of Global \nProcurement � \n2. Due diligence processes: \n•  Updated Project-Level Social Due Diligence (see pages 59-61): in \n2020, we updated our Social Due Diligence system to address \nhuman rights issues raised in the HRA recommendations and to \nreflect learnings from projects in emerging markets �\n•  New Conflicts Minerals Program (see pages 56-57): in 2021, we \ncreated our Conflicts Mineral Programme following the \nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's \n(OECD) Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of \nMinerals � To date, we have completed two conflict minerals \nassessments based on supplier reporting, and are in the process \nof completing a third �\n•  Revised Supplier Risk Matrix (see page 53): In 2022 � we initiated \nthe modification of our matrix to help identify suppliers at high \nsustainability risk � We aim to include more risk indices on factors \nsuch as freedom of opinion and expression, indigenous peoples' \nrights and the ethical behaviour of firms � \n3. Grievance and remedy: \n• Incident management system updated: in 2022, we migrated \ndata from our IT system to a new provider to manage grievances \non our operations � As part of this process, the Community Incident \nsection was strengthened and learnings from previous cases were \napplied� \n• Operational grievance reviewed: in 2022, our organisational \ngrievance mechanism underwent a review against the UN Guiding \nPrinciples on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) effectiveness \ncriteria and our new community incident categories �\nFuture improvements to be implemented based on 2022 HRA\nWhile we have made advances on key issues, our 2022 assessment \nhas identified new focus areas for us � Our key actions following the \n2022 HRA will be: \n• Improving human rights governance structure: we will work on \ncreating better human rights governance at different parts of  \nour value chain � This will ensure salient human rights issues are \nunderstood, recognised, prioritised, and well-managed across  \nour operations �  \n• Rare-Earths Usage Mapping: In 2023, we aim to finalise\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
