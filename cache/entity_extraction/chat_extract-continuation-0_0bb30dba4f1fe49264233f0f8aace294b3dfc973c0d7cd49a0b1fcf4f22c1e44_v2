The Remuneration Committee has discretion to accelerate vesting, in which case the performance condition would be assessed based on \navailable information at the time. In either case, unless the Remuneration Committee determines otherwise, the level of vesting shall be pro-rated to reflect \nthe proportion of the performance period which has elapsed to the date of leaving. In the post-vesting deferral period, only those who leave due to \nmisconduct will lose their shares.\nRedundancy arrangements Directors are not entitled to any benefit under any redundancy payments arrangement operated by the company.\nHoliday Upon termination for any reason, directors will be entitled to payment in lieu of accrued but untaken holiday entitlement.\nChair and Non-Executive Directors\nThe Chair and each of the non-executive directors have letters of appointment. The letters of appointment do not contain any contractual entitlement to a termination payment and the \nnon-executive directors can be removed in accordance with the company’s Articles of Association. Directors are required to retire at each AGM and seek re-election by shareholders.\nThe details of the service contracts, including notice periods, contained in the letters of appointment in relation to the non-executive directors who served during the year are set out in the table \nbelow.
