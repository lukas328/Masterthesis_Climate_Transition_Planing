It is to be continuously enhanced over the \ncoming years to learn from most up-to-date scientific and technological findings and to comply with evolving regulation. Going \nforward, updates on our Net-Zero Transition Plan, including progress on the targets, new targets and other changes related but not \nlimited to the implementation of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, will be included in our year-end Non-Financial \nStatement (NFS) in our Annual Report, starting with NFS for fiscal year 2023. In the case of any material updates outside the yearly \nreporting cycle we will communicate accordingly.1 \nA Rationale \nBusinesses and society face existential threats from climate change in a world warming ever faster. As a \nsociety and business community we must manage this risk by mitigating climate change and reducing \nemissions of greenhouse gases at an unprecedented speed and scale. \nThe world’s top climate scientists from the IPCC re-confirmed that countries need to halve greenhouse gas \nemissions by 2030, and halve again by 2040, to then achieve net-zero by 2050. This is expected to give the \nworld a 50% chance of limiting global warming to 1.5°C in the year 2100, compared with pre-industrial \ntimes. Limiting global warming to 1.5°C would still lead to a warmer and more extreme climate than we \nexperience today. Letting the global temperature rise by more than 1.5°C will lead to even more drastic \nand unpredictable events; like flooding of major cities, mass migration from then-uninhabitable areas, or a \nlack of fresh water, to name a few. \nAlready as of today, more than 150 nations, covering around 90% of global population, emissions and GDP \nalike, have net-zero ambitions, including the US, the European Union (EU) and India. Within the United \nStates, 25 States and the District of Columbia have set concrete 2030 targets as well as other intermediate \ndecarbonization targets.2 The EU has set concrete decarbonization targets to be achieved by 2030. \nThe world will only meet these goals and commitments if governments follow through on the Paris \nAgreement ambition of 1.5°C with swift, stable, and reliable policies, action plans and regulations. \nGovernments have started translating their commitments into a range of legislation and initiatives. This \nincludes, for example: \n• sectoral transition plans and support schemes for low-carbon technology (such as the US Inflation \nReduction Act or the EU Fit for 55 Package), and \n• reporting and due diligence directives (like the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive \n(CSRD) and the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) which is currently under \ndevelopment). \n \n1 The last two sentences were added in February 2024 \n2 As of August 2022.

We are committed to \ntransitioning our proprietary investment and P&C underwriting portfolios to net-zero greenhouse gas \n(GHG) emissions by 2050 – consistent with a maximum temperature rise by the end of the century of 1.5°C, \ntaking into account the best available scientific knowledge, including the findings of the IPCC3 – and to net-\nzero GHG emissions by 2030 within our own operations. This is with the expectation that governments will \nfollow through on their own commitments to ensure the objectives of the Paris Agreement are met. \nWe seize opportunities to drive decarbonization and climate resilience through our resources, partnerships, \nexpertise, and influence. Our ambition is to be a trusted partner for our clients and investee companies \nacross different sectors in their transition toward net-zero. Our climate approach is grounded in the Allianz \nGroup Climate Change Strategy, which has been in place since 2005. With a special focus on UN \nSustainable Development Goal 13, Climate Action, we take into account climate risk and opportunity \nanalytics for our organization and across our business areas where we exercise decision-making and have \nalready taken significant steps in the past decade. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAs a key next step in our journey, we publish this Inaugural Net-Zero Transition Plan. It is informed \nespecially by the recommendations of the UN High-Level Expert Group on Net-Zero Commitments of Non-\nState Actors. \nTo substantiate our long-term net-zero commitments, we have set intermediary targets for 2025 for our \nproprietary investments. We are on a good track to achieving those targets along all levers.4  \nWith this Inaugural Transition Plan we are announcing our 2030 targets for proprietary investments \nand P&C underwriting in our commercial and motor retail businesses.  \nThe targets are informed by IPCC 1.5°C climate scenarios5 and by credible industry-led approaches, for \nexample the Target Setting Protocol of the Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance, which was named the “gold \nstandard for credible commitments and transparent targets” by UN Secretary-General António Guterres.6 \nWhen setting these portfolio targets, we are dependent on change in policy and the real economy to \nachieve them. \nTherefore, we are advocating for strong climate policy from governments across the globe. A supportive \npolicy environment is crucial to ensuring the viability of a socially just transition to\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DRAFTF<|>ORGANIZATION<|>DRAFTF is an organization involved in publishing the Inaugural Net-Zero Transition Plan)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INAGURAL NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLAN<|>EVENT<|>The plan is a strategic document outlining commitments and targets for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and 2050)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEPTEMBER 2023<|>EVENT<|>The publication date of the Inaugural Net-Zero Transition Plan)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALLIANZ<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Allianz is a leading global insurer and investor committed to transitioning to net-zero emissions by 2050 and 2030 within its operations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IPCC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is a scientific body providing assessments on climate change, whose findings inform Allianz's climate strategy)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNITED STATES<|>GEO<|>The US is a country with 25 states and the District of Columbia that have set concrete 2030 decarbonization targets)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EU<|>GEO<|>The European Union is a political and economic union with set decarbonization targets to be achieved by 2030)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARIS AGREEMENT<|>EVENT<|>An international treaty aiming to limit global warming to 1.5°C, which influences national climate commitments)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>US INFLATION REDUCTION ACT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Legislation supporting low-carbon technology and climate action in the US)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EU FIT FOR 55 PACKAGE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>EU legislative package aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UN HIGH-LEVEL EXPERT GROUP ON NET-ZERO COMMITMENTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A UN body providing recommendations that inform Allianz's net-zero commitments)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NET-ZERO ASSET OWNER ALLIANCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An alliance setting credible targets for asset owners to achieve net-zero emissions, serving as a benchmark for Allianz's targets)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UN SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOAL 13<|>EVENT<|>A global goal focused on Climate Action, guiding Allianz's climate approach)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IPCC 1.5°C CLIMATE SCENARIOS<|>EVENT<|>Scientific scenarios used by Allianz to inform its 2030 and 2050 targets)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POLICY<|>EVENT<|>Refers to the legislative and regulatory environment that influences the achievement of climate targets)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DRAFTF<|>INAGURAL NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLAN<|>DRAFTF published the plan<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALLIANZ<|>INAGURAL NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLAN<|>Allianz published the Inaugural Net-Zero Transition Plan<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IPCC<|>ALLIANZ<|>IPCC scientific findings inform Allianz’s climate strategy<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNITED STATES<|>ALLIANZ<|>US states' targets influence Allianz’s regional strategies<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EU<|>ALLIANZ<|>EU decarbonization targets influence Allianz’s regional strategies<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PARIS AGREEMENT<|>ALLIANZ<|>The Paris Agreement provides international climate commitments that guide Allianz's goals<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>US INFLATION REDUCTION ACT<|>ALLIANZ<|>US legislation supporting low-carbon tech impacts Allianz’s US operations<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EU FIT FOR 55<|>ALLIANZ<|>EU policy package influences Allianz’s European strategies<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UN HIGH-LEVEL EXPERT GROUP<|>ALLIANZ<|>Recommendations from the UN body inform Allianz’s net-zero commitments<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NET-ZERO ASSET OWNER ALLIANCE<|>ALLIANZ<|>Allianz’s targets are aligned with the alliance’s standards for credible net-zero commitments<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UN SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOAL 13<|>ALLIANZ<|>The goal guides Allianz’s climate action initiatives<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IPCC 1.5°C SCENARIOS<|>ALLIANZ<|>Scenarios inform Allianz’s 2030 and 2050 emission reduction targets<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
