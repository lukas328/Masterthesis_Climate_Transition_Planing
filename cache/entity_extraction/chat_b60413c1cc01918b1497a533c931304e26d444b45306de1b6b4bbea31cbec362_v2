Approach to setting electric power sector targets \nBasis for selecting \nthe electric power \nsector \n We recognize that the decarbonization of power generation is essential to the decarbonization of \nsociety and industries as a whole, and that it is important to reduce the emission intensity of \npower generation projects through actions like supporting the widespread adoption of renewable \nenergy and the development and practical application of next-generation technology. \n Emissions from the electric power sector make up a large proportion of emissions from Mizuho’s \nfinancing and investments. (Detailed explanation on p. 61: Measurement of financed emissions \nbased on PCAF) \n Mizuho has appointed companies whose primary businesses are in coal-, oil-, or gas-fired power \ngeneration as belonging to transition risk sectors. Focusing on the medium to long term, we are \nformulating policies to support these companies in their climate change countermeasures and \ntransition to a low-carbon society. \n Progress is being made in the electric power sector in establishing GHG emission disclosures, \ntransition pathways to net zero by 2050, and a variety of international guidance. \nApproach to metrics \nand emission \nintensity \nTargets are measured in emission intensity (GHG emissions per unit of power generated) for the \nreasons below. \n It is important to reduce the emission intensity of power generation projects through actions like \nsupporting the widespread adoption of renewable energy and the development and practical \napplication of next-generation technology in order to achieve the decarbonization of society and \nindustries as a whole. \n As part of the process of transitioning to a low-carbon society, the growing energy demand in \nemerging economies and the promotion of electrification has made it necessary to respond to an \nincrease in demand for electric power. \n If targets were set based on absolute emissions, there is a possibility that finance flows intended \nfor the growth and expansion of power generation projects with low emission factors could be \nimpeded. \nTarget applicability \n Targets apply to Scope 1 GHG emissions from power generation projects. These projects are \nresponsible for the majority of emissions from the electric power sector. \n Out of the electric power sector companies (companies whose main business is electric power11) \nin Mizuho’s finance portfolio, targets apply to corporate finance for companies with power \ngeneration projects and project finance for power generation projects. \nNote: Includes close to 100% of targeted project.  \nThe NZBA stipulates that companies receiving more than 5% of their revenue from power \ngeneration projects should fall within the scope of these targets. There is currently no set method \nfor specifying the applicability of companies, and this is an issue for future consideration. \nApproach to \nbenchmark \nscenarios \n In line with the Paris Agreement, we are pursuing efforts to hold the increase in the global \naverage temperature to well below 2°C and to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C. \nAccordingly, we have set a targeted value range. \n Because the NZBA, with regard to scenario selection, requires that scenarios limit end-of-century \nglobal temperature increase to 1.5°C, that the scenarios selected be “no-overshoot” or “low-\novershoot” scenarios, and that the scenarios come from credible, well-recognized sources, we \nhave selected the IEA scenarios below. \n1. Minimum value: 138 kgCO2/MWh \nIn alignment with the IEA’s NZE scenario, which sees the rise in temperature limited to 1.5°C. \nThis is the level we should aim for in order to pursue efforts to limit temperature increase to \n1.5°C. \n2. Maximum value: 232 kgCO2/MWh \nIn alignment with the IEA’s SDS Scenario, which sees a 67% probability of limiting the rise in \ntemperature to under 1.8°C, and a 50% probability of limiting the rise to 1.65°C. \nThe road to net zero by 2050 will vary by business location, and so targets should be set with \nconsideration for region-specific characteristics and support for the achievement of Nationally \nDetermined Contributions (NDCs). For this reason, country-specific SDS scenarios are \ncalculated using country-specific portfolios, and targets are set accordingly. \n                                         \n11 Sectors are determined based on which sector represents the largest component in the sales of a company’s business activities. Regarding \nour classification method, we determine sectors based on the industry type classification established by the Bank of Japan. \n  \nTCFD Report 2022  -25- \n \nData source \n Information disclosed by clients, Bloomberg, meeting discussion points, etc. \nFor companies that do not calculate or disclose GHG emissions (which represent 13% of the total \namount of targeted electric power sector loans), we estimated the\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
