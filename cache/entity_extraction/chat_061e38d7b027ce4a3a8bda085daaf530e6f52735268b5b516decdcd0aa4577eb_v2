We subtract any water that \nis returned to the source from which it is extracted at the same or better quality .\nNitrogen Oxide (NOx) emissions\nThis KPI is a record of direct emissions of harmful nitrogen oxides to the environment from \nour manufacturing facilities. NOx is a generic term which includes nitric oxide (NO) and \nnitrogen dioxide (NO2), but excludes nitrous oxide (N2O). \nWe measure this KPI in metric tonnes. The value is derived from continuous monitoring \nequipment where present, or from stoichiometric calculations based on our knowledge \nof NOx generation from our chemical processes. We consider all sources of NOx from the \ncombustion of fuel in steam boilers to the gaseous output of our processes that emit NOx. \nWe report the value after any abatement or treatment has taken place within our \nchimney stacks.\nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 2023 227\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION\nBasis of reporting – non-financial data continued\nPeople\nOur goal: Keep people safe\nTotal recordable injury and illness rate (TRIIR) is defined as the number of recordable cases \nper 200,000 hours worked in a rolling year and includes cases affecting both our employees \nand contractors.\nA recordable case (as defined under the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration \n(OSHA) Regulations) is defined as a work related accident or illness that results in one or \nmore of the following: absence of more than one day; medical treatment beyond first aid; \ndeath; loss of consciousness and restricted work or transfer to another job.\nThe OSHA severity rate is a calculation that gives a company an average of the number \nof lost days and restricted days per recordable incident.\nThe process safety event severity rate (PSESR) is measured according to the methodology \napproved by International Council of Chemical Associations (ICCA). The metric first requires \na determination that the event is to be included in the process safety event severity rate \n(PSESR) calculation and then determining the severity using the severity table.\nIn determining this rate, 1 point is assigned for each Level 4 incident attribute, 3 points \nfor each Level 3 attribute, 9 points for each Level 2 attribute, and 27 points for each Level 1 \nattribute. The PSESR is recorded as a 12 month rolling number. Total worker hours include \nemployees, temporary employees and contractors.\nTheoretically, a process safety event could be assigned a minimum of 1 point (i.e. the incident \nmeets the attributes of a Level 4 incident in only one category) or a maximum of 135 points \n(i.e. the incident meets the attributes of a Level 1 incident in each of the five categories).\nA Tier 1 Process Safety Event (T-1 PSE) is a loss of primary containment (LOPC) with the \ngreatest consequence as defined by American Petroleum Institute recommended practice \n(RP) 754.\nOur goal: Create a diverse, inclusive and engaged company\nEmployee Engagement\nAll permanent and fixed term contract employees are invited to voluntarily complete an \nemployee survey at regular intervals to determine the engagement and wellbeing of staff \nusing a standard methodology defined by Workday Peakon – an independent third party \nused by companies globally. All responses are submitted confidentially to Workday Peakon \nand results are independently analysed and shared with all managers who met the minimum \nresponse threshold of five responses from their team. Through the survey we measure \nattributes on a scale of 0 to 10. \nThe survey measures employee engagement through three questions:\n1) to what extent they would recommend JM as employer to others, \n2) to what extent they intend to stay with JM, \n3) in general how satisfied they are with their employment at JM.\nGender diversity\nOur target KPI counts the percentage of all management level employees (permanent and \ntemporary) who are registered female on the 31st March in the reporting year. \nFor this purpose, an employee’s gender is determined based on their registered gender at birth \nor otherwise legally recognised gender as disclosed by the employee.  \nOur goal: Invest in our local communities\nOur target KPI is an annual record of the total number of employee volunteering days undertaken \nby permanent employees within their local communities, in accordance with JM’s global \nEmployee Volunteering Policy. The volunteering is recorded in days, assuming that the standard \nfull-time equivalent employee day is 8 hours. The recorded volunteering days may have been \ncompleted either on company time or on paid company leave. Volunteering done on unpaid \nleave, or outside normal working hours, is not included in the reported numbers. In determining \nthe in-kind contribution of employees’ volunteering we take the number of volunteering days \nreported in the year and multiply it by the group average cost of one day of employee time.\nCalculation for indirect expenditure in  \ncommunity investment\nNumber of working days in a year is five days per week for 50 weeks per year.\nAverage cost of one day of \nemployee time =\nTotal employee benefits expense in year\nNumber of working days in\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
