We have various channels for them to do this \nincluding our independent Speak Up line. In 2022/23 we received 153 Speak Up reports \ncompared to158 in 2021/22. We see this as a positive sign that our people and other \nstakeholders feel comfortable raising concerns and have faith in our process. \nWe analyse Speak Up metrics quarterly to identify key themes and significant trends and \nshare these with the Ethics Panel and relevant senior leaders. This year members of senior \nmanagement were invited to Ethics Panel meetings to address themes, trends and lessons \nlearned in their business to drive further business accountability.\nOur Ethics Panel is chaired by our General Counsel and comprised of independent members \nof the GLT and other senior leaders. It meets quarterly, oversees all Speak Ups and takes \nappropriate action where necessary. The Board is updated on key Speak Up trends and the \nmost significant cases during Societal Value Committee meetings. See pages 80-89 for more \ninformation.\nCategories of recommendations made in Speak Up cases closed during the year are \nsummarised in the table opposite. \nDuring the financial year, 14 Speak Ups relating to bribery and corruption were reported, \nthough in some instances multiple reports were raised about the same alleged conduct. JM \nhas a zero-tolerance approach to bribery and corruption, and our Ethics & Compliance team \nthoroughly investigated to determine whether the allegations could be proven or whether \nany recommendations should be made, as it does with all categories of Speak Ups. Even \nwhere allegations of bribery and corruption are not proven, an assessment was made to \nensure the risk of bribery and corruption taking place in the future is properly mitigated. \nDuring the financial year no legal cases regarding bribery and corruption were brought \nagainst JM or its employees. \nSpeak Up reports 2022/23\nConcern / allegation  Number of cases\nBribery and corruption 14 \nConflict of interest 6 \nDiscrimination, harassment, bullying or retaliation 47\nEmployee rights 56 \nEnquiry 5\nEnvironmental protection, product stewardship or health and safety 11\nFinancial crime 2\nInsider trading, financial reporting and other securities violations 1\nTheft or misuse of assets 6\nTrade and export controls 1\nOther 4\nRecommendations following investigated reports in 2022/23\nRecommendation (please note there could be more than one recommendation per report,  \nor in some cases none) Number of cases\nSeparation with employee 4 \nVerbal or written warning 3 \nCoaching / training 21 \nCommunication 34 \nInternal review of processes 28\nUpdate / create new standards / controls 16\nSenior leadership or management actions 21\nRemedy for the reporter 6\nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 2023 41\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTSOTHER INFORMATION\nSustainability continued\nOur goal: Investing in our communities\nAs a company driven by our shared purpose, we have a duty to all our stakeholders, including \nour local communities. Not only do our products and services deliver significant positive \nimpact for society and for our customers, but we recognise the important role our people play \nin communities too. \nRefocusing our approach \nOur reinvigorated community investment strategy builds on two core beliefs. Firstly, we \nbelieve that science will be key in tackling many of the biggest challenges the world is facing. \nThat’s why we remain committed to removing the barriers that exist for young people in \naccessing and staying in high-quality science, technology, engineering and mathematics \n(STEM) education. We also know that building a positive legacy in the communities where \nwe operate is of the highest importance to our people. So we are introducing a second strand \nto our strategy: sustainable communities, which is all about our contribution to green \ninitiatives or other local needs. \nOur volunteering and match funding efforts have had an enormous positive impact over the \nmany years we have been offering this support. Our new approach focuses these efforts and \nresources, and aligns them behind our purpose to catalyse the net zero transition. By 2030 \nwe aim to reach 10,000 young people, typically excluded from science, through quality \nSTEM-related interactions and experiences involving our employees. To get there, we’ll be \nfocusing on fewer, stronger, multi-year partnerships with community organisations, better \ntracking and reporting on the impact of our activities, and establishing clear roadmaps for \nhow we will achieve our objectives.\n2,063 \nvolunteering days (+56%)\nOur performance in 2022/23 \nA large part of our work this year has been forming our \nnew approach – but that doesn’t mean that there haven’t \nbeen some great achievements too. We have been able to \nreact to some of the challenges people across our \ncommunities faced in 2022/23.\nThe impacts of the cost-of-living crisis caused by rising inflation and energy costs have been \nfelt across the world.
