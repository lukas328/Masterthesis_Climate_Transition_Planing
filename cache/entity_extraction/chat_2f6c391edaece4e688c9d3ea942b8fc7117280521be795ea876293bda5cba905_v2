We plan to leverage existing \ncustomer engagement touch points and propositions to gather information around maturity of customers’ \ntransition plans. This assessment will help us understand where the customer is in their climate transition \njourney and opportunities for NatWest Group to support them to transition. Climate actions to date and \nchanges in emissions profile, forward-looking decarbonisation targets, governance and actions in place to \nexecute transition plans will be factored into the CTPA. In late 2022 and early 2023, we launched a small-scale \ntest and learn approach with a small numbers of customers to ensure the framework we develop is fit-for-\npurpose. This will continue to be refined throughout 2023.\n • Climate risk scorecards: During 2022, we worked on developing a more quantitative methodology to enhance \nthe existing qualitative climate risk scorecards, already in use. The methodology is designed to assess the \ninherent level of physical and transition risk the customer faces and considers their ability to mitigate transition \nrisk, using insights from the CTPA. We will use the insights provided by this tool to understand the degree of \nclimate-related risk faced by our customers and how they can best mitigate these risks. For further details see \nsection 4.2.\n • Internal Carbon Pricing (ICP): This is an internal management framework to embed climate in decision-\nmaking, including decisions related to lending transactions, with an aim to support customers’ transition. In its \nfully developed state, ICP will be assessed based on customer emissions profiles coupled with their transition \npotential based on individual CTPA assessments. In 2022, we started to test this framework at a sector level \nand will continue to refine the approach, methodology and framework during 2023.\nThe development, testing and evolution of the customer-level decisioning framework and tools will continue during \n2023. Once fully developed, our intention is to utilise these tools in supporting business decisions (such as \ntransaction acceptance standards), capital allocation and pricing decisions, portfolio risk appetite measures as well \nas credit decisions.\nDuring 2022 Commercial & Institutional also continued to enhance pricing frameworks to factor in purpose \nand climate considerations. These enhancements and frameworks ensure NatWest Group continues to \nprovide support and incentivises businesses to help address the climate challenge and to reshape the \nCommercial & Institutional portfolio towards more sustainable transactions and sectors.\n • For our SME customers, enhancements were made to Invoice Finance and Trade Loan pricing \nframeworks. These enhancements provide pricing discounts for customers within sub-sectors most \nclosely aligned to our purpose and climate ambitions and overall strategic objectives. These \nenhancements build on our SME Loan and Overdraft pricing frameworks, which were aligned to our \nclimate goals in 2021.\n • For Corporate customers we continue to allocate a reduced level of capital for customers and \ntransactions that align to our purpose and climate ambitions. This allows for more competitive pricing.\nEnhanced pricing frameworks \n50NatWest Group plc | 2022 Climate-related Disclosures Report\nGovernance Strategy and Climate transition plan Risk Management and Scenario Analysis Metrics and TargetsIntroduction\nClimate transition plan: Our own operations\n • We are targeting to achieve net zero by 2050 for our operational value chain(1) emissions covering Scopes 1, 2 \nand all relevant categories in Scope 3. For further detail on our operational value chain please see section 5.4.\n • For our own operations, this means aiming to reduce by 50% our direct own operations(2) by 2025 and our \noperational value chain by 2030, with a minimum 90% reduction by 2050. We plan to neutralise the residual \n10% through the use of carbon credits in line with ‘SBTi Corporate Net Zero Standard’ released in October \n2021. This phased approach is shown in our road map below.\n • We purchased and retired 120,000 carbon removal credits, assured under the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS), \nand Triple Gold certified to the Climate, Community & Biodiversity Alliance Standards (CCBA) to invest beyond \nour value chain, and provide benefits to climate, especially those that generate additional co-benefits for people \nand nature.\n • In accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
