Judgement is \nexercised in determining whether the circumstances \nshould give rise to the recognition of provisions or \ncontingent liabilities. \nIn the case of material contingent liabilities further \njudgement is required in arriving at appropriate \ndisclosure of such matters. A material contingent \nliability has been disclosed in relation to a Chilean \nsubsidiary, Isapre Cruz Blanca. \nThe Committee considered potential material contingent liabilities \nacross the Bupa Group through their review of the key accounting \nand tax judgements presented by management. \nIn relation to Isapre Cruz Blanca the Committee were provided \nwith extensive additional information and analysis by management. \nThe Committee considered and challenged management’s technical \naccounting assessment of the IAS 37 provision criteria, in particular \nthe judgement that a reliable estimate could not be formed, and \ntherefore no provision recognised, as at 31 December 2022. In \naddition, the Committee considered the disclosure made within \nthe financial statements for appropriateness and completeness. \nThe Committee also reviewed reporting from the External Auditor \nregarding the IAS 37 accounting judgements and Bupa’s contingent \nliability disclosures. \nThe Committee concluded that both management’s assessment that \nno provision could be reliably estimated as at 31 December 2022 and \nthe related contingent liability disclosure were appropriate. \nFair, balanced and understandable \nIn assessing whether the 2022 Annual Report was fair, \nbalanced and understandable, the Committee found as \nfollows: \n▪ The narrative reporting in the Strategic Report is \nconsistent with the financial statements, providing \nchallenge and feedback throughout the compilation \nof the 2022 Annual Report. \n▪ The key judgements referred to in the narrative \nreporting and the significant issues reported in this \nAudit Committee report are consistent with the \nfinancial statements. \n▪ Statutory and alternative performance measures, \nsuch as underlying profit, have been given equal \nprominence and are clearly explained. \n▪ Key performance indicators reflect those used to \nmeasure business performance, and management are \nable to explain their relevance in assessing the results. \n▪ Clear, simple explanations are given of the business \nmodel, Bupa’s strategy and accounting policies. \n▪ Key messages are clearly highlighted with consistent \nwording throughout the 2022 Annual Report. \n▪ The layout and presentation are clear with \nappropriate language used throughout. \nGoing concern and longer-term viability \nManagement presented their going concern assessment \nto the Committee ahead of the Board’s approval of the \nGroup’s 2022 half year results and 2022 Annual Report. \nThis included analysis of the impact of a number of \nstress scenarios on the Group’s base plan for the period \n2023-2025 and their impact on Bupa’s solvency, \nliquidity, borrowings and trading profitability. It further \nconsidered contingent liabilities, guarantees and \ncommitments and the Group’s current risk management \npolicies and procedures. The Committee agreed with \nmanagement’s conclusion that in each plausible \nscenario the testing provided comfort that Bupa \nwas expected to remain a going concern. \nRestoring trust in audit and corporate \ngovernance reforms \nThe Committee is overseeing management’s response \nto the reforms proposed by the UK Government's \nformer Department for Business, Energy and Industrial \nStrategy (BEIS) and the Financial Reporting Council \n(FRC) on restoring trust in audit and corporate \ngovernance (the Reforms). The Reforms could impose \nadditional responsibilities on companies and audit \ncommittees in relation to corporate reporting, internal \ncontrols and external audit requirements. The exact \nscope and nature of many of the requirements is still \nuncertain, with further detailed proposals yet to be \npublished for consultation. The Committee has also \nagreed that an Audit and Assurance Policy should \nbe developed as this is consistent with the wider \nobjective of the Reforms to build trust and credibility \nby improving the quality of corporate reporting. This \nPolicy will cover both financial and non-financial \nreporting, including our wider ESG reporting. \nBupa Annual Report 2022 70 \n        \n        \n           \n        \n       \n        \n         \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n     \n   \n          \n       \n          \n          \n         \n           \n        \n    \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n          \n           \n     \n  \n       \n       \n      \n \n      \n        \n        \n        \n \n       \n          \n        \n        \n        \n     \n         \n          \n          \n         \n         \n      \n          \n     \n       \n        \n     \n       \n   \n      \n          \n \n  \n        \n          \n       \n           \n         \n        \n          \n         \n            \n     \n  \n       \n       \n           \n       \n       \n        \n       \n       \n         \n        \n       \n        \n         \n       \n        \n         \n        \n         \n        \n       \n          \n          \n       \n        \n         \n       \n        \n       \n      \n       \n         \n         \n       \n        \n    \n          \n   \n   \nStrategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements \nAudit Committee report continued \nThe Committee and the Risk Committee annually assess \nBupa’s system of risk management and internal control \nand report their findings to the Board.
