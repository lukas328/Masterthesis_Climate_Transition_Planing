Our senior leaders and directors participate \nin this PSP. This clearly reflects our intent to contribute to an acceleration of the transition \nto a net zero world.

The CEO is supported \nby the Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO), who chairs the Sustainability Council which is made \nup of members from the GLT and the Sustainability Director who together, develop our \nsustainability vision, goals and targets.\nThe CSO is responsible for prioritising our sustainability agenda and threading all elements \ninto our business, providing updates to the GLT on the steps taken to develop or implement \nour sustainability strategy, including key metrics, risks, opportunities and our roadmaps to \nnet zero by 2040. \nAt a business / working level, there are work streams for advancing specific aspects of \nsustainability.

Climate change offers us many business growth opportunities through our \nproducts and services, as well as some risks. The pace at which the world will adapt to the \nimpacts of climate change is uncertain. So that we properly understand and are resilient \nto these uncertainties we maintain climate-change scenarios to frame the ambiguities \nin our long-term business strategy of an increasingly volatile and complex environment.\nClimate scenarios for evaluating transition risks and opportunities\nOur climate scenarios are used by all of our businesses as a common basis for planning, \nforecasting and stress testing their strategy and assumptions on growth. These scenarios, \nwhich project the impact of climate change on our operational and commercial performance, \nare essential in informing our strategic decisions, such as how we invest in R&D and assets, \nor which new products to develop. We also use climate scenarios to consider the resilience \nto changing weather patterns of our own operations, those of our strategic suppliers and our \ncore supply routes.\nOur three transition scenarios represent three global temperature rise pathways.\n• Rapid transition scenario (aligned to 1.5oC) – net zero achieved globally by 2050, in line \nwith the goal of the Paris Agreement to limit the world’s temperature rise to well below \n2oC. This reflects swift and decisive action regarding policy interventions and \ndecarbonisation commitments.\n• Pragmatic evolution scenario (aligned to 2oC) – net zero achieved globally by 2080, which \nreflects a step-up in policy interventions and decarbonisation commitments compared with \ntoday, but not as decisive as under the rapid transition scenario.\n• Slow transition scenario (aligned to 3oC) – net zero not achieved by 2100, reflecting \na global lack of urgency on climate change with limited policy or legislative interventions.\nWe developed our climate scenarios internally, with support from an external expert, \nreflecting the latest available research from the International Energy Agency (IEA). The IEA \nresearch we used included three scenarios: the Net Zero Emissions Scenario, the Announced \nPledges Scenario, and the Stated Policies Scenario.
