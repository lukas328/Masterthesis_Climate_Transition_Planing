Risks were assessed in relation to their possible materialization \nperiod, considering short-term (up to 5 years), medium term (from 5 to 10 years) and long term (above 10 years), periods, \nclassified according to the type of the risk (physical, transition or both) and possible qualitative materialization scenarios. \nMapping was the first step to start prioritizing our climate risks. \nClimate risk factor and materialization trend (in years) Credit Operational Market Liquidity\nTransition risk\nClimate regulations and regulator’s oversight Up to 2 years\nMandatory disclosure Up to 2 years\nWorsening of portfolio credit quality 5 to 10 years\nPortfolio climate exposure and climate taxonomy Up to 2 years\nChange in pricing of assets and properties 5 to 10 years\nClimate litigation 2 to 5 years\nStranded assets > 10 years\nCarbon pricing 2 to 5 years\nCarbon reduction, neutralization and removal 5 to 10 years\nChange in environmental legislation 5 to 10 years\nMarket barriers and stakeholder requirement Up to 2 years\nPhysical risk\nPhysical risk impact\nOther secondary consequences of climate risks\nPotential materialization in \nother risk disciplines\nNot relevant\nMedium relevance\nRelevant\n20 \nItaú Unibanco Holding S.A.climate report 2022\nUpon mapping these risks, we took into account the qualitative climate scenarios described below. \nQualitative scenarios used in risk mapping*\nScenario 1: \nOrderly transition\nIn this scenario, the transition to a low-carbon \neconomy starts immediately and proceeds in \nan orderly way with actions taken by regulators \nand the government to ensure financial \nstability. Economy will have time to adjust to the \nnew scenario. \nScenario 2:\nAbrupt transition \nIn this scenario, governments and regulators act late \nand the transition occurs in an abrupt and disorderly \nway, with greater impact on certain sectors and \ncountries. Financial crisis and unemployment are \nmore likely in carbon-intensive sectors.\nScenario 3: \nMaterialization of physical risks \n(hot house world)\nIn this scenario, no transition occurs and the \ngoals of the Paris Agreement are not achieved. \nThe physical effects of climate change become \nincreasingly evident, especially starting in \n2030. The occurrence of extreme events and \nirreversible changes in climate patterns can alter \nthe productivity of a number of economic sectors \nand lead to systemic environmental, social and \neconomic crises.\nScenario 4: \nToo little, too late\nIn this scenario, transition actions fall short \nof what is required or are delayed, generating \ninsufficient effect to ensure that the climate \ngoals of the Paris Agreement are achieved. \nTherefore, the presence of physical risks \nbecomes greater and more evident and \npropels a disordered transition that can be \ndisruptive and abrupt. \n* https://www.ngfs.net/ngfs-scenarios-portal/\n21 \nItaú Unibanco Holding S.A.climate report 2022\nThe table below shows some non-exhaustive examples of key actions to mitigate climate risk in our strategy. \n Identified risks and mitigation strategies  \nEvent Climate risk management initiatives\nClimate regulations and oversight of financial \nmarket regulators  • We monitor and secure compliance with regulatory requirements. \nMandatory disclosure  • We participate in sector associations with a climate focus to monitor the best practices and standardize information that facilitates \ncomparability among institutions.\nWorsening of portfolio credit quality and portfolio \nclimate exposure\n • We assess clients through an internal tool to better direct the offer of products and solutions to the transition economy.\n • Sensitivity to client risk rating and monitoring and reporting of Itaú Unibanco’s loan portfolio exposure to climate risks. \n • Reduction of portfolio exposure to climate risk through green products and business and incentives for positive impact sectors.\nFinancial impact on assets and real estate\n • Contingency plans for climate risks. \n • Assessment of exposure of branches to flooding risks.\n • Diligence in the financing of real estate projects with specific documentation requirements, in-site verifications and remote reports.\nClimate litigation  • Follow-up and response to legislative issues and manifestations of civil society in the national and international market. \nStranded assets\n • Assessment of exposure of branches to flooding risks.\n • Decarbonization targets. \n • Thermal coal phase-out.\nCarbon Pricing\n • Renewable solar power generation for branches.\n • Advocacy before the public authorities to encourage carbon regulation.\n • Risk rating sensitivity.\nCarbon reduction, neutralization and removal  • All initiatives in our climate strategy are aimed at carbon reduction, neutralization and/or removal.\nChange in environmental legislation  • Follow-up and response to legislative issues in the domestic and international markets.\nMarket barriers and stakeholder requirements\n • Participation in sector associations with a climate focus within the scope of Febraban, CEBDS, UNEP-FI, Global Compact and ICC to monitor \nrequirements, benchmarking and information standardization.\n • Advocacy before the public authorities to foster carbon regulation.\nPhysical risk impacts\n • Contingency plans for climate risks. \n • Assessment of exposure of branches to flooding risks.\n • Sensitivity to risk rating of Itaú BBA’s clients.\nOther secondary consequences of climate risks  • Our climate strategy initiatives aim at reducing direct and indirect risks in the short, medium and long terms, including by following \nmarket trends.\n22 \nItaú Unibanco Holding S.A.climate report 2022\nOp\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
