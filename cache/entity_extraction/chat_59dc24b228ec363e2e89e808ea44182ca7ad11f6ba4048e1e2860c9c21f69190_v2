Managementâ€™s estimate of the range of possible outcomes is an increase in \nthose liabilities by Â£66 million (2022: Â£83 million) to a decrease of Â£55 million (2022: Â£93 million). \nWhere the precise impact of the tax laws and regulations on taxes payable with respect to profit \narising in those jurisdictions is unclear, the group seeks to make reasonable estimates to determine \nthe most likely amount in a range of possible outcomes. \nThere is inherent judgement and estimation uncertainty involved in determining provisions \nforÂ uncertain tax positions, as described by management in the accounting policies to the financial \nstatements. Our audit focused on the most significant of exposures based on both the provision \nrecorded and maximum possible exposure.\nWe engaged our tax specialists in support of our audit of tax and obtained an understanding \nof the groupâ€™s tax strategy and risks. We recalculated the groupâ€™s tax provisions and \ndetermined whether the treatments adopted were in line with the groupâ€™s tax policies and \nhad been applied consistently. \nWe evaluated the key underlying assumptions and judgements, including considering the \nstatus of tax authority audits and enquiries through examining the latest correspondence and \nenquiring of management, and where applicable managementâ€™s advisors. We considered the \nbasis and support in particular for provisions not subject to tax audit, in comparison with our \nexperience of similar situations. \nWe discussed the recognition of specific uncertain tax positions with thirdâ€‘party tax advisors \nappointed by management to verify the key assumptions, judgements and likely outcome \nwith respect to specific uncertain tax positions recognised. We confirmed the appropriateness \nof managementâ€™s application of either a single best estimate, or a weighted average range \nofÂ outcomes, for each exposure, as driven by the facts and circumstances under IFRIC 23. \nWe evaluated the consistency of managementâ€™s approach to identifying triggering events \ntoÂ reassess or record a provision for an exposure. \nWe also evaluated the consistency of managementâ€™s approach to establishing or changing \nprior provision estimates and validated that changes in provisions established in previous \nperiods reflected a change in facts and circumstances. \nWe consider the disclosures with respect to tax matters to be appropriate. \nBased on the procedures performed, we noted no material issues arising from our work.\nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 2023136\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION\nIndependent auditorsâ€™ report to the members of Johnson Matthey Plc continued\nKey audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter\nClaims, uncertainties and other provisions (group and parent)\nRefer to the Significant issues considered by the Audit Committee on page 98 and notes 4, 22, 32, \n36 and 47 to the financial statements. \nThis risk covers warranty provisions, product liability issues, and other litigious matters across the \ngroup. There is inherent judgement and estimation involved in determining when and how much \nto provide for claims and uncertainties. \nDue to the complex nature of the products offered by Johnson Matthey, the group at any point \ninÂ time may be exposed to product liability issues including claims for damages or compensation. \nThe assumptions underpinning these claims and the identification of when such claims arise \nareÂ inherently judgemental. Careful consideration needs to be given as to how the claim and any \npotential exposure are estimated and subsequently accounted for. \nThe group is also involved in various legal proceedings, including actual or threatened litigation and \nregulatory investigations. The number and nature of claims vary from year to year; note 32 discloses \nthe major movements in the year. The two most significant movements included the closure of the \ncontingent liability relating to failures in certain engine systems for which the group supplied a \nparticular coated substrate as a component for that customerâ€™s emissions afterâ€‘treatment systems \nand the new contingent liability arising following the sale of its Health Business in May 2022. \nThe group discloses such risks as contingent liabilities where it is unable to make a reliable estimate \nof potential exposures or where it believes a possible outflow is not probable. If the group is unable \nto defend against such claims, these risks could give rise to a future liability.\nFor litigation matters, we read the summary of major litigation matters provided by \nmanagement and held discussions with group and sector level general counsel. For a sample \nof matters, we obtained and reviewed correspondence with external legal counsel, including \nany particulars of claim. \nWe have circularised external legal counsel to independently assess legal exposures and the \nexpected outcome for material cases across the group. \nWe reviewed board minutes and made inquiries of management to address the risk of \nundisclosed claims and uncertainties. We performed audit procedures to identify all third \nparty legal counsel used by management and as appropriate included them in our \ncircularisation. \nWe applied professional scepticism in auditing both the likely outcome and quantification \nofÂ exposures, including performing audit procedures over claims management determined \ntoÂ be immaterial, and being sceptical of where a constructive obligation existed but \nmanagement considered a reliable estimate could not be made. As we deem it to be \nnecessary we also instruct third party legal experts to support an independent assessment \nofÂ possible outcomes of claims. \nWhere material settlements have occurred we have agreed these to settlement agreements \nbetween the company and the claimant. \nWe have assessed the level of provisioning and contingent liability disclosures, where relevant, \nin response to known claims. \nBased on the procedures\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
