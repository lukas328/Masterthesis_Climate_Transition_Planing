We are less likely \nto become aware of instances of non‑compliance with laws and regulations that are not \nclosely related to events and transactions reflected in the financial statements. Also, the risk \nof not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting \none resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, \nforgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion.\nOur audit testing might include testing complete populations of certain transactions and \nbalances, possibly using data auditing techniques. However, it typically involves selecting \na limited number of items for testing, rather than testing complete populations. We will often \nseek to target particular items for testing based on their size or risk characteristics. In other \ncases, we will use audit sampling to enable us to draw a conclusion about the population \nfrom which the sample is selected.\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located \non the FRC’s website at: www.frc. org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.
