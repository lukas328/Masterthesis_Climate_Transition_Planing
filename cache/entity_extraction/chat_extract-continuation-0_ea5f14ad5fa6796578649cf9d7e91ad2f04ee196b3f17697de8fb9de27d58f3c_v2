We will assess this area in more detail once the FRC issues \nmore guidance.\nIn 2022, the group refreshed its sustainability goals and 2030 targets. ESG data in annual \nreports is coming under increasing scrutiny as the investor community relies on it to evaluate \nthe value proposition of listed companies. We are conscious of the need for transparency, \naccuracy and the avoidance of overstating our performance in these measures. We reviewed \nthe group’s processes for ESG data management and independent assurance for the Task \nForce for Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The Committee also reviewed a final \nreport of JM’s 2022 sustainability audit, carried out by our internal audit team. The purpose \nwas to understand and review the processes for generating data for the products and services \nsustainability targets and metrics, and to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of any second \nline review controls. During the year, the Committee reviewed our Climate-related Assurance \nPlan for 2023. A workshop was held with management, internal audit and myself to define \nour longer term assurance expectation over its sustainability data, the output of which was \nreported to the Committee. This resulted in a sustainability assurance framework, and also \nclarified the roles and responsibilities of each of the Audit Committee and the Societal Value \nCommittee (SVC). The SVC oversees the delivery of our sustainability strategy and determines  \nthe related KPI’s to be reported, and the Audit Committee is responsible for the quality of the \ndata in the sustainability reporting.\nThe FRC’s Audit Quality Review (AQR) report, following inspection of PwC’s 2022 audit of JM, \nwas completed in early January 2023 and the Committee reviewed the detailed findings. \nFollowing receipt of the report, we discussed the findings with PwC, none of which were \nconsidered significant. Recommendations have been built into ongoing processes and the \nCommittee was satisfied with the external auditor’s commitment to audit quality, the robust \nand professional working relationship with management, and demonstration of strong \ntechnical knowledge. The Committee considered whether the report gave us any concern \nabout the quality of the 2022 audit and associated report, and we concluded that it did not.\nI am pleased that our internal committee effectiveness review this year confirmed that \nthe Committee continues to operate well and remains informed of relevant changes \nand developments in the external audit market. We have identified areas for further \nimprovement, including focusing on reviewing our fitness for purpose and approach; \nthe effectiveness and impact of the overall risk management framework and activity; \nand focusing on the future development and effectiveness of the internal audit function.\nDoug Webb\nAudit Committee Chair\nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 2023 95\nSTRATEGIC
