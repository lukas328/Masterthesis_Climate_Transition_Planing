in and \naround the workplace � \nThe 2022 fourth quarter survey achieved a response rate of 89 \npercent, a two percent increase from the 2021 end-year survey � In \nthe survey, we achieved an overall satisfaction and engagement \nscore (eSat) of 73, stable from 2021� The fourth quarter survey also \nshowed an increased employee net promoter score (eNPS) � Overall, \nmost of the scores in the survey improved, including areas such as \nempowerment, manager, feedback, growth, and recognition � The \nscore on decision making decreased by one point � Along with the \nsurvey scores, the
