Contributions by employees and by \nGroup companies were paid into separate funds administered by a corporate trustee. Following the closure of this \nscheme to future accrual, existing members retain any ongoing salary link, with future benefits payable dependent \nupon member salary at the date of leaving or retirement. Any current employees who were members of The Bupa \nPension Scheme were automatically enrolled into the defined contribution pension scheme, the My Bupa LifeSight \nPlan from 1 January 2021. \nThe recognised surplus in relation to The Bupa Pension Scheme is limited to the present value of any future refunds \nfrom the scheme in the event of a wind up. There are no minimum funding requirements in place and the Trustees \ndo not have the unilateral power to trigger a wind up of the scheme. Once all members have left the scheme, the \nGroup can wind up the scheme and is entitled to any remaining surplus. \nContributions by Group companies to this scheme have been made in accordance with the recommendations of \nthe independent scheme actuary. \nThe independent scheme actuary for The Bupa Pension Scheme performs detailed triennial valuations together \nwith annual interim reviews. Both triennial and interim valuations use the attained age method, recognising the \nclosure of the scheme to new entrants. \nThe latest triennial valuation, dated 1 July 2020, showed that The Bupa Pension Scheme was in surplus on its \ntechnical provisions basis. The scheme was also in surplus on the more prudent actuarial basis which the Trustees \nuse to set their long-term funding target. As a result, no deﬁcit reduction contributions are currently due. This \nposition could change as a result of future valuations. \nThere are several other smaller deﬁned beneﬁt pension schemes operated by UK and overseas subsidiaries. The \ndeﬁned beneﬁt pension schemes are assessed by independent scheme actuaries in accordance with UK or local \npractice and under IAS 19 as at 31 December 2022 for the purposes of inclusion in the Group’s Consolidated \nFinancial Statements. \nTrustees are appointed for each scheme as determined by its respective trust documentation and Trustees are \nrequired to act in the best interests of the schemes’ beneficiaries. The long-term investment objectives of the \nTrustees and the employers are to limit the risk of the assets failing to meet the liabilities of the schemes over the \nlong term, and to maximise returns consistent with an acceptable level of risk. \nThe smaller defined benefit pension schemes are not individually material to the Group on a net surplus/deficit \nbasis, but details have been disclosed within the subsidiary financial statements of the relevant sponsoring \nemployer of each scheme. \nBupa Annual Report 2022 156 \n  \n              \n                    \n              \n                  \n      \n                    \n                \n                    \n                    \n   \n    \n              \n                   \n                   \n              \n    \n \n \n  \n \n                \n                \n                \n                \n              \n      \n     \n     \n      \n    \n          \n \n \n  \n \n               \n              \n                 \n                 \n     \n            \n             \n             \n               \n          \n      \n   \nStrategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements \nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \ncontinued \nUnfunded schemes \nUnfunded defined benefit pension arrangements exist for certain former employees to provide benefits in \naddition to the funded pension arrangements provided by the Group. There are no separate funds or assets in the \nConsolidated Statement of Financial Position to support the unfunded schemes; however, cash deposits included \nin the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position in respect of these liabilities and assets are ring-fenced to \nsupport these liabilities (see Note 8). \nThe latest valuation of these arrangements was performed as at 31 December 2022 under IAS 19 by the Group’s \nindependent actuary. The charge to the Consolidated Income Statement in respect of these arrangements and the \nassessment of the related pension liability as at 31 December 2022 have been made in accordance with this latest \nvaluation, which used the same principal assumptions as adopted as at 31 December 2022 under IAS 19 for The \nBupa Pension Scheme. \nPost-retirement medical benefit scheme \nThe Group also provides unfunded post-retirement medical benefits for certain former employees. These benefits \nwere granted under an agreement which closed to new entrants in 1992. The latest valuation of this scheme was \nperformed on 31 December 2022 by an actuary employed by the Group using the same principal assumptions as \nadopted as at 31 December 2022 under IAS 19 for The Bupa Pension Scheme.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
