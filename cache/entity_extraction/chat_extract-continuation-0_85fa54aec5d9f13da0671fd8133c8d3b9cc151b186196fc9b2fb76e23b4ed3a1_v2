Aligned with our \napproach to a just and inclusive transition, it is our preference that \nwe engage with companies to work with them to overcome such \nchallenges. Part of this approach is reflecting the nuances of country \ndecarbonisation pathways, which may take place at different paces \nand via different mechanisms than the global decarbonisation \npathways typically utilised by international standards. \nDuring 2022, as part of our ongoing review of our climate targets, we \nundertook an internal review of the Science Based Targets initiative \n(SBTi) and engaged with the SBTi to understand their view of the \nmethodology’s application in emerging markets. The SBTi uses \nglobal decarbonisation targets and pathways for their verification \nwhich do not distinguish between the differing needs for emerging \nmarkets and developed markets. Aligned with our approach to a just \nand inclusive transition, we believe it is critical that we engage \nwith countries and companies to work with them to overcome \ntheir transition challenges. A part of this approach is reflecting the \nnuances of the challenges faced by specific countries, for example \nin balancing economic growth and decarbonisation. This leads to \ndifferences in pace of decarbonisation as accepted in the Paris \nagreement through the ‘common but differentiated responsibilities’ \nprinciple, which we try to integrate in our Responsible Investment \napproach and articulated in our Just and Inclusive Transition paper. \nWe continue to engage with the SBTi and monitor its publications to \nexplore how the methodology can be appropriately applied in our \nmarkets, in a manner that is consistent with the needs of emerging \nmarkets and our broader philosophy.\nWe will maintain a watching brief on the suitability and ambition \nof our climate targets, while both continuing to hold ourselves to \naccount as a large asset owner and maintaining our approach to \na just and inclusive transition.\n 11\nPrudential plc Climate Transition Plan  \nImplementation and \nengagement strategy\nTo deliver our net zero commitment we will focus on the areas \nwhere we can have the biggest impact, using our influence as \nan asset owner and asset manager.  \nWe aim to do this while prioritising a just and inclusive transition in \nline with our ESG strategy and overall business model. We believe \nthat it is critical to respond to the challenge of transitioning towards \na low carbon economy in a way that reflects both geographical and \nsectoral challenges, as well as considering the social implications of \nour plans. Prudential is focused on real-world impact that is \nmeaningful for our stakeholders.  \nGiven the cross-functional strategy required to support the climate \ntransition, we are coordinating our efforts across four key areas: \n> Our responsible investment activities; \n> Our products and services;\n> Industry engagement and advocacy; and\n> Within our own operations.\nAs an asset owner, the most significant lever we can utilise for \nportfolio decarbonisation is our  responsible investment activity. \nBy focusing our energy and resources in this area we can have the \nmost material and real-world impact, and our engagement and \nimplementation strategy reflects this. \nWhile full progress on our overall ESG, climate and Responsible \nInvestment strategies can be found in our 2022
