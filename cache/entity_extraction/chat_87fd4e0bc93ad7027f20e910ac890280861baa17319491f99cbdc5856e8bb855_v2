Closing rate of Turkish lira applied to average rate following the application of IAS 29. Refer to Note 1.7 for details. \nForeign exchange hedging activities \nThe Group manages its exposure to foreign exchange risk by entering into hedging transactions using derivative \nfinancial instruments. The Group applies fair value, cash flow and net investment hedge accounting. \nThe hedging relationship between a hedging instrument and a hedged item is formally documented. \nDocumentation includes the risk management objectives and the strategy in undertaking the hedge transaction. \n(a) Fair value hedges \nWhere a derivative financial instrument hedges the change in fair value of a recognised asset or liability or an \nunrecognised firm commitment, any gain or loss on remeasurement of the hedging instrument at fair value is \nrecognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. The hedged item is fair valued for the hedged risk with any \ngain or loss on remeasurement being recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. \n(b) Cash flow hedges \nWhere a derivative financial instrument hedges the change in cash flows related to a recognised asset or liability, \nor a highly probable forecast transaction, it is accounted for as a cash flow hedge. \nThe effectiveness of a cash flow hedge is the degree to which the cash flows attributable to a hedged risk are \noffset by changes in the cash flows of the hedging instrument. The effective portion of any gain or loss on the \nhedging instrument is recognised directly in other comprehensive income until the forecast transaction occurs, \ni.e. when a hedged interest payment is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement, the related hedging \ngain or loss is also recycled to the Consolidated Income Statement, and when a hedged business combination \nis recognised, the hedging gain or loss is also recycled to goodwill in the Consolidated Statement of Financial \nPosition. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss is always recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. \nIf the hedged cash flow is no longer expected to take place, all deferred gains and losses are released to the \nConsolidated Income Statement immediately. If the hedging instrument or hedge relationship is terminated \nbut the hedged transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in other \ncomprehensive income and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs. \nIn 2021, a correction to the cash flow hedge reserve of £21m was recognised. The cash flow hedge reserve related \nto hedging of acquisitions and should have been reallocated to goodwill (£20m) and investments in associates \n(£1m) on initial application of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments. As at 31 December 2022, the cash flow hedge reserve \namounts to £nil (2021: £nil). \n(c) Net investment hedging \nThe Group hedges appropriate levels of its net asset exposures after taking into consideration key regulatory \nand financial metrics. To hedge the currency risk, the group designates the forward element of foreign currency \nforward and swap contracts as hedging instruments. The Group hedges the net investments only to the extent \nof the notional amount of the foreign exchange leg of the hedging derivative. \nChanges in the fair value of the hedging instrument are initially recognised in other comprehensive income to \nthe extent that the hedge is effective. Exchange differences arising on the consolidation of these net assets are \ndeferred in equity until the foreign operation is disposed of or liquidated, when the differences are then recognised \nin the Consolidated Income Statement as part of the gain or loss\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
