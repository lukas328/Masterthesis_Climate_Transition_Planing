available and economically \nfeasible recycling routes for EOL blades � We are supporting the \nproject by developing materials and value streams for three recycling \nroutes� The recycling technologies will undergo a complete lifecycle \nanalysis and mapping of global warming potential � The project runs \nfor three years and is partly funded by Innovation Fund Denmark (IFD)�\nSupplier engagement \nIn addition to reducing waste in our own operations, we are also \ncommitting to a 50 percent decrease in the waste intensity of our \nsupply chain by 2030 � We are asking our strategic suppliers, \ncovering nearly 50 percent of procurement spend, to report on their \nwaste generation, and to set waste reduction targets for themselves \nand their own suppliers � Those that do so are granted a Vestas \nCertificate of Circularity Commitment � As we expect our supply \nchain to consolidate in the coming years, suppliers that partner with \nus on our sustainability journey will be highly valued � \nIn the first quarter of 2022, we asked 48 of our strategic suppliers \nto report on their waste generation, set waste reduction targets for \ntheir own operations, and by the end of 2024, set waste reduction \ntargets for their suppliers � We expect these initiatives to trigger a \ncascade of waste reductions through our value chain � At the \nyear-end, 40 strategic suppliers had officially contributed to our \ncircularity commitments and been awarded a Vestas Supplier \nCertificate of Circularity Commitment � We actively continue to \nengage with suppliers on the waste reduction journey through our \nregular supplier meetings with key accounts � \n35\nVestas Sustainability Report 2022\nEnvironmentIn brief General Governance Sustainability dataSocial Appendix\nCircular economy\nOperational circularity \nRepair and refurbishment \nAcross our operations, we are committed to expanding our efforts  \nto refurbish and reuse turbine components, while regionalising our\nrepair and refurbishment infrastructure where possible � Through\nrefurbishment, we can reuse up to 70 percent of component \nmaterials, and emit 45 percent less CO 2e than manufacturing a  \nnew component, even after considering the emisisons involved  \nin transportation �\nThe major components of our turbines are already largely refur -\nbished and reutilised � However, our roadmap commits us to achieve\n55 percent total refurbished component utilisation by 2030 and 75\npercent by 2040, mostly by creating new repair loops for minor\ncomponents � This will lead to further waste reduction, lower carbon\nemissions, and local job creation �\nIn 2022, we achieved a total refurbished component utilisation rate\nof 17 percent, an improvement of 2 percent year-on-year � The parts \nwe currently refurbish are primarily main components, such as \nblades, generators, gearboxes, main shafts, with some minor \ncomponents included as well � We also significantly improved the \nrefurbished component utilisation rate on a number of component \ncategories � For example, we achieved a refurbished component \nutilisation rate of 71 percent for blades, an improvement of 8 \npercent year-on-year � \nMoving forward, we will continue to expand our repair capabilities to \ninclude additional minor components, and regionalise our refurbish -\nment infrastructure to improve the business case and sustainability \nimpact of refurbishment �\nMaterial recovery \nEliminating landfilling and incineration \nWe have committed to reduce the amount of manufacturing waste \ngoing to landfill to less than 1 percent, waste incinerated to less than \n1 percent, and waste incinerated with energy recovery to less than 5 \npercent, all by 2030 � As most of our internal waste is centralised in \nmanufacturing facilities, these targets go hand-in-hand with \nimproving our material efficiency � However, we are not only focusing \non our manufacturing waste � \nAll of our functional areas - including manufacturing, construction, \nand service - will begin by mapping out their waste streams � As part \nof this process, they will identify priority projects to divert from \nlandfill as quickly as possible, with the majority of landfill reductions \nplanned to occur before 2025 � As we decrease landfilling and \nincineration, we will increase our recycling rate to more than 94 \npercent by 2030� This marks a significant increase from our present \nrecycling rate of 55 percent �\nIn 2022, we landfilled 7 percent of our internal waste, incinerated 38 \npercent, and recycled 55 percent � Please refer to Selected environ -\nmental data and SASB disclosure for the absolute amounts of waste \nproduced by our operations in 2021, along with the breakdown of \nmaterial classes used � \nDuring the year, waste generation within our service business \ndecreased compared to our activity levels � In manufacturing, waste \ngeneration decreased relatively less than production levels � It should \nbe noted that the overall environmental performance of our \nmanufacturing facilities varies globally � These fluctuations are \nlinked to local infrastructure, turbine variants and the frequency \nwith which these variants are introduced � In 2022, we activated our \ngovernance structure to introduce our new circularity targets, \ncovering the entire value chain � For example, we worked with \nsustainability module leads responsible for developing and \nimplementing circularity initiatives and targets for each turbine part � \nWe also utilised a regionalised HSE structure to introduce year-on-\nyear recycling targets for each of our factories � \nCircularity implementation and governance \nTo support our overall sustainability strategy, we have embedded \nthe Vestas Circularity Roadmap throughout our organisation – from \nour engineers designing new turbines, to our factories manufactur -\ning components, to our workers across our global supply chain � \nNearly every functional area within Vestas has a part\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model":
