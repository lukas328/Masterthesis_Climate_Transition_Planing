See page 66 for \nthe Board’s conclusion on the Group’s risk management \nand internal control environment during 2022. However, \nwe are considering whether our internal control system \ncould be further strengthened in response to aspects of \nthe Reforms which may not be mandatory for Bupa but \nwith which we may choose to comply. The Committee \nhas asked management to ensure that the IMS is utilised \nas much as possible in any activity to strengthen our \ninternal controls (see the Risk Committee report on \npage 73 for more details of the IMS). \nThe FRC’s new Draft Minimum Standard for Audit \nCommittees is being reviewed and the Committee will \nconsider appropriate changes to its terms of reference \nwhen the final standard is published. \nGroup Internal Audit (GIA) \nThe assurance provided by GIA is an important part of \nthe Committee’s consideration of Bupa’s overall control \nenvironment. Further details on the role of GIA and its \nwork during the year are available in the Bupa’s system \nof governance section on page 64, and information on \nthe Group’s RMF can be found in the Bupa’s system of \ngovernance section on page 63. During 2022, the \nCommittee interaction with GIA included: \n▪ Reviewing regular reports from the CAO covering \nGIA’s progress towards completing its 2022 Global \nAssurance Plan, findings from GIA assurance activity \nand the effectiveness of management’s actions in \nresponding to these findings, and insights relating \nto root causes of findings and thematic issues – \nall of which help the Committee to monitor the \neffectiveness of risk management and control \nacross the Group \n▪ Reviewing the Group’s integrated report on the \nongoing effectiveness of Bupa’s systems of internal \ncontrol and risk management, including the \nCAO’s opinion \n▪ Reviewing and approving GIA’s risk-based 2023 \nGlobal Assurance Plan and budget (2023 Plan). The \nCommittee is satisfied that GIA has the appropriate \nresources and ways of working to achieve its \n2023 Plan. \nGIA’s effectiveness is assessed internally each year, \nwith an external quality assessment at least every five \nyears. In 2022 the Committee commissioned an external \nquality assessment of GIA to assess its effectiveness \nand compliance with the Global Institute of Internal \nAuditors’ international standards (the Standards) \nand the FS Code. The external assessor presented \nthe results to the Committee in January 2023. They \nreported that GIA met a high level of conformance with \nthe Standards and the FS Code. The Committee agreed \nwith the external assessor that GIA is an effective, \ninnovative, well-respected and valued function that \nfocuses its work in the right areas of the business, \nand delivers high-quality assurance outcomes. \nThe Committee clarified areas for ongoing future \ndevelopment which are in line with GIA’s strategy, \nincluding: embedding data-led analytics assurance \ncapabilities, executing its digital strategy, and further \nevolving principles-based assurance methodology. \nThe Committee noted the recommended enhancements \nand that GIA had plans in place to implement these \nduring 2023. \nChief Audit Officer \nThe Committee is responsible for the appointment and \nremoval of the CAO and, through the Chair, sets the \nCAO’s objectives and reviews their performance, taking \ninto account the views of the Group CEO. The CAO has \naccess to the Committee Chair and Board Chairman as \nrequired and is directly accountable to the Committee. \nThe current CAO has been in role since August 2019. \nI held regular meetings with the CAO throughout \nthe year, and the CAO met in private with the full \nCommittee twice without management being present. \nExternal Auditor \nDuring the year, the Committee assessed the \nperformance of PwC in conducting the audit of \nthe 2021 Annual Report which was its first year of \nengagement as External Auditor. The assessment was \ncarried out using questionnaires sent to Committee \nmembers, standing attendees and the chairs of the \naudit committees of the Group’s major insurance \nsubsidiaries. Overall, the Committee agreed that the \naudit had been effective and of good quality with \nPwC providing good challenge to management on \naccounting policies and key issues and judgements. \nHowever, the audit had been delivered later than \nplanned, leading to a delay in announcement of the \nGroup’s 2021 Full Year Results. The Committee \nacknowledged that the first audit was more complex \nthan usual for a variety of reasons. However, the \nCommittee felt that this outcome could have been \navoided if there had been greater visibility of the \nprogress of the audit during the process. PwC \nacknowledged the complications that arose during its \nfirst audit of Bupa and had met with management to \nagree what steps could be taken for the 2022 audit \nto avoid a recurrence of this situation. \nIn the interest of safeguarding the independence of \nthe External Auditor, Bupa complies with the relevant \nregulatory requirements and the FRC’s Ethical Standard \nfor auditors, relating to the provision of non-audit \nservices by the External Auditor. The Committee \nmonitors compliance with Bupa’s Non-Audit Services \nPolicy and all non-audit service engagements entered \ninto with PwC in 2022 were approved in compliance \nwith the requirements of this policy. This included the \nengagement to provide limited assurance over Bupa’s \n2021 GHG Emissions Report being approved by the \nCommittee\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
