However, it has the potential to quantify the\nsustainability benefit of our products and solutions and thereby \nsupport our customers in delivering their net zero targets.\nBecause it’s a comparative rather than absolute measure, quantifying\nscope 4 benefit is complex. So we are using a data-driven approach, \ndevised by internal and external subject matter experts, and which we\nintend to have validated by a third party. This will underpin two value\ndrivers for Weir.\nFirstly, our scope 4 emissions data will become part of an enhanced\nand compelling customer value proposition, additive to total cost \nof ownership (TCO) benefits. For customers, we are turning TCO into\n'TCO-squared' by adding CO2e benefit to the mix.\nSecondly, while the UK taxonomy has yet to be established, our \nrobust approach creates potential for a larger proportion of our sales \nto be classified as green revenues as we quantify the substantive\nCO2e savings of our products in use at customer sites versus \nalternative technologies.\nMEASUREMENT AND DISCLOSURE\nWe publish scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions on pages 54 to 55 in this 2022\nAnnual Report. Changes in the assumptions underpinning these\ncalculations can have a substantial effect on the outcome. For \nexample, in accordance with the GHG Protocol: Corporate Accounting\nand Reporting Standard, for each Weir machine sold in the accounting\nyear, we have calculated emissions based on power consumption\nover the lifetime of the equipment – typically the life of the mine on\nwhich it operates. So we are committed to collaborating with our \nsupply chain partners and customers to further develop a consistent \napproach for reporting, target setting and progress tracking across \nour industry.\nIn line with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, we continue to review our \nreporting in the light of any changes in business structure, calculation\nmethodology and the accuracy or availability of data. As a result, we\nhave re-stated 2021 scope 3 emissions to reflect changes in\nmethodology and data. Due to recognised inherent uncertainties in\ncalculating scope 3, we have adopted a continuous improvement \napproach.We will continue to review our processes and disclose any \nrestatements in a timely and transparent manner.\nStrategic Report Governance Financial Statements Additional Information\nSUSTAINABILITY REVIEW\nOUR EMISSIONS STRATEGY\nThe Weir Group PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2022 50\nOUR TRANSITION PLAN\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
