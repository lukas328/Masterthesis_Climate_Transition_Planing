The assets \nare not depreciated or amortised while they are classified as held for sale.  \nAn impairment loss is recognised in the Income Statement for any initial or subsequent write-\ndown of the asset or disposal group to fair value less costs to sell. A gain is recognised for any \nsubsequent increases in fair value less costs to sell of an asset or disposal group, but not in \nexcess of any cumulative impairment loss previously recognised. A gain or loss not previously \nrecognised by the date of the sale of the non-current asset (or disposal group) is recognised at \nthe date of de-recognition. \nA discontinued operation is a component of the group’s business that either has been disposed \nof, or that is classified as held for sale and represents a separate major line of business or \ngeographical area of operations, is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of a separate \nmajor line of business or geographical area of operations or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively \nwith a view to resale. \nClassification as a discontinued operation occurs at the earlier of disposal or when the \noperation meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale. The results of discontinued \noperations are presented separately in the Income Statement. When an operation is classified \nas a discontinued operation, the comparative Income Statement and Statement of Total \nComprehensive Income is restated as if the operation had been discontinued from the start of \nthe comparative year. \nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 2023 155\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION\nNotes on the Accounts continued for the year ended 31st March 2023 \n156 \n1 Accounting policies continued \nSources of estimation uncertainty \nDetermining the carrying amounts of certain assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date \nrequires estimation of the effects of uncertain future events. In the event that actual outcomes \ndiffer from those estimated, there may be an adjustment to the carrying amounts of those \nassets and liabilities within the next financial year. Other significant risks of material \nadjustment are the valuation of the liabilities of the defined benefit pension plans and tax \nprovisions. The group and parent company have considered the refining process and \nstocktakes, deferred tax assets and climate change and, whilst not deemed to represent a \nsignificant risk of material adjustment to the group’s and parent company’s financial position \nduring the year ending 31st March 2023, represent important accounting estimates. \nGoodwill, other intangibles and other assets \nThe group and parent company have significant intangible assets from both business \nacquisitions and investments in new products and technologies. Some of those acquisitions \nand investments are at an early stage of commercial development and, therefore, carry a \ngreater risk that they will not be commercially viable. Goodwill and intangible assets not yet \nready for use are not amortised, but are subject to annual impairment reviews. Other \nintangible assets are amortised from the time they are first ready for use and, together with \nother assets, are assessed for impairment when there is a triggering event that provides \nevidence that they are impaired. \nThe impairment reviews require the use of estimates of future profit and cash generation \nbased on financial budgets and plans approved by management, generally covering a three-\nyear period and then extrapolated using long term growth rates, and the pre-tax discount \nrates used in discounting projected cash flows, see note 5. \nPost-employment benefits \nThe group’s and parent company’s defined benefit plans are assessed annually by qualified \nindependent actuaries. The estimate of the liabilities of the plans is based on a number of \nactuarial assumptions. \nThere is a range of possible values for each actuarial assumption and the point within that \nrange is estimated to most appropriately reflect the group’s and parent company’s \ncircumstances. Small changes in these assumptions can have a significant impact on the \nestimate of the liabilities of the plans. A description of those discount rate and inflation \nassumptions, together with sensitivity analysis, is set out in note 24 to the group and parent \ncompany accounts. \nTax provisions \nTax provisions are determined based on the tax laws and regulations that apply in each of the \njurisdictions in which the group operates. Tax provisions are recognised where the impact of \nthose laws and regulations is unclear and it is probable that there will be a tax adjustment \nrepresenting a future outflow of funds to a tax authority or a consequent adjustment to the \ncarrying value of a tax asset. \nProvisions are measured using the best estimate of the most likely amount, being the most \nlikely amount in a range of possible outcomes. The resolution of tax positions taken by the \ngroup can take a considerable period of time to conclude and, in some cases, it is difficult to \npredict the outcome. Group current income tax liabilities at 31st March 2023 of £106 million \n(2022: £97 million) include tax provisions of £97 million (2022: £103 million) and the \nestimation of the range of possible outcomes is an increase in those liabilities by £66 million \n(2022: £83 million) to a decrease of £55 million (2022: £93 million).  The estimates made \nreflect where the group faces routine tax audits or is in ongoing disputes with tax authorities; \nhas identified potential tax exposures relating to transfer pricing; or is contesting the tax \ndeductibility of certain business costs. \nDeferred tax assets \nDeferred tax assets are recognised to the extent it is probable that future taxable profits will be \navailable, against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilised, based on \nmanagement’s assumptions relating to future taxable profits. \nDetermination of future taxable profits requires application of judgement and estimates,\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HELD FOR SALE<|>organization<|>Liabilities classified as held for sale are assets that are intended to be disposed of within a year, presented separately on the Balance Sheet, and are not depreciated or amortised while classified as held for sale)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IMPAIRMENT LOSS<|>organization<|>Recognised in the Income Statement for any initial or subsequent write-down of an asset or disposal group to fair value less costs to sell)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FAIR VALUE<|>organization<|>The estimated market value of an asset or disposal group, used to determine impairment or gains upon sale)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INCOME STATEMENT<|>organization<|>Financial statement that reports a company's revenues, expenses, gains, and losses, including impairment losses and gains from fair value adjustments)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DISCONTINUED OPERATION<|>organization<|>A component of the group’s business that has been disposed of or classified as held for sale, representing a major line of business or geographical area, with results presented separately in the Income Statement)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOHNSON MATTHEY<|>organization<|>A global specialty chemicals company that publishes annual reports and accounts, including notes on accounting policies and estimates)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023<|>organization<|>The financial report published by Johnson Matthey for the year ending 31st March 2023, containing financial statements and notes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY<|>organization<|>Refers to the uncertainties involved in estimating the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities due to future events and assumptions, impacting financial reporting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOODWILL<|>organization<|>An intangible asset arising from business acquisitions, subject to annual impairment reviews if not yet ready for use)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTANGIBLE ASSETS<|>organization<|>Assets such as patents, trademarks, or proprietary technology, which are evaluated for impairment and amortised when ready for use)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS<|>organization<|>Liabilities related to defined benefit pension plans, assessed annually by actuaries, based on actuarial assumptions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TAX PROVISIONS<|>organization<|>Liabilities recognized for uncertain tax positions, based on applicable laws, regulations, and management estimates of outcomes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEFERRED TAX ASSETS<|>organization<|>Assets recognized when future taxable profits are probable, allowing the use of deductible temporary differences based on management’s assumptions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FUTURE TAXABLE PROFITS<|>organization<|>Projected profits used to determine the recoverability of deferred tax assets, relying on estimates and judgments\")\n##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
