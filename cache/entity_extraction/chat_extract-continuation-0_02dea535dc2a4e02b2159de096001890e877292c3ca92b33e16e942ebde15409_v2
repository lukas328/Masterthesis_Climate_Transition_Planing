Substitute where possible:  \nRenewable energy strategy\nWe generate or procure 100% renewable \nelectricity across all our occupied premises. \nOur approach to renewable energy is governed \nby a hierarchy, designed to maximise the benefits \nof the renewable energy we purchase and use. \nIn the first instance, we determine opportunities for \ngenerating energy directly from our operational \nsites by assessing all renewable and low-carbon \ntechnologies available (e.g. microgeneration and \npassive renewable systems). Where we cannot \ngenerate our own energy or where the energy \nwe generate is insufficient for the entire building, \nwe procure renewable energy. \nPower purchase agreements (‘PPA’) are our \npreferred option, because they provide a reliable \nway of decarbonising our electricity consumption \nand also enable investment in new renewable \nenergy generation capacity. These are followed \nby high-quality renewable contracts backed by \nRenewable Energy Guarantees Origin (‘REGO’) \ncertificates, with standard green tariffs being the \nleast preferable options.\nAt present we procure approximately 24.1GWh \n(100%) of our building electricity from high-quality \nrenewable sources, which is why our Scope 2 \nemissions are significantly lower than the location-\nbased emissions. Whilst this is our second \npreferred option of procurement, we are actively \ninvestigating options for PPAs as part of our future \nenergy procurement strategies. \n4. Compensate for what is left:  \nUse of carbon credits \nFor residual operational emissions, we aim to \npurchase ‘high quality’ carbon credits generated \nfrom carbon removal projects. High quality relates \nto additionality, permanence and verifiability – \ndefined by Oxford Principles and others as carbon \ncredits earned from projects that sequester carbon \nfrom the atmosphere either through nature-based \nsolutions (‘NbS’), natural climate solutions (‘NCS’), \nor technology-based solutions.\nThe carbon removal credits that we will purchase \nand that are generated from NbS/NCS projects \ncan also deliver important environmental and \nsocial co-benefits in addition to carbon \nsequestration. We will adopt the Core Carbon \nPrinciples (‘CCP’) as developed by the Integrity \nCouncil for the Voluntary Carbon Market \n(‘ICVCM’), to assess and ensure the quality of \nour carbon removal credits. We will apply the \nVerified Carbon Standards (‘VCS’) and Climate, \nCommunity and Biodiversity Standards (‘CCB’) \nas a minimum to verify the quality of the carbon \nremoval credits we purchase, and we regularly \nreview this approach against emerging \nbest practice.\nTo date we have not directly bought any carbon \nremoval credits to offset our emissions and intend \nto reduce our carbon emissions by as much as \npossible from our 2019 baseline before we begin \nto purchase and retire any credits. At present we \nhave reduced our carbon intensity per FTE by \n80% overall and absolute emissions by 59% from \nour 2019 baselines. As such, we are in a position to \nstart considering carbon removal credits as the \nnext step in our net zero journey. \nAs part of our natural gas procurement contract, \nour supplier has purchased approximately 1,994 \nGold Standard carbon credit offsets on our behalf. \nThese have been reported separately and we do \nnot count them towards our net zero targets.\nCarbon credit definitions:\nAdditionality –  offsets represent an emission \nreduction or carbon removal relative to a \ncounterfactual baseline that would not have \ntaken place but for the offsetting activity \nPermanence – refers to how long a \ngreenhouse gas stays out of the atmosphere, \nwhether stored in a physical reservoir  \nor whose emission was deferred  \nthrough avoidance \nVerifiable – ensures that the emission \nreduction or carbon removal actually takes \nplace, and that all forms of double-counting, \nincluding double-claiming of the emission \nreduction benefit, are avoided \nNature-based solutions –  Activities that aim \nto protect, manage, enhance, and restore \nnature to address challenges and include \nre/afforestation, soil carbon sequestration \nand biochar \nNatural climate solutions – conservation, \nrestoration and improved land management \nactions that increase carbon storage or avoid \ngreenhouse gas emissions in landscapes and \nwetlands across the globe \nTechnology-based solutions – provide \npermanent removal and artificial\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PHOENIX GROUP
