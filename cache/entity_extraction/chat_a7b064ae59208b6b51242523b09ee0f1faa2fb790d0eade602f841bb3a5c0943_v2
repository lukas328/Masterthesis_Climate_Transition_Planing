The projected energy consumption reduction is 50 KWh \nper ton of PVC produced and 8,000 tons of CO2e in 2021.\nProcess improvements also include Alphagary’s Altamira I plasticizers plant, where installation and commissioning of \nan alcohol stripping column resulted in an 83%-time reduction, obtaining low alcohol concentrations in plasticizers in \nless than 40 minutes and a reduction of steam consumption of 20% compared with the previous process. As a result, \nAlphagary will stop consuming 5,500 ton/year of steam, which translates to a reduction of 1,000 tons CO2e/year.\nAdditionally, Dura-Line joined the U.S. Department of Energy’s Better Plants Program to improve energy productivity \nby 25% over a ten-year period. The first assessments conducted in 2021 revealed the opportunity to reduce nearly  \n1 million KWh through plant improvements. The teams will implement these robust energy improvements and system \noptimizations in 2022. \nLow impact & resilient \noperations\nDecarbonizing our operations \nEach Orbia business group has targets to improve \nefficiency and transition to cleaner or renewable sources \nof energy and obtain or maintain a certified environmental \nmanagement system. Related strategies include several \nplants, which have developed plans to adapt to potential \nextreme weather events. Climate-related risks have \ninfluenced our global targets to become carbon neutral \nby 2050 (reducing Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 47% by \n2030, pending validation by the SBTi) and to have all plants \ncertified as ISO-14001 or equivalent by 2025.\nIntroduction Governance Strategy Risk Management Metrics and Targets\nOrbia 2021 Climate Report\n17\nIncrease in post-consumer recycled content\nWavin aims to increase the use of post-consumer recycled plastics up to 25% by 2025 to reduce dependence on \nvirgin raw materials and consequently reduce carbon emissions in their value chain. The company has also set a goal \nof increasing the recyclability of its products by 90% by 2025. Similarly, Netafim has a target of increasing recycled \ncontent in drip lines up to 45% by 2030. These are key targets for integrating circularity into our business strategy. \nPurchased goods and services (category 1) represent around 6% of Orbia’s total Scope 3 emissions. \nTake-back programs\n \nDura-Line and Netafim have been operating take-back programs for a number of years. In 2021, Netafim expanded its \nprogram from four to eight countries (U.S., Australia, Israel, France, Spain, T urkey, Peru and Mexico), with approximately \n13,000 tons of end-of-life driplines collected globally for reuse. In 2021, Dura-Line’s take-back program repurposed \n1,754 reels and diverted a quarter million pounds of scrap tape to be recycled. \nRefrigerant recovery\n \nKoura’s refrigerant recovery plant in Japan increased its processing capacity in 2021. The Mihara plant continues to \nimplement this successful recovery technology and practices to further reduce global warming impacts. During 2021, \napproximately 900 tons of refrigerants were recovered, avoiding around 1.7 million tons of GHG emissions. The site \nhas plans to further grow its recovery capacity in 2022.\nMitigating our impact across\nthe supply chain\nAs part of Orbia’s goals to reduce emissions from fossil \nfuels, our procurement and logistics teams continually \npursue options to deploy energy efficient technologies and \ntransportation alternatives. These opportunities include: \nswitching from road to rail transport, introducing take-back \nprograms, and sourcing recycled or bio-based materials \nwhen available.\nLow impact & resilient \noperations\nIntroduction Governance Strategy Risk Management Metrics and Targets\nOrbia 2021 Climate Report\n18\nAs demonstrated in our 2019 climate risk assessment, both physical and transition scenarios were used to \nanalyze our resilience to climate change. \nFor physical risks, we utilized IPCC’s RCP 8.5 scenario to assess the impact of water stress and drought, \ncyclones, extreme heat and cold, flooding, landslides and wildfires. For transition risks, we considered climate-\nrelated financial implications associated with carbon taxes, utility costs, and mandates on and regulation \nof existing products and services. This ensures our operations fully address the risks and opportunities of \nclimate change. \nAdditionally, we are conducting a more detailed analysis at operational sites, such as our Cartagena facility, \nthat have been affected by shifting rainfall patterns and its proximity to the sea. Cartagena collaborated \nwith hydrology and rainfall experts to develop a 50-year pattern analysis to incorporate the preventative \nand adaptive measures necessary to guarantee operational continuity. This will enable us to provide \nuninterrupted product supply to customers in the case of extreme rain events in the future. The time horizon \nconsidered was 25-50 years, relevant for the life of capital assets.\nOrbia acknowledges the ever-changing landscape of climate  science and how it influences our business \nstrategies. In order to better assess the challenges ahead of us, we plan to update our previous climate risk \nanalysis during 2022 with state-of-the-art scenarios incorporating new information, expanding our time \nhorizon and scope, beyond Business-As\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
