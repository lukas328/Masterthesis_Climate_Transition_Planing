Eligibility does not imply compliance with any green or \nsimilar taxonomy or standard. Finance without an arrangement fee is \nalready also through Lombard’s digital channel.\n 44NatWest Group plc | 2022 Climate-related Disclosures Report\nGovernance Strategy and Climate transition plan Risk Management and Scenario Analysis Metrics and TargetsIntroduction\nClimate transition plan: Financial system \nThe Financial system encompasses support for a broad range of financial institutions (FIs), including banks, asset managers, insurance companies, specialist finance \nand hedge funds across Commercial & Institutional, as well as offering investment opportunities to customers through our Asset Management function within \nPrivate Banking. Our climate ambition recognises the importance of mobilising the entire financial system to accelerate pace towards net zero. During 2022, we \nfocused on FI customers and the assets under management portfolio, to develop transition plans.\nFinancial Institutions (FIs):\nCOP26 highlighted the significant role FIs play to align private capital with global climate commitments. Regulators, \ninvestors and capital providers have continued to increase pressure on FIs to embed and evidence robust \nsustainability strategies. NatWest Group lending to this sector was £20.9 billion(1) as at 31 December 2022 \n(£20.1 billion as at 31 December 2021).\nKey products, services and business model changes to support decarbonisation:\n • A large part of FIs’ emissions relate to Scope 3 emissions from providing products and services to \ncustomers. Due to lack of granular availability of customer-level climate data, FIs are still developing \nmeasurement methodologies and capabilities to assess their Scope 3 emissions. As a result, the current \nestimate of Scope 1 and 2 emissions for FI customers is not reflective of the full emissions profile of these \ncustomers.\n • To support decarbonisation of this sector, we have focused on education and engagement within the sector \nto support aligning customers with net-zero trajectories. We are also working to develop a qualitative transition \nplan assessment for customers within this sector to assess the impact of their net-zero ambitions on future \nemissions profile. Refer to section 3.6. for customer decisioning framework and tools being developed. As these \ntools are developed and implemented, these are expected to support the identification of customer engagement \ninitiatives to enhance commercial propositions as well as informing balance sheet mechanisms to further embed \nclimate into decision-making.\n • Our suite of Climate and ESG products and services are key to support customers’ transition strategies. \nTeams across Commercial & Institutional collaborate to deliver a market-leading proposition to customers, to \ninfluence our customers’ decarbonisation journey and build deeper customer relationships.\n • Sustainable-linked lending for our Insurance and Private Finance customers acting as ESG coordinator \nfocused on decarbonisation pathways.\n • Thought leadership including RBS International launching the ‘Pressure is mounting’ research report, \nsurveying 125 industry influencers to understand the extent to which Alternative Investment Funds are adopting \nscience-based targets and the barriers blocking their path.\n • Provision of regulatory advisory translating ‘green taxonomies’ into product solutions and ESG ratings \nadvisory to assist our customers’ articulation of their climate ambitions.\n • Engaging with our FI customers on Carbonplace as a partner and/or participant.\nExternal dependencies to support transition:\n • There is a dependency on the availability of granular customer-level climate data to enable FI customers \nto assess their Scope 3 emissions as well as develop transition plans.\n • Enablers could potentially include the establishment of an industry-wide methodology for FI Scope 3 \nemissions accounting, as well as minimum reporting standards across all sectors.\nAsset management:\nRelates to investment products and services for retail customers across NatWest Group. Diversification across \nasset classes, sectors and countries plays an important role in our ability to provide suitable products for a broad \nrange of retail investors, helping us manage risks such as liquidity and volatility. Our funds and portfolios are \npredominantly invested in (third-party) funds with limited direct exposure to equities and bonds. Part of our role as \na globally diversified investor is to increase the speed at which companies are reducing their emissions and \ninvesting in climate solutions. As we invest in third-party funds, working with fund managers to align their products \nto a net-zero trajectory forms a core part of our Asset Management net-zero strategy.\nTotal NatWest Group AuM were £28.3 billion as at 31 December 2022 (£30.2 billion as at 31 December 2021).\nKey products, services and business model changes to support decarbonisation include:\nWe focus on aligning our funds and discretionary portfolios with a net-zero trajectory, seeking out funds that we \ndeem to have a credible plan to achieve net zero by 2050. We are working towards achieving our portfolio \nalignment targets, described in section 3.3, by: \n • Designing our Net Zero Investment Framework, which uses qualitative and quantitative data sourced from \nfund managers to assess the credibility of their net-zero strategy, related commitments and progress made \nagainst these. This complements our carbon reduction targets by identifying datapoints\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
