This expansion means that \naround 50% of our electricity consumption in Poland \nis now from renewable sources compared with c.42% \nin 2021. \n▪ Switching our Türkiye head office onto renewable\nelectricity. \n▪ Expanding the solar panel installations in our Spanish \ncare homes, and in our La Moraleja hospital in Madrid. \nAPAC \n▪ As also referenced on page 24, implementing a PPA\nin Australia which started the supply of renewable\nelectricity to all our Australian care homes and our\ncorporate offices in Melbourne and Sydney. \nSustainable products & services \nAs referenced on page 7, our 3x6 strategy includes \nthree ambition KPIs - one of which is for 60% of \ncustomers to actively interact with Bupa on our digital \nplatforms. As such, we are strengthening our digital \nhealth capabilities to reduce emissions while continuing \nto deliver customer-centric, high-quality healthcare. Our \nambition is to provide customers in all our geographies \naccess to a digital health solution that delivers primary \nand specialist virtual care, virtual health coaching and \nprevention, and virtual services for chronic conditions. \nTypically, digital interactions - whether for healthcare \ndelivery or managing a health insurance policy - are \nassociated with lower emissions by reducing emissions \nintensive activities within physical health provision. \nDigital healthcare also reduces the need for customer \ntravel to and from a health treatment. \nEducating our customers about the environmental \nimpact of their choices is also key so they can make \ninformed decisions. We are enhancing how we do this -\nfor example, in Spain, our business has launched a \ncarbon calculator which shows customers the amount \nof GHG emissions saved by opting for a digital \nconsultation or downloading a digital medical report \nrather than in-person appointment or printed report. In \n2022, around 771,000 digital consultations took place \nusing the Blua app, which has the potential to avoid up \nto 8,000 tCO2e from the prevention of unnecessary \npatient travel. \nIn addition, our health services business in Hong \nKong SAR was the first provider in the territory to \noffer virtual consultations and remote drug delivery \n– with over 11,000 virtual consultations delivered in\n2022.

We use the term sustainable \nhealthcare to describe a system that meets the health \nneeds of the present, without compromising the health \nof future generations – delivering high-quality care \nin an affordable way, while minimising the impact \non the environment. \nThere are a significant number of opportunities \nto reduce the environmental impact of care that \nwe fund and deliver, and in 2022 we identified \nsix initiatives to help provide direction and \nconsistency across our businesses around \nsustainable healthcare. These are: \n1. Reducing emissions associated with \nanaesthetic gases; \n2. Reducing waste associated with \nunnecessary PPE; \n3. Reducing medicines waste due to sub optimal \nprescribing and compliance; \n4. Reducing our environmental footprint \nrelated to sustenance (i.e. feeding patients \nand customers); \n5. Measuring the environmental benefits \nassociated with optimising care pathways; and \n6. Increasing the proportion of digital \ninteractions/appointments instead \nof face to face. \nIt is our expectation that these practical initiatives \nwill inspire, drive engagement and raise the profile of \nsustainable healthcare across Bupa, at the same time \nas generating thought leadership and demonstrating \nthe progress towards – and authenticity of – our \nsustainability ambitions. \nThe six initiatives were identified with our Business \nUnits in mind, with the following criteria applied during \nthe identification process: \n▪ Measurable – initiatives should generate robust \ndata around health and environment. \n▪ Material – initiatives should have a material and \nscalable impact in respect of our strategy. \n▪ Marketable – initiatives should support our external \nsustainability advocacy ambitions. \n▪ Manageable – initiatives should be simple to \nimplement and build on existing initiatives. \nThe six initiatives will be accompanied by \nimplementation toolkits, that include evidence, insights \nand example case studies, to facilitate the initiation of \nthese projects within our clinical settings, with the aim \nthat all six initiatives will be implemented across \ndifferent business units during 2023. \nMission Accelerate \nMission Accelerate aims to engage at least 500 start-\nups and other key innovation partners to deliver at least \none
