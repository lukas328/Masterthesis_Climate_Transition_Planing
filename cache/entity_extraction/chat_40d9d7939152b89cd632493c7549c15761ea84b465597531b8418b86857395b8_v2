early and robust engage-\nment with our steel suppliers, we \nintend to become a leading user of \nemissions-reduced steel, and part \nof the solution in the decarbonisa-\ntion of the steel value chain�\nRasmus Boizas - Senior Purchasing Manager, T ower Materials\nAccelerating the decarbonisation  \nof the steel industry is our single \ngreatest carbon reduction \nchallenge� \nSteel and iron make up between 80 and 90 per -\ncent of a wind turbine’s material mass, and com -\nprise around 50 percent of our Scope 3 emissions � \nWhile the lifecycle CO 2e emissions of electricity \nfrom wind generation are extremely small com -\npared to other generating sources, we nonethe -\nless seek to reduce our carbon footprint to net-ze -\nro, and this means finding ways to decarbonise the \nemissions produced during the raw material ex -\ntraction and refinement of steel � \nWe occupy a unique position in the transformation \nof the steel sector, since we not only consume the \nmaterial but also provide cost-competitive renew -\nable energy solutions � Renewable energy can be \nused to help decarbonise many hard to abate sec -\ntors using green hydrogen, including steel produc -\ntion� By collaborating with our suppliers and cus -\ntomers, we can use emissions-reduced steel to \nachieve our own Scope 3 emissions reduction tar -\nget while helping decarbonise the wider steel in -\ndustry with our sustainable energy solutions �\nWorryingly, despite mounting public pressure and \nthe increasing certainty of climate science, the car -\nbon intensity of steel production has remained un -\nchanged over the last two decades � Most projec -\ntions indicate that progress is not being made fast \nenough or at the scale necessary to achieve a \nnet-zero scenario� \nWhile we are pushing to accelerate the decarboni -\nsation of steel, further collaboration with the steel \nindustry and increased incentives for green steel \nproduction will be critical to achieving our goals � To \nhelp decarbonise steel production, we: \n• Incentivise the production of CO 2-reduced steel \nin partnership with our suppliers \n• Partner with suppliers in the creation and \nutilisation of green hydrogen and renewable \nelectricity to help decarbonise steel production \n• Invest in the development of alternative \nmaterials, such as wooden towers, to manufac -\nture our turbines\nAs part of our program to decarbonise steel pro -\nduction, we joined the World Economic Forum’s \nFirst Movers Coalition in May 2022, committing to \nprocure at least 10 percent near-zero emissions \nsteel by 2030 � Through this commitment, we are \nsending a strong demand signal to our steel suppli -\ners that we are eager for transformative changes in \nthe production of steel, and will prioritise working \nwith steel companies that invest in emissions-re -\nduced products � \n14\nVestas Sustainability Report 2022\nIn brief General GovernanceEnvironment Sustainability dataSocial Appendix\nA break-through in blade recycling \nTurbine blades have previously been challenging \nto recycle due to the chemical properties of epoxy \nresin, a resilient substance that was believed to be \nimpossible to break down into reusable compo -\nnents � This has led to many technology leaders \nattempting to replace or modify epoxy resin with \nalternatives that can be more easily treated � \nAlong with our partners, we now present a new \nsolution that renders epoxy-based turbine blades \nas circular, without the need to change the design \nor composition of blade material � Combining newly \ndiscovered chemical technology with industrial \nscale, the solution can be applied to blades cur -\nrently in operation � This will eliminate the need for \nblade redesign, or landfill disposal of epoxy-based \nblades when they are decommissioned �\nThe solution is enabled by a novel chemical pro -\ncess that can chemically break down epoxy resin \ninto virgin-grade materials � The chemical process \nwas developed in collaboration with Aarhus \nUniversity, Danish Technological Institute, and \nOlin, who are the partners of the CETEC (Circular \nEconomy for Thermosets Epoxy Composites) initi -\native, which is partly funded by the Innovation \nFund Denmark �\nScaling up the solution\nThrough a newly established value chain, supported \nby Nordic recycling leader Stena Recycling and glob-\nal epoxy manufacturer Olin, we will now focus on scal-\ning up the novel chemical disassembly process into \na commercial solution � Once mature, the solution \nwill signal the beginning of a circular economy for all \nexisting, and future epoxy-based turbine blades �\nFor several decades, producing wind turbine blades \nmanufactured with epoxy-based resin has been \nstandard practice in the wind industry � In the most \nmature markets for wind energy, the first turbines \nare reaching the end of their operational life, a num-\nber that will only increase over the coming years � \nWindEurope estimates around 25,000 tonnes of \nblades to reach the end of their operational life annu-\nally by 2025� \nBuilding a circular \neconomy for blades\nIn focus\nAlong with Aarhus University, Danish T echnological \nInstitute, Olin, and Stena Recycling, we developed  \na new solution that enables materials in epoxy-based \nturbine blades to be recovered and re-used, without \nrequiring a change in design�\n15\nVestas Sustainability Report 2022\nIn brief General GovernanceEnvironment Sustainability dataSocial Appendix\nAs the newly discovered process only uses widely \navailable chemicals, industrialisation can occur \nquickly and cost-efficiently � Once this new technol -\nogy is implemented at scale, legacy blade material
