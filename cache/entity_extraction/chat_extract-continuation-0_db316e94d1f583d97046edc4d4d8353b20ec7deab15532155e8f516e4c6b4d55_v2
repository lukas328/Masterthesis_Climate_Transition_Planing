The main return-\nseeking asset class in the scheme, including the underlying assets of the pooled investment funds, is credit; there \nis minimal remaining market risk from equities or property. The scheme’s liabilities will fluctuate in line with interest \nrates and inflation. The impact of increased bond yields, partially offset by higher inflationary expectations in the \nperiod, have led to the reduction in liabilities in the period. However, The Bupa Pension Scheme’s investment \nstrategy aims to hedge against interest and inflation risk as measured on a long-term funding basis, via a liability-\ndriven investment strategy that utilises a combination of high-quality gilts and swaps. This means that on a funding \nvaluation basis, assets will move broadly in the same direction as the liabilities, although this can differ under the \nIAS 19 valuation.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PENSION SCHEME<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A pension scheme providing post-retirement benefits, including unfunded medical benefits for certain former employees, with valuations and asset management details outlined in the annual report)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The parent organization managing the pension scheme and related benefits, responsible for scheme valuations and financial reporting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUPA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A healthcare organization that manages the pension scheme and provides post-retirement medical benefits, with detailed financial and actuarial data in the report)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ACTUARY<|>PERSON<|>An individual employed by the Group to perform the valuation of the pension scheme as of 31 December 2022, using IAS 19 standards)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>2022<|>EVENT<|>The year in which the latest valuation of the pension scheme was performed and financial data was reported)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>31 DECEMBER 2022<|>EVENT<|>The date of the latest valuation of the pension scheme conducted by the actuary)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>2021<|>EVENT<|>The previous year for which the pension scheme's financial data was reported, used for comparison)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>1,163 million GBP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Present value of funded obligations of the pension scheme in 2022, representing the estimated future payouts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>2,499 million GBP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Fair value of scheme assets in 2022, representing the investments backing the scheme obligations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>398 million GBP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Net assets of funded schemes in 2022, calculated as scheme assets minus obligations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>355 million GBP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Net recognized assets of the scheme in 2022, reflecting the scheme's net position after accounting for liabilities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>1,202 million GBP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Present value of unfunded obligations for post-retirement medical benefits in 2022, representing liabilities for unfunded benefits)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>1,206 million GBP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Total present value of obligations (funded and unfunded) in 2022 for the scheme)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Assets<|>GEO<|>The investments held by the pension scheme, including pooled funds, bonds, loans, cash, equities, and derivatives)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Pooled investment funds<|>GEO<|>Investment funds comprising 39% of scheme assets in 2022, managed to generate returns and diversify investments)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Corporate bonds<|>GEO<|>Debt securities constituting 33% of scheme assets in 2022, used as a stable investment component)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Loans<|>GEO<|>Loan investments making up 13% of scheme assets in 2022, providing fixed income returns)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Cash/other assets<|>GEO<|>Liquid assets and miscellaneous holdings accounting for 11% of scheme assets in 2022)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Government bonds<|>GEO<|>Government-issued bonds representing 6% of scheme assets in 2022, used for risk mitigation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Derivatives<|>GEO<|>Financial derivatives with a negative value in 2022, used for hedging interest rate and inflation risks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Equities<|>GEO<|>Stock investments comprising 1% of scheme assets in 2022, with minimal exposure to market risk)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>The Bupa Pension Scheme<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A defined benefit pension scheme managed by Bupa, with assets and liabilities detailed in the report, aiming to hedge against interest and inflation risks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IAS 19<|>EVENT<|>International Accounting Standard used for pension scheme valuation and accounting)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE GROUP<|>BUPA<|>Bupa is managed by The Group, which oversees the pension scheme and benefits<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BUPA<|>ACTUARY<|>An actuary employed by Bupa performed the scheme valuation as of 31 December 2022<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>2022<|>ACTUARY<|>The valuation was performed on 31 December 2022<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>2022<|>PENSION SCHEME<|>The latest valuation date for the pension scheme<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>2022<|>Assets<|>PENSION SCHEME<|>The scheme's assets at the end of 2022, valued at £1,561 million<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>2022<|>Obligations<|>PENSION SCHEME<|>The present value of obligations at the end of 2022, totaling £1,206 million<|>8)\n##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
