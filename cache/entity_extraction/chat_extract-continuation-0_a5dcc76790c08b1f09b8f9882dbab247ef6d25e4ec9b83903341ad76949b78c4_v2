We have also established an Environmental and Social \nManagement Policy for Financing and Investment Activity for the purpose of avoiding and mitigating adverse environmental and \nsocial impacts resulting from our financing and investment activity.19 The policy identifies industries and sectors that have a high \npossibility of contributing to adverse impacts (Figure 18). \n \nFigure 17: Positioning of our Environmental and Social Management Policy for Financing and Investment Activity \n \n \nFigure 18: Overview of our Environmental and Social Management Policy for Financing and Investment Activity \nEnvironmental and Social Management Policy for Financing and Investment Activity \nWhen determining whether to engage in transactions, we account for the degree to which the client has taken steps to avoid \nor mitigate risk and other due diligence as appropriate, based on the characteristics of the services we are providing. \nRegardless \nof Sector \nProhibited \n Projects with an adverse impact on wetlands designated as Wetlands of International Importance under \nthe Ramsar Convention \n Projects with an adverse impact on UNESCO World Heritage sites \n Projects violating the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora \n(Washington Convention) \n Projects which cause forced labor, child labor, or human trafficking \nAdditional \nDue \nDiligence \n Projects with adverse impacts on indigenous peoples’ local communities \n Projects involving land expropriation that causes forced relocation of residents \n Projects which cause violation of human rights in conflict areas \nForced Labor, Child \nLabor, Human \nTrafficking \n Companies exposed to risks of forced labor, child labor, or human trafficking. \n Policy: Aims to eliminate forced labor, child labor, and human trafficking from our business and value \nchain and strengthens our human rights due diligence. \nTransition Risk Sectors \n Target: Companies whose primary businesses are in power generation (coal-fired, oil-fired, gas-fired), \ncoal mining, oil and gas, steel, or cement. \n Policy: Proactively undertake engagement to support transition to a low-carbon society. \n Check at least once per year on the status of transition risk response. \nWe carefully consider whether or not to continue our business with a client in the event that the \nclient is not willing to address transition risk and has not formulated a transition strategy even \none year after the initial engagement. \nSpecific Industrial \nSectors \nWeapons Coal-fired power \ngeneration Thermal coal mining Oil and gas \nLarge-scale \nhydropower Large-scale agriculture Palm oil Lumber and pulp \n \n  \n                                         \n19 Financing and capital raising support provided by Mizuho.
