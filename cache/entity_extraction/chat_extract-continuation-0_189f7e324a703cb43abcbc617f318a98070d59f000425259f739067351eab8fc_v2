He was appointed as a \nNED from 1 April 2022. \nA third NED with a financial services background was \nsought to replace Clare Thompson, who retired from \nthe Board on 30 April 2022. Korn Ferry drew up an all-\nfemale long list of candidates of which four candidates \nwere interviewed by the Chairman and the Chief \nSustainability and People Officer. Two of the candidates \nwere then interviewed by the Group CEO and \nCommittee members. The Committee recommended \nto the Board that Sally Clark be appointed as a NED \ndue to her strong background in internal audit in \nfinancial services companies, as well as her interest and \nexperience in developing talent, and in diversity, culture \nand wellbeing. She joined the Board on 1 July 2022. \nCaroline Silver will have served on the Board for six \nyears by 31 October 2023. Our current practice is to \nnot renew NEDs for a third term unless there are \nexceptional circumstances or there has been a delay in \nthe recruitment process for a successor. Therefore, in \nlate 2022, the Committee discussed the potential skills \nthey would seek in a successor for Caroline on the \nBoard and as Chair of the Risk Committee and reviewed \na refreshed Board skills matrix. The Committee agreed \nto appoint Russell Reynolds to conduct a search and \nagreed an outline candidate specification. This process \nis ongoing. \nBoth Korn Ferry and Russell Reynolds are signatories to \nthe Enhanced Voluntary Code of Conduct for Executive \nSearch Firms. Both firms have provided other services \nto Bupa, including executive and non-executive search \nand benchmarking of roles and remuneration. Russell \nReynolds has an employee health insurance scheme \nprovided by Bupa. \nOther NED changes \nCath Keersâ€™ first three-year term as an NED concluded \non 31 October 2022. On the recommendation of the \nCommittee, the Board appointed Cath for a second \nthree-year term as they had assessed that she had been \nan effective member of the Board and Chair of the \nRemuneration Committee. Consideration was given \nto her capacity to devote sufficient time to her Bupa \nrole given her executive role with Sage Group plc \nand the good engagement she had with Bupaâ€™s \nReward team outside of the meetings of the \nRemuneration Committee. \nBupa Annual Report 2022 76 \n      \nÂ          \n      \n          \n         \n          \n         \n         \n    \n    \nÂ    \n       \n         \n       \n       \n      \n     \n        \n         \n          \n         \n       \n          \n       \n \n        \n     \n      \n          \n         \n         \n \n       \n        \n         \n         \n           \n           \n          \n        \n           \n        \n         \n         \n       \n  \n  \n      \n         \n        \n         \n         \n  \n \n       \n      \n        \n         \n      \nÂ           \nÂ        \n       \n        \n        \n        \n         \n       \n       \n        \n           \n       \nÂ          \n         \n        \n        \n         \n         \n        \nÂ        \n         \nÂ        \n      \nÂ        \nÂ   \n       \n     \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n         \n         \n         \n       \n       \n        \n     \n         \n â€ƒ â€ƒ â€ƒ â€ƒ  \n     \n   \nStrategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements \nNomination & Governance Committee report continued \nThe Committee reviewed the composition of \neach Committee of the Board during the year and \nrecommended changes to the committee composition, \nwhich came into effect in June 2022. This was done \npartly in order to appoint the recently recruited NEDs \nto the Committees that would best utilise their skill sets \nand also to provide greater flexibility by increasing the \nnumber of members of some of the Committees. The \nBoard approved the proposed changes. \nBoard independence, development and \nskills, knowledge and experience \nThe Committee regularly reviews the composition of \nthe Board to ensure that there remains an appropriate \ncombination of skills, experience and knowledge and \nsufficient diversity (including gender, social and ethnic \nbackgrounds), cognitive and personal strengths, and \nBoard succession planning encompasses these factors. \nAs mentioned above, the Board skills matrix was \nrefreshed during the year to update the assessment for \nthe existing Directors and include the skills of the new \nNEDs. This helped inform the role specification for the \nongoing recruitment of Caroline Silverâ€™s successor. The \nskills matrix also informs the plan for Board training and \ndevelopment sessions which is regularly considered by \nthe Committee. \nIn February each year the Committee reviews the \nDirectorsâ€™ other commitments (including external \nappointments) for potential conflicts of interest, \nimpacts on their capacity to perform their role for Bupa \nand for threats to their independence as Bupa NEDs. \nEach of the NEDs are considered to be independent. \nAssociation Members \nThe Committee received several updates and provided \nguidance on engagement with and recruitment of AMs \nduring the year and a schedule of planned engagement \nactivities is agreed by the Committee each year. Details \nof how we have engaged with AMs during the year are \nset out in the Section 172 statement on page 36. From \n2023, quarterly updates will be provided to AMs on the \nprogress of Bupaâ€™s performance against a number of \nKPIs related to pillars of the 3x6 strategy. A series of \none-to-one or small group informal meetings is also \nplanned for AMs with the Chairman, Group CEO and \nothers throughout the year in addition to the regular \nresults calls, AGM and autumn briefing sessions. \nCorporate governance oversight \nCode compliance oversight \nThe Committee has reviewed the Companyâ€™s \ncompliance with the Code during 2022 and found that \nthe Company has complied with the principles and \nprovisions of the Code throughout the year, to the \nextent that these are applicable to a company without \nshares or shareholders.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BUPA<|><|>organization<|>Bupa is a healthcare company that provides health insurance, medical services, and related healthcare products.
