BBVA AM \nnow markets 9 new investment funds (8 in \nSpain, 1 in Mexico), bringing the total number \nof investment vehicles using sustainability \ntargets and metrics to 33. Assets under \nmanagement in sustainable solutions at \nthe end of 2022 amounted to €7 ,020m \n(€5,598m in 2021), and net acquisition of \nnew funds was €976m (€1,559m in 2021).\nIn the retail banking segment, it is worth \nnoting that €3,133m correspond to funds \nthat promote ESG characteristics, that 108 \nmillion euros correspond to funds with a \nsustainable investment objective and that \n2,593 million euros correspond to pension \nplans that promote ESG characteristics.\nThe assets managed under the criteria \ndescribed above at year-end 2022 and 2021 \nare shown below:\nTABLE 10.

The Aqua card has \nbeen launched in Spain in its credit, debit \nand prepaid modalities, manufactured \n100% with recycled PVC (polyvinyl chloride) \nplastic, thus reducing the amount of new \nnatural resources that have to be used for \nits manufacture. In addition, the Aqua card \noffers the possibility of not issuing a physical \ncard at all.\nIn this line, BBVA in the main geographies in \nwhich it is present, also offers sustainable \ncards with 85.5% recycled PVC plastic for \ncustomers who renew a Visa International \nand Visa Gold credit card, with the idea of \ngradually extending this concept to all BBVA \ncredit and debit cards. \nP.  94\nBBVA Report on TCFD 2022\nThis English version is a translation of the original in Spanish for information purposes only.
