Refer to \npage 41 for further details on ESE policies for the power generation and oil and gas sectors \n • Specialist team to focus on energy transition: During 2022, we set up a specialist team to focus on energy \ntransition, given the role energy is expected to play in the decarbonisation of other systems. This new team \nwill work on identifying opportunities to support transition, including large scale energy infrastructure, and also \nsupporting growth businesses that will be important to transition over the next decade. Some examples include \nnew technologies like hydrogen supply, storage and distribution, carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) as \nwell as supporting the wider alternative waste treatment technologies sector and clean transport infrastructure. \nThe initial focus of the team has been to understand existing challenges and potential opportunities, coordinating \ninternally to bring One Bank thinking to support financing the energy transition. Regional virtual teams have been \ncreated to focus on identifying specific opportunities to support customers looking to grow in this crucial sector.\nElectricity generation\n • Financing renewable energy projects: NatWest Group has been a leading lender to the UK power and \nrenewables sector over the last 10 years. Renewable energy has lower emissions than energy produced from \noil and gas. During 2022, we provided £1.3 billion of climate and sustainable funding and financing to solar and \nwind projects.\n • Lending criteria: NatWest Group ESE policy suite includes policies related to power generation and mining and \nmetals. Refer to page 41 for further details.\n39NatWest Group plc | 2022 Climate-related Disclosures Report\nGovernance Strategy and Climate transition plan Risk Management and Scenario Analysis Metrics and TargetsIntroduction\nClimate transition plan: Energy system continued\nThe current energy crisis provides a clear incentive to shift away from fossil fuels to avoid exposure to geopolitical price shocks. \nExternal dependencies to support transition:\nThe UK CCC 2022 Progress Report states that electricity generation needs to be fully decarbonised by 2035 to \nachieve its balanced net zero pathway and has rated policies intended to achieve the UK’s 2035 target for this \nsector as being “credible”. In comparison, the UK CCC 2022 Progress Report has provided an overall rating for \npolicies aimed at reducing emissions from fuel supply as having “some risk”. In addition, The UK CCC 2022 \nProgress Report also states that:\n • The government and the oil and gas industry can increase its current ambition of a 50% reduction in emissions \nfor the sector by 2030 against 2018 levels to 68%.\n • Policy support to increase production from North Sea oil and gas through the Energy Security Strategy (ESE) \nand the Energy Profits Levy would provide an insufficient policy signal to achieve the UK Government’s 50% \ndecarbonisation target for the sector.\nGovernment policies:\n • The North Sea Transition Deal, published in March 2021, commits to reducing the greenhouse gas footprint \nof North Sea oil and gas production and processing by 50% by 2030, relative to 2018 levels.\n • In parallel, the UK Emissions Trading System (ETS) limits total emissions from facilities that are large emitters, \nincluding from oil and gas extraction facilities and refineries. In 2022, carbon prices under the UK ETS have \nreached an average price of £80 per tonne, around 45% higher than the £55 per tonne average price between \nMay to December 2021.\n • Policies to reduce methane emissions, expected to support 23% abatement for the UK’s 2035 targets, are \nassessed as “credible” by the UK CCC 2022 Progress Report. The UK Government has approved the Iron \nMains Risk Reduction Programme, with an aim of reducing the risk of methane emissions in gas pipes, while the \n2021 Methane Action Plan and flaring reduction plans are based on voluntary commitments.\n • Electrification of oil and gas platforms: the UK CCC 2022 Progress Report says policies that could deliver \n22% of the 2035 abatement for the UK Net Zero Strategy are rated as being at “significant risk”. There is no \nclear mechanism to provide incentives to overcome barriers involved with electrification of oil and gas platforms.\n • CCUS in refineries: the UK CCC reports “some risk” to policies that are being developed, but are yet to be \nput in place, to achieve the 15% 2035 abatement from these facilities.\n • Bio-energy best-use CCS readiness: there is “some risk” to the 7% 2035 abatement that could be achieved \nin the Biomass Strategy, which would support growth in domestic biomass supply alongside the rapid \ndeployment of Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) in power generation and biofuels plants.\n • Renewables: the UK CCC 2022 Progress Report rates policies to support renewable deployment as “credible” \nto deliver the 80% 2035 abatement within the electricity generation sector. This is particularly due to the \nincreased Energy Security Strategy (ESS) to deploy up to 50 GW of offshore wind by 2030 and 70 GW of solar \nby 2035. This can be achieved through annual auctions for low-carbon electricity contracts, including onshore \nwind and solar. The ESS also commits to reduce consenting time for offshore wind projects. \n • Flexible low-carbon generation and storage: which is expected to contribute 10% of 2035 abatement for the\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
