We also considered \nthe physical risk of climate change – including the effect of extreme weather events at sample strategic sites, based on internal and external analysis. \nSignificant CGUs \nGoodwill arising on the acquisition of businesses is allocated, at acquisition, to the CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
