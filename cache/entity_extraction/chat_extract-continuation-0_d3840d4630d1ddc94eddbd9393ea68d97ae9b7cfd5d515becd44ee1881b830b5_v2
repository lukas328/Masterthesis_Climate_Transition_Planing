value\nBusiness model\nWe help decarbonise global energy demand,  \nbuild energy independence, and enable  \nprosperous and resilient societies through our \nthree core business areas: Development,  \nPower Solutions, and Service�\nThrough development activities, we help expand the pipeline of \npermitted renewable energy projects � \nOur primary business activity by revenue is the sale of Power \nSolutions, primarily onshore and offshore wind turbines � We are the \noldest and largest supplier of wind energy technology globally and \nare actively engaged in expanding our Power Solutions capabilities \nto enable an ecosystem of sustainable energy technologies �\nFinally, through routine inspection, maintenance, component repair \nand refurbishment, and service upgrades, we help our

\ncompromising the ability of future ge-nerations to \nmeet theirs (Brundtland Commis-sion 1987)� If a \npractice can continue over time and causes little \nor no harm to people or the planet, it is considered \nsocially and environmentally sustainable� \nSustainability at Vestas means reducing or eliminating negative \nenvironmental and social impacts � It also means maximising the \nvalue that our business and products create for our customers, \nemployees, shareholders, suppliers, local communities, and the \nplanet at large � It involves upholding sustainability in governance \nstructures, whereby we hold ourselves accountable to international -\nly recognised principles and standards, act with integrity and \nresponsibility, and safeguard responsible processes and remunera -\ntions� We believe these efforts not only enhance our own perfor -\nmance but help elevate the standards of our industry as a whole �\nAt Vestas, sustainability is grounded  \nin our four corporate values:\n \nSimplicity\nWe eliminate the use of unnecessary resources \nand optimise our energy solutions for displacing \ncarbon emissions �\n \nCollaboration\nWe seek a partnership approach to creating \nsustainable solutions, as we acknowledge that \ngreat achievements are only realised through  \njoint action � \nAccountability\nWe commit to behaving responsibly and
