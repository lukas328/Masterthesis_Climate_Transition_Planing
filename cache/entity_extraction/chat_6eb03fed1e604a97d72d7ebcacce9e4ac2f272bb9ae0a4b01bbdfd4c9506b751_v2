In line with \nthis commitment, we have set interim targets that were developed in accordance with our net zero \nmethodology, outlined below. \n \nStrategy\n \nPART 3\nStep 1:  \nIdentifying Scope and \nMetrics \nTo start, we determine what emissions are relevant and appropriate to include for \neach sector and what parts, if any, of the sector portfolio should be excluded from \nthe process. \nStep 2:  \nEstablishing the Baseline  \nNext, we calculate financed emissions and emissions intensity metrics for each \nsector , and determine the appropriate type of baseline and target for  \nthat sector . Here, we determine what data sources to use and determine our data \nquality score. \nStep 3:  \nIdentifying Decarbonization \nPathways and Setting \nTargets  \nTo understand the possible pathways from our baseline to our ultimate net zero \ntarget, we benchmark against available scenarios for each sector and decide on \nthe appropriate one. Next, we identify the difference between our current portfolio \nemissions and where they need to be by 2030, under the selected decarbonization \npathway. We then establish our interim 2030 targets.\nStep 4:  \nDeveloping Strategies for \nAchieving the Targeted \nEmissions Reductions   \nThis next step involves the development of an implementation plan to achieve \ntargeted reductions in each of the sectors. For corporate clients material to our net \nzero boundary, this entails a review of their decarbonization goals and plans together \nwith more broadly engaging with them on their strategy and identifying transition \nbusiness opportunities with respect to (for example) transition finance or advisory.\nStep 5:  \nReporting and Verification \nWe report our emissions and information on our transition plan in our annual TCFD \ndisclosure. This includes financed emissions attributed from our clients’ Scope 1, \nScope 2 and relevant Scope 3 emissions. This stage also includes continual work on  \nimprovements to our financed emissions data, such as using client engagement to \nincrease and enhance publicly reported information.\n18 | TCFD REPORT 2022: CITI’S APPROACH TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND NET ZERO\nNet Zero Plan for New Sectors\nBefore detailing our Net Zero Plan for Auto Manufacturing, Commercial Real Estate, Steel and Thermal Coal \nMining, this section briefly describes how we calculate our emissions baselines and key metrics utilizing \nthe Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) methodology and analyze various climate \nscenarios (including those published by the International Energy Agency (IEA) to understand the potential \ndecarbonization pathways and establish emissions reduction targets. \nEstablishing our Net Zero Methodology \nPCAF is an open collaboration of financial institutions working to develop a global carbon accounting \nstandard for how financial institutions measure and disclose Scope 3 “financed emissions,” or the underlying \nGHG emissions generated by the entities in which a financial institution invests or to which it lends money. \nCiti joined PCAF in 2020 and has drawn upon its methodology in calculating our financed emissions. For \nmore information on PCAF, see page 45 of our 2020 TCFD Report. \nIn last year’s report, we explained how we calculate absolute financed emissions metrics in two ways: (1) \nusing committed funds (the capital available to a client for a certain use) and (2) using outstanding funds \n(the funds actually drawn down on such available credit), per the PCAF standard. For the purposes of \nunderstanding our absolute financed emissions, forward-looking emissions management and establishing \nabsolute targets where relevant (for certain sectors), we rely on the first of these approaches — total \ncommitted exposure. This more accurately reflects the maximum amount that Citi has agreed to finance \nfor these clients, although we provide both metrics for transparency. We have used the committed funds \napproach for all four new sectors.  \nCiti’s Net Zero Transition Principles — Summary \nIn 2021, we drafted our Net Zero Transition Principles to guide us in our implementation of our net \nzero commitment and targets.\nNet Zero Leadership – Set ambitious and transparent net zero targets aligned with climate science.\nFocus on Transition – Partner with clients through their transition and assist clients’ and \ngovernments’ evaluation of carbon-intensive assets and subsequent retirement or divestment. \nSocial Responsibility – Strive to ensure Citi’s transition to net zero is consistent with sustainable \ndevelopment objectives and assess the impact of our financing decisions upon lower-income \ncommunities and developing countries.\nClient Transparency – Partner with clients to aid development of their decarbonization strategies, \ncommunicating clearly and transparently.\nConstructive Engagement – Promote climate-related policies and regulations.\nDisclosure – Annually report on Citi’s progress and transition.\nTCFD REPORT 2022: CITI’S APPROACH TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND NET ZERO | 19\nCurrently, there is no single, global, cross-sector data provider that adequately and consistently covers our \nneeded scope for data to analyze emissions and assess physical and transition risks across our operations \nand portfolios. Instead, we obtain historic reported data and leverage certain third-party vendors, such as \nCDP (formerly, the Carbon Disclosure Project) and S&P Global Trucost, to supplement existing data to meet \nspecific needs. We also use the PCAF emissions factor database when needed to fill data gaps. \nPCAF has established a data quality hierarchy that allows Citi to score emissions estimates for all clients. \nData scores range from 1 to 5, with a score of 1 signifying disclosed and third party verified emissions — \nthe highest quality data — and a score of 5 signifying the\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
