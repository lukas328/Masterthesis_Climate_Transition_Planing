This affects the return \non variable-rate assets, the cost of variable-rate liabilities and the Statement of Financial Position value of \nits investment in fixed rate bonds. Variable-rate assets represent a natural hedge for variable-rate liabilities. \nThe net asset balance on which the Group is exposed as at 31 December 2022 was £2,154m (2021: £2,002m). \nThe rate at which maturing deposits are reinvested, in currencies such as sterling and Australian dollar where \nthe Group has a significant variable-rate net asset exposure, represents a significant potential risk to the Group. \nThe Group has also used interest rate swaps to manage interest rate exposure whereby the requirement to settle \ninterest at fixed rates has been swapped for variable rates. This increases the ability to match variable-rate assets \nwith variable-rate liabilities. \nVariable loans are repriced at intervals of between one and six months. Interest is settled on all loans in line with \nagreements and is settled at least annually. \nThe impact of a hypothetical rise of 100 basis points (bps) in interest rates at the reporting date, on an annualised \nbasis, would have decreased equity by £3m and profit by £2m (2021: decrease of £7m and £6m respectively). The \nimpact of a fall of 100 bps in interest rates, on an annualised basis, would have the inverse effect. This calculation \nis based on the assumption that all other variables, in particular foreign exchange rates, remain constant. \nBupa Annual Report 2022 189 \n   \n                    \n \n                    \n                   \n                   \n                        \n                    \n          \n    \n                    \n                  \n \n             \n                 \n              \n                  \n                 \n   \n               \n                   \n                    \n               \n                     \n                \n               \n \n                      \n                    \n                   \n                \n               \n       \n               \n     \n \n      \n      \n    \n            \n             \n                \n     \n              \n          \n      \n   \nStrategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements \nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \ncontinued \nInterest rate hedging activities \nThe Group applies fair value hedges and cash flow hedges to hedge its exposure to interest rate risk on its \nborrowings. \nAs at 31 December 2022, interest rate swaps totalling £600m have been entered into, to swap the fixed rate \ncoupon on two £300m senior unsecured bonds to a variable rate. These interest rate swaps are designated as fair \nvalue hedges of the underlying interest rate risk on the debt. The fair value movement in the bonds attributable \nto the hedged risk for the year ended 31 December 2022 amounted to a gain of £43m (2021: £28m). The fair value \nmovement on the interest rate swaps amounted to a loss of £45m (2021: £28m) and the fair value and carrying \nvalue of this derivative is a £61m liability (2021: £16m liability). \n26.3 Credit risk \nCredit risk is the risk that those that are in debt to the Group default on their obligations. Examples of credit \nrisk would be non-payment of a trade receivable or a corporate bond failing to repay the capital sum and \nrelated interest. \nInvestment exposure with external counterparties is managed by the Enterprise Treasury Policy which ensures \nthat there is a sufficient spread of investments and that cash and investment counterparties are rated at least \nA/A2 unless otherwise approved. The Corporate Finance Executive Committee approves the full list of \ncounterparties used on a periodic basis. There are exceptions to the A/A2 rating requirement for a number of \nreasons including where local country ratings are below this level and due to certain regulatory and commercial \nrequirements in specific markets. \nIn estimating Expected Credit Losses (ECL) on financial investments, the Group reviews individual issuer's default \nprobability based on a credit score model over a 12-month horizon to determine whether there has been a material \nchange in an issue score from the preceding period. Where a specific default score is not available for a single \ninvestment, average default probabilities for instruments with a similar credit rating are used. Determining when \nan issuer is in financial difficulty and that a lifetime ECL allowance is required, requires the use of judgement. The \nGroup considers a number of factors including economy wide and industry specific risk factors, issuer’s financial \nand liquidity position, near-term prospects, credit rating\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
