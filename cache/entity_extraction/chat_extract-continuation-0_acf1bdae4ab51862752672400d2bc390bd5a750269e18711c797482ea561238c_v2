Customer contracts are amortised when the relevant income stream occurs. All \nother intangible assets are amortised by using the straight-line method over the useful lives \nfrom the time they are first available for use. Amortisation is recognised within administrative \nexpenses. The estimated useful lives vary according to the specific asset, but are typically: \n• customer contracts and relationships – 1 to 15 years; \n• capitalised computer software – 3 to 10 years; \n• patents, trademarks and licences – 3 to 20 years; \n• acquired research and technology – 4 to 10 years; and \n• capitalised development currently being amortised – 3 to 8 years. \nIntangible assets which are not yet being amortised are subject to annual impairment reviews. \n  \nNotes on the Accounts continued for the year ended 31st March 2023 \n153 \n1 Accounting policies continued \nInvestments in joint ventures and associates \nA joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby investees are able to exercise joint control of \nthe arrangement. \nAssociates are entities over which the group exercises significant influence when it has the \npower to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the entity but it does not \nhave the power to control or jointly control the entity. \nInvestments in joint ventures and associates are accounted for using the equity method of \naccounting and are initially recognised at cost. Thereafter the investments are adjusted to \nrecognise the group’s share of the post-acquisition profits or losses after tax of the investee in \nthe income statement, and the group’s share of movements in other comprehensive income \nof the investee in other comprehensive income. Dividends received or receivable from \nassociates are recognised as a reduction in the carrying amount of the investment. The \ncarrying value of the investments are reviewed for impairment triggers on a regular basis.  \nWhere the group’s share of losses in an equity-accounted investment equals or exceeds its \ninterest in the entity, the group does not recognise further losses unless it has incurred \nobligations to do so.  \nUnrealised gains and losses on transactions between the group and its associates are \neliminated to the extent of the group’s interest in these joint ventures and associates. \nLeases  \nLeases are recognised as a right-of-use asset, together with a corresponding lease liability, at \nthe date at which the leased asset is available for use.  \nThe right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial value of the \nlease liability, lease payments made (net of any incentives received from the lessor) before the \ncommencement of the lease, initial direct costs and restoration costs. The right-of-use asset is \ndepreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term \nin operating profit.  \nThe lease liability is initially measured as the present value of future lease payments \ndiscounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, where this rate is not determinable, \nthe group’s incremental borrowing rate, which is the interest rate the group would have to pay \nto borrow the amount necessary to obtain an asset of similar value in a similar economic \nenvironment with similar terms and conditions. Interest is charged to finance costs at a \nconstant rate of interest on the outstanding lease liability over the lease term.  \nPayments in respect of short-term leases, low-value leases and precious metal leases \nare charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term in \noperating profit. \nThe group leases precious metals to fund temporary peaks in metal requirements provided \nmarket conditions allow. These leases are from banks for specified periods (less than 12 \nmonths) and the group pays a fee which is expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease \nterm in finance costs. The group holds sufficient precious metal inventories to meet all the \nobligations under these lease arrangements as they fall due. \nInventories \nPrecious metal \nInventories of gold, silver and platinum group metals are valued according to the source from \nwhich the metal is obtained. Metal which has been purchased and committed to future sales \nto customers is valued at the price at which it is contractually committed, adjusted for \nunexpired contango and backwardation. Other precious metal inventories owned by the \ngroup, which are unhedged, are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value using the \nweighted average cost formula. \nOther \nNon-precious metal inventories are valued at the lower of cost, including attributable \noverheads, and net realisable value. Except where costs are specifically identified, the first-in, \nfirst-out cost formula is used to value inventories. \nCash and cash equivalents \nCash and deposits comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with a maturity \ndate of three months or less from the date of acquisition. Money market funds comprise \ninvestments in funds that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in fair value. The \ngroup and parent company routinely use short-term bank overdraft facilities, which are \nrepayable on demand, as an integral part of their cash management policies and, therefore, \ncash and cash equivalents include cash and deposits, money market funds and bank \noverdrafts. Offset arrangements across group businesses have been applied to arrive at the net \ncash and overdraft figures. \nAt 31st March 2023 cash and cash equivalents includes £15 million (31st March 2022: £111 \nmillion) of restricted amounts relating to cash held in Russia. The prior year balance relates to \nrestricted amounts in South Africa.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>2004<|>EVENT<|>The year 2004 is referenced as the date at which the carrying amount of assets is considered, including subsequent impairments)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAR 2023<|>EVENT<|>The fiscal year ending on 31st March 2023 is mentioned as the period for the notes on the accounts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CUSTOMER CONTRACTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Customer contracts are intangible assets amortised over their relevant income streams, typically 1 to 15 years)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAPITALISED COMPUTER SOFTWARE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Capitalised computer software is an intangible asset amortised over 3 to 10 years)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PATENTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Patents, trademarks, and licences are intangible assets amortised over 3 to 20 years)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Acquired research and technology are intangible assets amortised over 4 to 10 years)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEVELOPMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Capitalised development currently being amortised over 3 to 8 years)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOINT VENTURES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Joint ventures are arrangements where investees exercise joint control, recognized using the equity method)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASSOCIATES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Associates are entities over which the group has significant influence but not control, recognized using the equity method)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INVESTMENTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Investments in joint ventures and associates are initially recognized at cost and adjusted for post-acquisition profits, losses, and impairments)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEASES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Leases are recognized as right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, depreciated over the shorter of useful life and lease term)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RIGHT-OF-USE ASSET<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, including lease payments, direct costs, and restoration costs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEASE LIABILITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Lease liability is measured as the present value of future lease payments, discounted using the implicit or incremental borrowing rate)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRECIOUS METAL INVENTORIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Inventories of gold, silver, and platinum group metals valued based on source, contract price, or lower of cost and net realisable value)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NON-PRECIOUS METAL INVENTORIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value, using FIFO where costs are not specifically identified)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Includes cash, short-term deposits, money market funds, and bank overdrafts, with restrictions noted for amounts in Russia and South Africa)\n##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
