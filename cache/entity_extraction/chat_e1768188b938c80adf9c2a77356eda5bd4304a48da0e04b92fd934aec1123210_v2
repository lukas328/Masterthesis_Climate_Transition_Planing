However, these metrics remain well under 2019 levels while other key metrics have continued to trend downwards. \nLocation-based GHG emissions (tCO2e) Energy consumption (GWh)\nWater consumption (m3)\nMarket-based GHG emissions (tCO2e)\nWaste generated (t) Paper used (t)\nNatWest Group’s own operational footprint continued\n(1) Location-based GHG emissions method reflects the average emissions intensity of grids on which energy consumption occurs (using grid-average emission factors). Market-based emissions reflect emissions from electricity procured from sources NatWest Group has selected, including \nrenewable electricity. As renewable sources have nearly zero emissions associated with energy generation, market-based emissions are lower than location-based emissions. Refer to Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting and Emissions Methodology section on the following page \nfor further details of the basis of GHG emissions calculation.\n(2) Units of measure: tCO2e is metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent; GWh is Gigawatt hours of energy, MWh is Megawatt hours of energy; t is a metric tonne; m3 is a cubic metre; FTE is a full-time employee equivalent.\n(3) Waste generated comprises: Recycled (2022 6,674t, 2021 8,486t, 2020 7,217t, 2019 9,405t), Incineration (2022 1,091t, 2021 1,170t, 2020 2,\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
