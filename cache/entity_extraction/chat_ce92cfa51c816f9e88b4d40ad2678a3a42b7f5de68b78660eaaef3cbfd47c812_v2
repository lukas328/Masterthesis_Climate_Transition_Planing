first phase we seek to establish an understanding of  \nthe country context in which a wind farm project is planned through \na 'social-lens'� This is followed by an in-depth assessment of social \nissues on project-level carried out in accordance with the IFC \nPerformance Standards on Environmental and Social Sustainability \n(IFC PS)� \nThe assessment determines to what extent information about \nstakeholder engagement, land acquisition, local employment, cul  -\ntural customs and heritage, community health and safety, or access \nto a grievance mechanism and remedy for impacted communities \nhave been adequately addressed � The in-depth assessment also \naims to determine whether there is any known past or present com  - \nmunity opposition to the project or other infrastructure projects in \nthe same area �\nAs part of this assessment, we consider whether a site visit is \nrelevant to verify or collect project data � The latter is relevant where \nproject data is limited for completing our social due diligence � \nWe use our leverage and influence in customer dialogues to address \nour SDD findings � This ensures that we clarify any uncertainties \nlinked to identified potential social risks and the division of social \nroles and responsibilities in time, prior to closure of contractual \nemployer requirements � Such issues may include stakeholder \nengagement, land acquisition, local employment, cultural customs \nand heritage, community health and safety, or access to remedy for \nimpacted communities and workers � \nThe developer of the wind farm will, during a public consultation, \npresent potential risks and how the project intends to prevent or, \nwhere prevention is not possible, mitigate the impact � During these \nmeetings the developer gains more insight into how the public \nperceives the project � In addition, the public is given an opportunity \nto raise any concerns or expectations towards the project � \nOur SDD tool facilitates the \nreview of our customer’s \nEnvironmental & Social Impact \nAssessment (ESIA) & Stakehold-\ner Engagement Plan\nIt also establishes social \nroles & responsibilities \nacross project stakeholders\nEstablish relationship with \nand maximise affected com-\nmunities' opportunities\nEstablish operational grievance \nmechanism between Vestas and \nthe community\nIdentify

2022\nSocialIn brief General GovernanceEnvironment Sustainability data Appendix\n60\nAffected communities\nIn the case of complex projects, or those where project documenta -\ntion does not meet our SDD standards, we may use external \nconsultants and experts to inform our SDD � The SDD is an active \ndocument and can be reviewed if there are significant changes to \nthe project development, construction, or service phase �\nThe findings of the SDD inform the second phase where we prepare \nand implement project-level social management plans, tailored to \nthe risks, while also seeking to maximise local community opportu -\nnities� We may decide to allocate an on-site social coordinator to \nimplement social mitigation measures, which may include job \ncreation and procurement of local sourcing specifically during the \nconstruction phase, educating affected communities about wind \nenergy to dispel any myths, establishing a channel for affected \ncommunities to raise a concern or grievance, and/or community \ndevelopment initiatives aiming at improving the quality of life in the \naffected community � \nThe frequency of our engagements with affected communities or \ntheir representatives varies from project to project � To see some of \nour latest community initiatives in 2022, see page 64 � \nProgress on our social management plan is reported to the customer \non a monthly basis as part of the Health, Safety, Social and \nEnvironmental statistic � Therefore, our SDD is conducted in an \nongoing basis �\nDevelopment\nWe are committed to engaging respectfully with the communities \nbased in the areas where we plan and operate projects, to be \nsensitive to environmental and cultural values, and to make a \npositive contribution to the regions in which we operate � In Australia, \nwe are a signatory of the Clean Energy Council’s Best Practice \nCharter for Renewable Energy Developments that sets out 10 \nstatements regarding how we engage with communities, manage \ncommunity impacts, and advance local opportunities � In Indonesia, \nwe have partnered with organisations that work through local \nschools and community-based projects to empower vulnerable \nyouth and adults �\nWe take an active role in engaging with stakeholders such as \nlandowners, agencies, and partners throughout the development \nprocess to ensure stakeholders get timely updates of project news \nand community members are informed of any actions that might \nrelate to their property, business, or day-to-day activities � Means of \nengagement with community members and leaders in the local area \ninclude hosting public consultations, open houses and webinars, \nvisiting local schools, and attending public events � \nGrievance mechanism and redress \nWe are committed to strengthening our understanding of the \nconcerns, doubts, and expectations of affected communities � \nConsequently, we have put in place an operational Grievance \nMechanism (GM) in which an individual or group can raise concerns, \ncomplaints, and doubts transparently and safely � In sharing \ngrievances as they arise, we can strengthen our relationship with \naffected communities and proactively engage with grievances �\nThe GM can take the form of various communication channels  \nwhich may vary depending on local customs and characteristics �  \nThe primary channel is face-to-face communication,\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1,
