As such, the results of measurement of financed emissions may change significantly in the future due \nto clients expanding their calculations of emissions. \n・ We applied the emission factor from the IEA World Energy Outlook to estimate emissions from project finance for power \ngeneration projects and the emission factors for the sector per unit of revenue from the PCAF database to estimate emissions \nfrom corporate finance. These emission factors may be further refined or otherwise modified going forward, which may also \nlead to significant changes in the results of measurement. \n・ Methods of measurement may also change in the future due to changes and improvements to the methodology of the PCAF \nStandard, clarification of practical standards  for measurement and target setting (definitions, scope of measurement, time \nframes, etc.), and similar factors. In the event of such changes, we will clearly state which points have changed when \ndisclosing our measurement results. \n \n(3) Actions going forward \nThis year we have disclosed measurement results for 19 sectors in corporate finance and project finance, but we still face many \nchallenges regarding measurement. The following are some examples of issues that should be addressed going forward. \n \na. Scope of measurement \nAsset class: Because of a lack of data and of an established methodology, our measurements excluded loans to special purpose \nvehicles for securitization, trade finance, and sovereign loans, even under corporate finance and project finance. Proprietary \ntrading and underwriting with individual companies was also outside the scope of measurement, as it constituted only a small \npercentage of the portfolio and did not have an established methodology. \n52Mt\n44Mt\n23Mt\n77Mt\n62Mt\n61Mt\n0\n25\n50\n75\n100\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n■ Financed emissions [Scope 1, 2 total] (left axis) \n■ Financed emissions [Scope 3] (left axis) \n■ Loan balance (right axis) \nEmissions  \n(MtCO2) \nLoan balance  \n(USD 1B) \n  \nTCFD Report 2022  -65- \n \n \nSectors: We selected sectors covering all of the recommended disclosures (carbon-related assets) under the TCFD \nRecommendations. However, in order to determine what percentage of Mizuho’s portfolio these sectors comprise, we needed to \nundertake measurement across all sectors. At the same time, as the challenges of obtaining emissions disclosure data from \nsectors outside the scope of this measurement necessitates the use of estimates, we are aware that from the perspective of \nensuring the usability of data we must give attention to accuracy as well. \n \nIn light of the above, we will look into the possibilities of further expanding the scope of measurement in phases by employing new \nmethodologies and collecting additional data, while also taking into account our priorities in our goals for measuring financed \nemissions, such as application in future target setting and monitoring for Scope 3 emissions. \n \nb. Improvement of data quality \nWe performed the measurement for corporate finance by combining our clients’ reported data (data quality score (“score”) 1 or 2) \nwith estimates based on company revenue (score 4) and for project finance for power generation projects by integrating estimates \nbased on power generation (score 3). There were more than a few discrepanci es between the company/project reported data \n(score 1 or 2) and estimated data (score 4 or 5). Accurately assessing the real situation will require using more precise data. \n \nWhile taking into account our priorities in line with our goals for measuring financed emissions, we will pursue greater \nimprovements in the quality of data by utilizing more external data, communicating with vendors, and undertaking engagement\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MIZUHO FINANCIAL GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Mizuho Financial Group is a major financial institution involved in corporate and project finance, providing disclosures on emissions and sustainability strategies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ELECTRIC UTILITIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sector including power generation and power transmission companies involved in electricity production and distribution)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OIL AND GAS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sector comprising companies involved in upstream production, midstream, and downstream oil and gas activities, including energy companies with significant emissions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STEEL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Steel industry companies engaged in steel manufacturing, contributing to industrial emissions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUTOMOBILES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Automobile manufacturing companies involved in vehicle production, with implications for emissions and sustainability)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAPITAL GOODS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Companies producing capital equipment and machinery used in various industries)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHEMICALS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Chemical manufacturing companies involved in producing chemicals for industrial and consumer use)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARITIME<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Maritime industry including shipping and port operations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRANSPORTATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Transport sector including various modes of transit and logistics companies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>METALS AND MINING<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Companies involved in extracting and processing metals and minerals)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FOODS AND MEATS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Food production and meat processing companies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CEMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cement manufacturing companies contributing to industrial emissions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PAPER AND FOREST<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Companies involved in paper production and forestry activities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONSTRUCTION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Construction firms engaged in building infrastructure and buildings)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MIZUHO FINANCIAL GROUP<|>PERSON<|>CEO message indicating leadership and strategic direction in sustainability and emissions measurement)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TCFD REPORT 2022<|>EVENT<|>A sustainability disclosure event providing data and insights on financed emissions and climate-related risks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SECTORS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Various industry sectors including energy, industrials, and consumer goods, analyzed for emissions measurement)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMPANIES AND PROJECTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Entities involved in financed emissions measurement, including power generation and corporate finance projects)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MIZUHO FINANCIAL GROUP<|>SECTORS<|>Mizuho's measurement efforts cover multiple sectors to assess financed emissions<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MIZUHO FINANCIAL GROUP<|>COMPANIES AND PROJECTS<|>Mizuho measures financed emissions for various companies and projects within sectors<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SECTORS<|>COMPANIES AND PROJECTS<|>Companies and projects are categorized within sectors for emissions measurement<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MIZUHO FINANCIAL GROUP<|>CEO message<|>The CEO message reflects leadership in sustainability and emissions reduction strategies<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TCFD REPORT 2022<|>MIZUHO FINANCIAL GROUP<|>The TCFD Report 2022 is published by Mizuho to disclose climate-related financial data<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
