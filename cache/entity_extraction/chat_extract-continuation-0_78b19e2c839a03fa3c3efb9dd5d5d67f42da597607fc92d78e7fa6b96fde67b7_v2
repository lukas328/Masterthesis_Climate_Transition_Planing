For example this year:\nâ€¢ At our UK refinery, improvements in process operations allowed flue dusts to be reworked \ninto furnaces which eliminated a waste stream. There were general reductions in waste \nfrom improving production processes so that less off-specification material was produced. \nâ€¢ At our Smithfield site in the US we upgraded our NOx abatement system. This reduced \nourÂ emissions and hazardous waste on site and helped us towards our 2030 target.\nâ€¢ Working with our third-party waste provider in the UK, we also increased the proportion \nofÂ waste streams being recycled by 5%.\nWe continue to recycle the majority of our production waste containing PGMs in our \nownÂ refineries.       \nOur most significant progress towards our 2030 target on hazardous waste reduction  \ncomes this year with the ongoing investment in our new Third Century PGM refinery \ninÂ Royston. This is due to be operational later in the decade.\n \n        \nUsing water responsibly\nClimate change and population growth are bringing ever greater stress to availability \nofÂ freshwater supplies globally. 2022 saw us launch our first global water policy to help \nsitesÂ adopt effective water management plans, improve measurement and reduce water \nconsumption, driving us towards our 2030 water target.\nTo understand where we need to act most quickly for most benefit, we used the World \nResource Instituteâ€™s (WRI) Water Risk Atlas tool to analyse usage at our sites. The tool \nidentified 12 manufacturing facilities, which are located in regions with a high or extremely \nhigh baseline water stress level. This means that they are at higher risk of declining water \navailability or increased cost in the future due to drought or groundwater table decline. \nTheÂ 12 manufacturing facilities accounted for 399,174m3 (23%) of our net fresh water \nconsumption in 2022/23.Â \nWe discharged 1.36 million m3 wastewater during the year, 96% to municipal treatment \nplants and the remainder back to its original freshwater source after treatment. We treated \n1.05 million m3 of waste water on-site, of which we recycled 23% back into our \nmanufacturing processes instead of discharging.\nWe seek to minimise the chemical burden in our wastewater discharged. 1.36 million m3  \nwas discharged from our sites with an average chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 242 mg/L.\nReducing emissions to air \nSome of our operations produce other air emissions as by-products of chemical reactions, \nincluding nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulphur oxides (SOx) and volatile organic compounds \n(VOCs). All our permitted sites monitor these emissions to ensure they comply with \nlocalÂ regulations.\nThis year we saw a decrease in our year-on-year NOx emissions, despite increasing our \ncoverage of reporting. We fitted an enhanced NOx abatement at our Smithfield site, US to \nhelp reduce them even further in future. We also continued to improve our methodologies \naround measuring and reporting the emissions we produce globally in a standardised way. \nWe have reviewed the new UK BAT waste gas for chemicals (UKWGC) and are making \npreparations to ensure we will be in compliance with the stricter emissions to air limits ahead \nof the significant change in emissions legislation in the UK in 2027.\nWe donâ€™t produce ozone-depleting substances (ODS) through our operations, however, \nanyÂ small leaks of refrigerant gases are reported in our Scope 1 GHG emissions.\nPlanet: Protecting nature and
