Today, our \nproducts are installed in around one-third of \nall new cars on the road, as well as a significant \nnumber of trucks and buses around the world. They \nactively deliver cleaner air to billions of people globally. \nClimate change and a growing body of air quality \nregulations are pushing the automotive \nindustry to build cleaner engines and deliver \nnew powertrain options. With our decades \nof experience in the industry and long \nhistory of innovation, we aim to be \nthe lasting partner for our customers, \nplaying a significant role in the \ntransformation of mobility. \nPositioning ourselves to win big\nOur leading role in auto-catalysts is underpinned by deep expertise in complex PGM \nchemistry and catalysis, distinctive technology, longstanding relationships and a global \nstate-of-the-art production footprint. As the auto industry goes through unprecedented \nchange, transitioning towards zero-emission vehicles, clean and efficient internal combustion \nengine vehicles have a big role to play for decades to come. We aim to be the lasting partner \nthat our customers can rely on at each step of their journey towards sustainable mobility. \nCustomer facing and market-focused\nThe global regulatory landscape will continue to be favourable to our business. Our best-\nin-class technology is ready to help our customers meet more challenging regulations that \nimprove air quality and ultimately save lives. Our use of modelling is increasing the speed \nand accuracy of our product and system designs – helping to create more value for existing \ncustomers and win new ones.\nOur catalysts enable our customers’ flexibility in fuel choice – from traditional diesel \nor gasoline, to hydrogen, to e-fuels. Our catalysts also reduce emissions from marine and \nstationary sources, for example, in data centres. These are markets that will continue to grow \nover the next decade.  \n92k\nadditional tonnes of \nNOx removed from \ntailpipes in 2022/23\nWe play a leading role in heavy \nduty diesel technology \nAround 1 out of 3 new cars on \nthe road use our catalysts\nOur marine catalysts reduce \n100k tonnes of NOx annually\nOur industrial catalysts reduce \n11k tonnes of NOx annually\nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 202314\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION\nSynergy in action\nThe energy transition will require a mosaic of different technologies and processes. \nThis is why it’s vital our Clean Air customers are aware of the full offer from Johnson \nMatthey so our new sales approach will provide customers with a much more \ncomprehensive and holistic service. For example, we may be in discussion with a \ncustomer about emissions control and find that their hydrogen division needs support \nin optimising existing infrastructure to support deployment at scale going forward. \nThis is something our Hydrogen Technologies team can support. We know how these \ncustomers operate, and we can help them transition as the powertrain evolves.\nOur performance in 2022/23\nIn Clean Air, we are focused on our target of generating at least £4 billion of cash to 2030/31, \nwhich is underpinned by tightening emission control legislation, business wins, \nmanufacturing\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
