This \nmeans that the greenhouse gases we emit \nas a business and those that we remove \nfrom the atmosphere balance out to zero, \nand we only neutralise residual emissions.\nOur target to achieve Net Zero emissions \nacross our Direct Operations (Scopes \n1+2) is an acceleration on our full net \nzero journey where we have the most \ncontrol and the ability to make significant \nreductions quickly.\nMaking a 95%+ absolute GHG Emission \nreduction on our 2020 baseline is a \nsignificant undertaking but this is the \nscience-based path needed in this \ndecade of action.\nCore to our approach is innovation to help \ninfluence the changes needed to create \nand develop tomorrow’s low-carbon \nsolutions. Find out more here.\nOur commitments are deliberately bold to \nprompt us to act decisively, to give us the \ncredibility to be an advocate for global \nclimate action.\nTo help us achieve our net zero target, we will \nneed to use 100% renewable energy. This \nmeans moving away from fossil-fuels such as \noil and natural gas to protect the earth’s natural \nand finite resources, as well as protecting the \natmosphere from the damaging greenhouse \ngases that burning fossil fuels releases. We’ve \nalready phased out the use of coal in our \noperations and are progressing quickly to using \nonly renewable energy everywhere we operate, \nbuilding on our successes to achieve 83% of \nelectricity from renewable sources and a total of \n41% renewable energy overall. In 2016 we joined \nRE100 and are well on our way to achieving \nour 100% renewable electricity target by 2030. \nWe commit to prioritising energy reductions and \nembedding efficiencies into the way we work.\nOur 2030 emission reduction targets have been approved by Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as meeting a 1.5°C mitigation pathway. These near term, science \nbased targets put us on track to achieve our longer term full net zero commitment in this important decade of action. By driving down our own emissions using an \napproved science based approach we are setting the bar high but we know absolute emission reduction is good for the planet.\nThe SBTi defines and promotes best practice in emissions reductions and net-zero targets in line with climate science. They independently assess and approve companies’ \ntargets, providing key clarity & guidance, to ensure that targets translate into action that is consistent with achieving a net-zero world by no later than 2050.\n50% Reduction in \nSupply Chain Emissions \n(Scope 3)\nNet Zero Emissions \nAcross Direct Operations \n(Scope 1 & 2)\n100% Renewable \nEnergy for Own \nOperations\nOur biggest opportunity to take climate action \nis through our whole ‘grain to glass’ value chain, \nfocusing not only on the emissions that we have \ndirect control over but also playing a role in \nhelping to reduce emissions across our supply \nchain (Scope 3) by half by 2030. Our supply chain \nemissions are by far the biggest part of our carbon \nfootprint. \nHalving our supply chain absolute emissions from \na 2020 baseline year is certainly ambitious and it \nis also aligned to a science based 1.5oC pathway \ntoo.\nWe will partner with our suppliers on renewable \nenergy solutions, innovative design and \nregenerative agriculture to help drive efficiencies \nand emissions reductions.\n\n7\nNET-ZERO EMISSION  \nPATHWAY\nTHIRD PARTY OPERATIONS\nPARTNERING\n \nWITH SUPPLIERS\nALLIANCES &  \nCOLLABORATIONS\nEMPLOYEES\nLOCAL COMMUNITIES\nNATURAL ENVIRONMENT\nINDUSTRY LEADERSHIP\nACCELERATE\n \nCLIMATE ACTION\nBRAND SUSTAINABILITY\nRENEWABLE ELECTRICITY\nRENEWABLE FUEL & HEAT\nENERGY EFFICIENCY\nOPERATIONS SUPPLY CHAIN\nADVOCACY\nCOMMUNITY\nOperations\nWe are working to minimise the emissions \nin our own sites and operations across \nthe world to achieve net zero carbon in \nour direct operations by 2030. The key \nto helping us achieve this is embedding \nenergy efficiency into the way we work, \nand working towards using 100% \nrenewable electricity, fuel and heat.\nOur\nApproach\nOur strategic approach \nis underpinned by four \nkey pillars of action:\nAdvocacy\nWe are an industry leader on climate \nchange action, inspiring others to join \nus in the path to net zero. We support \nseveral critical alliances, goals and \npledges that advocate the rapid global \ntransition to a low carbon economy \nnecessary to fight climate change. \nWe know we can’t do it alone, which \nis why we are focusing on building \ncollective action across our industry, \nengaging with our peers, representative \nbodies & governments to enable a just \ntransition, and importantly accelerate \ndecarbonization outcomes.\nCommunity\nWe are engaging with the communities \nwhere we live, work, source and sell \non climate action. Our ‘grain to glass’ \nsustainability ambition is enabled by \nall stakeholders & groups, from our \nown employees to our customers & \nconsumers.
