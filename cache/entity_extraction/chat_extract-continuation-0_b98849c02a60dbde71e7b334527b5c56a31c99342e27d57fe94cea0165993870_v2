The group is also involved from time to \ntime in the course of its business in legal proceedings and actions, engagement with \nregulatory authorities and in dispute resolution processes. Judgement is required to determine \nif an outflow of economic resources is probable, or possible but not probable for such events. \nWhere it is probable, a liability is recognised and further judgement is used to determine the \namount of the provision. Where it is possible but not probable, further judgement is used to \ndetermine if the likelihood is remote, in which case no disclosures are provided; if the \nlikelihood is not remote then a contingent liability is disclosed. Provisions and contingent \nliabilities are set out in notes 22 and 32, respectively. \nIn the course of preparing the accounts, no other judgements have been made in the process \nof applying the group’s and parent company’s accounting policies, other than those involving \nestimations, that have had a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the accounts. \nChanges in accounting policies \nAmendments to accounting standards \nThe IASB has issued the following amendments, which have been endorsed by the UK \nEndorsement Board, for annual periods beginning on or after 1st January 2022: \n• Annual improvements to IFRS Standards 2018-2020; \n• Amendments to IAS 16, Property, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before intended use; \n• Amendments to IAS 37, Onerous Contracts – Cost of Fulfilling a Contract; and \n• Amendments to IFRS 3, Reference to the Conceptual Framework. \nThese changes have not had a material impact on the group. The group has not early adopted \nany standard, interpretation or amendment that was issued but is not yet effective. \nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 2023 157\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION\nNotes on the Accounts continued for the year ended 31st March 2023 \n158 \n1 Accounting policies continued \nChanges in accounting policies continued \nStandards effective from 1st April 2023 \nIFRS 17, Insurance Contracts, applies to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1st \nJanuary 2023. The new Standard establishes the principles for the recognition, measurement, \npresentation and disclosure of insurance contracts within the scope of the Standard. The \nobjective of IFRS 17 is to ensure that an entity provides relevant information that faithfully \nrepresents those contracts. \nThe group has performed an assessment to establish where an impact is expected and \nconsiders the impact of this new standard to be immaterial. \nNon-GAAP measures \nThe group uses various measures to manage its business which are not defined by generally \naccepted accounting principles (GAAP). The group’s management believes these measures \nprovide valuable additional information to users of the accounts in understanding the group’s \nperformance. The group’s non-GAAP measures are defined and reconciled to GAAP measures \nin note 34.  \n2 Segmental information \nRevenue, sales and underlying operating profit by business \nAs announced in our preliminary full year results in May 2022, we have changed our reporting \nstructure for the year ending 31st March 2023. The new reporting structure provides greater \ntransparency and reflects how we manage our business. Efficient Natural Resources was split \ninto two separate segments (PGM Services and Catalyst Technologies), and Hydrogen \nTechnologies and Value Businesses are now separate operating segments (previously included \nwithin Other Markets). Excluding Corporate, the group has five reporting segments, aligned to \nthe needs of our customers and the global challenges we are tackling.  \nClean Air – provides catalysts for emission control after-treatment systems used in light and \nheavy duty vehicles powered by internal combustion engines. \nPGM Services – enables the energy transition through providing circular solutions as demand \nfor scarce critical materials increases. Provides a strategic service to the group, supporting the \nother segments with security of metal supply, and manufactures value add PGM products. \nCatalyst Technologies – enables the decarbonisation of chemical and fuel value chains. \nHydrogen Technologies – provides catalyst coated membranes that are a critical component \nfor fuel cells and electrolysers. \nValue Businesses – a portfolio of businesses managed to drive shareholder value from \nactivities considered to be non-core to the Group. This includes Battery Systems, Medical \nDevice Components and Diagnostic Services1. Refer to note 27 for further information on the \ndisposal of Battery Materials. Advanced Glass Technologies was sold on 31st January 2022 and \nis included within the prior period balances. \nThe Group Leadership Team (the chief operating decision maker as defined by IFRS 8, \nOperating Segments) monitors the results of these operating sectors to assess performance \nand make decisions about the allocation of resources. Each operating sector is represented by \na member of the Group Leadership Team. These operating sectors represent the group’s \nreportable segments and their principal activities are described on pages 56 to 59. The \nperformance of the group’s operating sectors is assessed on sales and underlying operating \nprofit (see note 34). Sales between segments are made at market prices, taking into account \nthe volumes involved. \nHealth was sold during the financial year and its results are therefore presented within \ndiscontinued operations. Information about this discontinued segment is provided in note 26.  \n1.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>JOHNSON
