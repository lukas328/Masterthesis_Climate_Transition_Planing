We have an adoption rate of 70% for pure Battery Electric Vehicles in our company \ncars and 45% across our entire fleet, including commercial vehicles. \nFluorinated gases\nWe use fluorinated gases (F-gases) in cooling equipment and fire suppression systems. Fugitive \nemissions from the accidental release or leakage of F-gases directly contribute to greenhouse \ngas emissions. We have enhanced methods to prevent the accidental release of F-gases and \nincreasing the use of alternatives with lower Global Warming Potential (GWP) where possible. \nDuring FY24, we reduced our overall holding of FM200 by 33%.\nIntroduction   |  The Detail   |  Completed Projects   |   Future Projects   |   Sign-off \n2024 | Carbon Reduction Plan Vodafone UK   \n8\nCompleted carbon reduction projects\nScope 3 carbon reduction achievements and our partnerships\nThis year we have further invested in enhanced \nEnvironmental, Social, Governance (ESG) \nreporting capabilities to improve the quality \nof our data. As of this year, our Scope 3 data \ndisclosed by Vodafone Group in their annual \nreport has been subject to external assurance.\nVodafone requires key suppliers to set a 1.5°C \nscience-based carbon target and to report on \nenvironmental performance to CDP. Vodafone \nalso launched a new environmentally linked \nsupply chain financing programme in March \n2023, to collaborate with our smaller suppliers \non net zero programmes.\nTo reduce our value chain emissions, we \nintroduced a 20% weighting for environmental \nand social criteria in our supplier evaluation \nRequest for Quote (RFQ) processes. Having \nrobust environmental policies, addressing \ncarbon emissions and using renewable energy \nare all key considerations for selecting and \nworking with our suppliers.\nWe have a CO 2 analytics dashboard for our \nsupply chain teams to view and track progress \nagainst our reduction targets. This helps \nour procurement team to identify suppliers, \nmarkets and categories which contribute higher \nemissions and helps us subsequently work on \nefficiencies with our partners. \nActivities to influence our downstream \nemissions include increasing the range of \nrefurbished devices and we have seen year-on-\nyear sales growth.\nScope 3\nFor our Scope 3 emissions, we have less \ndirect control of reduction activities, greater \nuncertainty about data availability and increased \nreliance on partners in our value chain. We have \nset a trajectory to reduce these emissions from \nour base year (2020) to our near-term target \nyear (2030), and our long-term net zero target \nyear (2040).\nCurrently, one of the key drivers of year-\nto-year trends in our Scope 3 emissions is \nimprovements in the quality of data inputs, \nemission factors or calculation methods. We \ncontinue to invest in improving the quality, \naccessibility and availability of carbon footprint \ndata to enable better measurement and \nreduction of Scope 3 emissions across our \nindustry.\nIntroduction   |  The Detail   |  Completed Projects   |   Future Projects   |   Sign-off \n\n2024 | Carbon Reduction Plan Vodafone UK   9\nPartnerships  \nWe are proud to be signatories to the \nfollowing campaigns:\nUN Global Compact - a voluntary initiative \nthat encourages businesses to adopt \nsustainable and socially responsible policies \nand practices.\nRE100 - a global renewable energy initiative \nbringing together businesses committed to \n100% renewable electricity.\nRace to Zero campaign - a global initiative \naiming to mobilise businesses, cities, \nregions, and investors to achieve net-zero \ncarbon emissions by 2050.\nReporting\nWe report to various disclosure schemes at \nGroup level, including responding to the CDP’s \nclimate change questionnaire since 2010.
