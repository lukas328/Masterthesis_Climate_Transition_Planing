Our climate responsibility is addressed in corporate policies and \nprocedures. We have a training agenda on climate change, as this topic can impact even the compensation of employees and executives. \nStrategy\nRisks and opportunities identified in \nthe short-, medium- and long-terms.\nWe map climate risks and opportunities to which our businesses and operations may be exposed and develop an implementation strategy. We assess our exposure to \ndifferent sectors and opportunities through risk management processes and climate metrics.\nImpact of climate risks and \nopportunities on business, strategy \nand financial planning.\nThe risks and opportunities identified influence our strategy, which is focused on the adoption of stakeholder engagement actions and measures to reduce the impacts of \nclimate change on the bank’s business and operations. \nWe develop products and services by taking into consideration their impacts on climate change, set emission reduction targets for our operation and the power \ngeneration and coal generation sectors as well, as these are the sectors to be prioritized according to the NZBA commitment. We also act on to support farming production \ndecarbonization, in addition to encouraging the carbon credit market. \nResilience of the organization’s \nstrategy, taking into account \ndifferent climate scenarios.\nWe address different climate scenarios to guide our risk management processes and define our sector decarbonization targets and commercial ambition. Based on the \nNet-Zero scenario of the International Energy Agency (IEA), targets are in line with pathway to 1.5°C. These exercises defined Itaú’s commercial strategy and ambition to be \nin a position as the climate transition bank for our clients.\n3 \nItaú Unibanco Holding S.A.climate report 2022\nRisk Management\nProcesses for identifying and \nassessing climate-related risks.\nWe have developed a methodology to identify climate risks – both physical and transition – in the short, medium and long terms. We are attentive to the progress of the \nregulatory agenda that may impact our business and operations.\nProcesses for managing \nclimate-related risks.\nWe adopt measures to address climate risks in assessments of clients, loans, and other operations with a focus on increasing our resilience. We also monthly monitor the \nloan portfolio exposure to physical and transition risks, with regular reports according to our governance risk structure.\nIntegration of the processes \nfor identifying, assessing and \nmanaging climate-related risks into \nthe overall risk management.\nWe map the transmission channels that connect climate risks to other traditional risk disciplines, such as credit and reputational risks. Based on these connections, we \nmanage climate risk in an integrated way by strengthening the bank's risk management processes, which are supported by a robust governance framework based on the \nthree lines of defense methodology.\nMetrics and Targets\nMetrics used by the institution \nto assess climate risks and \nopportunities.\nWe adopt specific metrics for managing climate risks and opportunities in connection with our business and operations. We actively take part in global discussions focused \non building new metrics, as well as on the progress of emission quantification calculations and methodologies.\nScope 1, 2 and 3 emissions and \nrelated risks.\nWe measure scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions from the bank’s operations and financed emissions by applying the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) \nmethodology. In 2022, performance was as follows:\nScope 11: 22.925 tCO₂e\nScope 2 by choice of purchase2: 2.537 tCO₂e\nScope 3, except financed emissions3: 41.659 tCO₂e\nFinanced emissions4: 20,600,000 tCO₂e\nTargets used to manage climate \nrisks and opportunities.\nOur goal is achieving net-zero by 2050, with intermediate targets for sectors and our operations. Considering the current available technological, our efforts have enabled \nus to make headway in the following targets:\nA 63% reduction in the intensity of financed emissions of the power generation sector by 2030.\nPhasing out financial transactions in the thermal coal sector by 2030.\nAllocation of R$400 billion to ESG and climate-related positive impact sectors by 2025.\nHaving 80% of our branches run on renewable energy by 2025.\nRecommendation Description and strategic priorities\n1 It includes Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay. | 2 It includes Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay. |  3 It includes Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay. | 4 It includes all Itaú’s financed emissions, will global reach.\n4 \nItaú Unibanco Holding S.A.climate report 2022\nabout this report\nThis report presents our climate strategy, in line with the recommendation of the TCFD on \nGovernance, Strategy, Risk Management and Climate Metrics and Targets.
