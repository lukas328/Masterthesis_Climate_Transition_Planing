Remuneration Report 2022 \navailable on vestas �com�\nProduct design governance  \nand assessment\nVestas Way to Market \nWe consider sustainability throughout design and development, a \nprocess which we call the Vestas Way to Market � We use this \nframework to plan, manage, and execute technology and product \ndevelopment across the value chain, while maintaining a firm focus \non customer requirements � By involving relevant stakeholders in the \ndevelopment process, we can build requirements into the product \ndesign at an early stage � \nVestas Way to Market is a stage-gate process, with a group of \ngatekeepers positioned at each milestone � This approach helps us to \ndecide whether to progress a project to the next stage and ensures \nthat specification requirements are met � The specifications are \nbased on internal commitments (such as the Prohibited and \nRestricted Substances document), international legislation (such as \nEuropean directives), internationally recognised codes and \nstandards set by organisations such as the American Society of \nMechanical Engineers (ASME), the International Organization for \nStandardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical \nCommission (IEC), and commitments in our sustainability strategy � \nFor example, in 2022 we integrated targets to reduce CO 2e and \nwaste generated within the product design of future turbines �\nLife cycle assessment (LCA)\nSince 1999, we have developed LCAs to provide a ‘cradle-to-grave’ \nevaluation of the environmental impacts made by our products and \nactivities � In these LCAs we focus on two key actions: \n• Documenting the environmental performance of Vestas  \nwind turbines \n• Analysing results to improve or develop wind turbines with  \nless environmental impact \nThe studies assess each wind turbine’s entire bill-of-material, \naccounting for the approximately 25,000 parts that make up a \nsingle turbine � In our LCAs, we conduct a complete assessment of a \nwind power plant, up to the point of connection with the electricity \ngrid� This includes the wind turbine itself, its foundation, site cabling, \nand transformer station � \nIn 2022, we engaged with a taskforce within WindEurope to help \nstandardise LCA approaches among major western turbine \nmanufacturers � In time, we expect this collaboration to improve the \ncomparability of LCA results in the wind industry � All published LCAs \nare accessible on our corporate website � \nVestas SiteLCA™ \nWe offer our customers the opportunity to receive a customised Life \nCycle Assessment of their own wind power plants � We call this \nservice a Vestas SiteLCA™ � Each assessment determines key \nindicators of environmental performance and takes the wind turbine \ntype, site-specific conditions, and production supply chain into \nconsideration � \nThe environmental performance of wind power plants varies across \nthe globe � For this reason, SiteLCA™ provides our customers with \nfocused and transparent environmental facts, such as a specific \nwind plant’s carbon footprint, return on-energy, or water-use � These \nfact-based indicators increase business case certainty by support -\ning a customer’s energy strategy � They also support project planning \nand permitting processes, for example regarding decommissioning, \nand public consultation and response �\nFor more information, please see the Vestas SiteLCA™ brochure on \nour corporate website � \nManagement systems\nThe Vestas Management System enables us to put all external and \ninternal sustainability requirements into practice systematically, \nefficiently, and effectively � It is a key to our intent to make sustaina -\nbility an integral component of all business processes � In order to \nfurther demonstrate a commitment to meeting the highest \nstandards of health, safety, and the environment, our operations are \nbuilt on global certificates for ISO 9001 for Quality, ISO 14001 for \nEnvironment, and ISO 45001 for Health and Safety � \nVestas Sustainability Report 2022\nGeneralIn brief GovernanceEnvironment Sustainability dataSocial Appendix\n23\nStakeholder engagement \nWhile the materiality assessment reflects a focused approach to \nalign our sustainability strategy with our most important stakehold -\ners, as a global company we interact with a large array of different \nstakeholder groups � These include customers, shareholders and \ninvestors, employees, policy makers, suppliers, non-governmental \norganisations, local communities, and the media � Our sustainability \nperformance is an important part of our relationship with these \ngroups� By proactively engaging with stakeholders to understand \ntheir needs and concerns, we can feed this information back into our \ndecision-making process �\nWe have both categorised and prioritised stakeholders to rationalise \nand focus our engagement efforts � This exercise is based on the \ndegree to which they influence Vestas’ performance and are \naffected by it, as well as their interest in Vestas � Engagement ranges \nfrom forming active partnerships to address common sustainability \nissues, to more passive engagement through, for example, the \npublication of the Vestas Annual Sustainability Report � We use the \npriority given to each stakeholder to determine the most appropri -\nate approach to engagement � \nTransparency is fundamental to our engagement strategy and \nunderpins our many engagement efforts � We publicly disclose key \nsustainability information in our Sustainability Report � Additionally, \nwe regularly lead more detailed dialogues with key stakeholders, as \nwell as keeping day-to-day contact with customers and holding \nannual events such as our Supplier Forum � \nSupplier engagement\nEvery year we host the Supplier Forum where we engage with our \nmost critical suppliers and share expectations for the future \ndevelopment of the renewable energy industry � The Supplier Forum \ncreates a platform to share business perspectives and expectations \nwith our suppliers who represent a large pool of resources and \nnetworks � We want to
