The Policy focuses \non mitigating the risks to the core focus of the \nsustainability strategy, with wider ESG topics having \nbeen integrated into other Enterprise Risk Policies, such \nas People, Suppliers and Brand & Reputation. The Policy \nrequires Bupa’s Market Units to build sustainability \nplans into their business plans and ensures consistent \nmonitoring of performance against targets. \nLiaison with other Committees \nThe Committee liaises with other Committees of \nthe Board as necessary, including with: the Audit \nCommittee, to review sustainability and ESG disclosures \nin the Annual Report and Accounts each year; the \nRemuneration Committee, to ensure that sustainability \nand ESG matters are appropriately considered in setting \nBupa’s remuneration policy; and the Risk Committee on \nrelevant risks such as climate change-related financial \nrisks.
