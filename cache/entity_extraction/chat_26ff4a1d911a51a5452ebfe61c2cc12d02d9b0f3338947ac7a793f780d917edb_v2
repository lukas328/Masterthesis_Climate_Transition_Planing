GFANZ acknowledges \nthat the act of developing net-zero transition plans \nwill vary by jurisdiction and will depend on the  \nindividual characteristics of each financial institution, \nincluding size, business model, sector coverage, \nand other factors. The following recommendations \nand guidance use a principles-based approach to \nallow for such flexibility, but GFANZ encourages \nfinancial institutions to address all components \nwhere possible. We have included examples and \ncase studies to illustrate specific elements of the \nguidance in practice at the time of writing. \nGFANZ also acknowledges that supporting \npathways, tools, and methodologies may not  \nbe available for all situations, but expects that \nimplementation of specific components will  \nmature and change over time as financial  \ninstitutions develop and execute net-zero transition \nplans more widely, and as the circumstances — \nincluding risks, opportunities, and regulatory \nconsiderations — evolve.\nPlease refer to the “How to read this report ” at \nthe beginning of this report for the overarching \nconsiderations the reader should keep in mind \nwhen reading the following recommendations \nand guidance. These include the voluntary nature \nof the recommendations and guidance, the need \nto interpret this guidance within the financial \ninstitution’s individual business characteristics and \njurisdictions within which it operates, and from an \nimplementation rather than disclosure point of view. \nFigure 8.

Joining one of the net-zero sector-specific alliances \nadds credibility, as does a statement from a senior executive communicating the institution’s net-zero \nobjective and priority areas. Many ambition statements will be defined by the commitments of the sector-\nspecific alliance the financial institution joined. However, there is some flexibility in defining the specific \nobjectives, scope, and approaches to achieving the targets, including allowance for more ambitious goals.\nFinancial institutions will take different approaches to achieving net-zero targets and prioritize areas of \ntheir business depending on factors including the size of the organization, their business model, influence, \noperating environment, portfolio and client characteristics, and geographic coverage. As detailed in the \n“Defining transition finance” section, the key financing strategies that financial institutions may choose \nto prioritize are focused on financing climate solutions, supporting already aligned firms, supporting real-\neconomy firms committed to aligning, and financing managed phaseout projects. Defining these priorities \nallows an institution to develop a detailed and strategic net-zero transition plan. The plan, guided by the \nobjectives and priorities, will include decisions such as resourcing, incentives, which analytical processes \nto modify, and how to adapt priority business units, products and services, engagement plans, and other \ncore business levers.7576\n1) COMPONENT: OBJECTIVES AND PRIORITIES\nOverview and relevance: Clear net-zero objectives \nalong with priority key financing strategies provide \nclarity to internal stakeholders; allow external \nstakeholders to assess the appropriateness of the \nproposed actions against the stated ambition; and \nallow one financial institution’s transition objectives \nto be compared to its peers. \nGuidance: A financial institution should articulate \nits transition objectives and how they will be \nembedded within the wider organization and \ncorporate strategy.\nRecommendation\nDefine the organization’s objectives to reach \nnet zero by 2050 or sooner, in line with science\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
