We \nhave also set interim goals to reduce \nour financed emissions intensity by \n25% by 2025 and by at least 50% by \n20301. These targets help drive efforts \nacross the business, and to transpose \nour long-term net zero ambition into \nmeaningful interim steps which serve \nas critical milestones on the journey.\nOur 2025 target covers all listed equity and credit \n(c. £160 billion) and our 2030 target covers all \nassets at a Group level where we can exercise \ncontrol and influence (c. £250 billion) – see figure 14.\nOur approach to setting our interim \ndecarbonisation targets for 2025 and 2030 \nfollows recognised protocols as developed by the \nNet Zero Asset Owner Alliance (‘NZAOA’) . We \nengaged with an expert consultancy to calibrate \nand ensure the suitability of our decarbonisation \ntargets, and in particular referred to transition \nscenarios produced by the International Energy \nAgency (‘IEA’) and the Intergovernmental Panel on \nClimate Change (‘IPCC’).
