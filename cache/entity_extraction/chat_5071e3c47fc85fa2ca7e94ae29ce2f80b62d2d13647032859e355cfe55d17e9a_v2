As a consequence, the results and balances for the Group's \nTurkish operations have been adjusted for changes in the general purchasing power of the Turkish lira. In order \nto make this adjustment the Group refers to the consumer price index (CPI) published by the Turkish Statistical \nInstitute. The value of CPI at 31 December 2022 was 1,128.40 and the movement in CPI for the year ended \n31 December 2022 was 441.45, an increase of 64.3%. A loss of £87m arising from the devaluation of net monetary \nassets has been recognised within net financial expense in the Consolidated Income Statement. This is partially \noffset by the impact of indexing amounts in the Consolidated Income Statement for the application of IAS 29, \nwith the net impact reducing profit before tax by £31m for the year. \nAll Turkish lira amounts, including transactions in the Income Statement during the year, are translated to the \nGroup's presentation currency of sterling, using the closing exchange rate in effect on 31 December 2022 of 22.58. \nThe impact of this adjustment is recorded within other foreign exchange translation differences in the Consolidated \nStatement of Comprehensive Income and within the foreign exchange translation reserve in the Consolidated \nStatement of Financial Position. The Group recognises the remaining exchange difference arising on consolidation \nwithin other foreign exchange translation differences through other comprehensive income in the foreign exchange \ntranslation reserve. \nPrior periods have not been restated for the introduction of hyperinflation. The impact as at 1 January 2022 has \nbeen recorded as an opening balance adjustment in the current year. This includes an adjustment of £(84)m to the \nincome and expenditure reserve in respect of adjusting balances for changes in the general purchasing power of \nthe Turkish lira to that date, and adjustments to the foreign exchange translation reserve of £105m for the impact \nof translating the opening balances using the closing 31 December 2021 exchange rates, in addition to the \nremaining exchange differences arising on consolidation. \nThe split of the opening balance adjustment is consistent with how the current period impacts are reported and will \nbe applied consistently in future years. Of the opening balance adjustment of £21m, £(6)m is in respect of deferred \ntax and is shown in Note 11; £25m is in respect of goodwill and intangible assets and is shown in Note 3; £6m is in \nrespect of deferred acquisition costs and is shown in Note 12; and £(4)m is in respect of unearned premium \nprovision and is shown in Note 19. The net impact of applying hyperinflationary accounting has been excluded from \nunderlying profit and included within realised and unrealised FX gains/losses as this is how the Group measures \nperformance of the business. \nBupa Annual Report 2022 131 \n \n \n \n   \n           \n          \n           \n           \n            \n          \n         \n          \n \n   \n          \n             \n  \n            \n             \n             \n \n \n        \n            \n              \n              \n             \n     \n       \n              \n  \n      \n      \n      \n \n \n            \n        \n         \n            \n    \n           \n          \n   \n            \n          \n      \n   \nStrategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements \nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \ncontinued \nOperating segments in brief Note 2: \nThe organisational structure of the Group is managed through three Market \nOperating Units based on geographic locations and customers: Bupa Asia Pacific; \nEurope and Latin America; and Bupa Global and UK.
