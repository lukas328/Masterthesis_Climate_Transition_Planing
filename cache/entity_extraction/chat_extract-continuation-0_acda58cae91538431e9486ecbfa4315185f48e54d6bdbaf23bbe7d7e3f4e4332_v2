Sustainability Report 2022\nEnvironmentIn brief General Governance Sustainability dataSocial Appendix\nBiodiversity preservation\nBuilding a zero- \nwaste turbine through \ncircular economy\nCircular economy\nIn 2021 we released our Circularity Roadmap, \nbecoming the first organisation in the wind \nindustry - and one of the first in any sector  \n- to translate the theory of circular economy  \ninto actionable targets and goals� \nOur roadmap, will help us reduce waste across the value chain, with \nthe ultimate ambition of producing zero-waste wind turbines by \n2040� The roadmap is based on three key areas: design, operations, \nand material recovery\nDesign for circularity\nMaterial efficiency\nBy 2030, we aim to increase our material efficiency by 90 percent � \nOur initial focus is on blade manufacturing, the process which \ncreates the most internal waste � To achieve this, we will raise \nawareness within our factories, optimise blade design and produc -\ntion methods, source more efficient manufacturing kits, and make \ncircularity metrics key performance indicators � \nDuring 2022, our material efficiency improved 20 percent to 1� 6 \ntonnes of non-recycled waste per MW produced and shipped, \ncompared to 2 �0 in 2021� To further increase material efficiency,  \nwe are optimising the use of carbon, glass fabric, and chemicals in \nour blade manufacturing processes � We are also running initiatives \nto map out waste streams in all areas of manufacturing and further \nreduce the use of materials through waste reductions in design  \nand packaging � \nBlade and turbine recyclability \nWe are significantly accelerating our ambition around blade \nrecyclability, pushing the boundaries of circularity by creating a  \ntruly circular blade � As well as commiting to create a rotor that can  \nbe 100 percent recycled, we are minimising the down-cycling of \nblade materials � \nWhile recent innovations have enabled us to recycle blades in some \nregions, the materials recovered from these processes are signifi -\ncantly down-cycled � Under our new target, the value of such \nmaterials will be preserved, enabling recovery and reuse in new \nturbines or similar devices � \nBeyond blades, we are also working to integrate recyclability \nrequirements across the full turbine structure � To achieve a ze-\nro-waste wind turbine, we are investigating new recycling pathways \nfor difficult-to-recycle materials� Our ambition is to redesign the \nturbine or develop new circularity routes so that every component  \nwill be recyclable by 2040� \nOur large scale blade recycling project continues in the USA, where \nin 2022 we recycled 475 blades in total (compared with 285 blades \nin 2021), including nacelle and hub covers � Recycling can include \ncement co-processing, gasification, forming new composite \nmaterials, and reclaiming glass fibre and carbon fibres � We are \nexploring opportunities to offer these services beyond the USA in \nregions where local recycling infrastructure is robust and customer \ndemand can be established � \nIn 2021, the CETEC (Circular Economy for Thermosets Epoxy \nComposites) initiative, spearheaded by Vestas, has significnatly \nadvanced solutions for composite circularity � CETEC technology \nenables circularity for thermoset composites, which constitute the \nmajority of turbine blade mass � \nThrough the CETEC recycling route, we can disassemble the epoxy \nresin from fibres � Then, we can break down epoxy into its base \ncomponents and reutilise the high-value building blocks in the \nmanufacture of new turbine blades � In addition, the CETEC process \nwill help to solve circularity challenges in other sectors that use \ncomposite materials, such as automotive and aviation �
