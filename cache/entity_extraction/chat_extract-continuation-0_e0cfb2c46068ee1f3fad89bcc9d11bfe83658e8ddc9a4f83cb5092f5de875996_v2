We also find that the non-financial reward elements \nare essential to a supportive culture, with the wellbeing of staff a prominent part of our \nemployment proposition.\nThe general principle for remuneration in Johnson Matthey is to provide a competitive \npackage of pay and benefits in all markets and at all job levels to attract and retain \nhigh-quality and diverse employees. Equal and fair pay is also a critical component of our \nproposition, and we regularly review our pay levels and develop actions to remove any form \nof potential inequality. The proportion of variable pay increases with progression through \nmanagement levels, with the highest proportion of variable pay at executive director level, \nas defined by the Remuneration Policy.\nThis year, all employees were able to provide their feedback on a range of matters, including \nremuneration, through The Big Listen and our annual employee engagement survey \n(YourSay). This provided valuable employee context to decision making when considering \nchanges to the Remuneration Policy. While we inform our employees of global changes \nto pay and benefits, we have not actively sought a two-way dialogue over executive pay \nduring 2022/23.\n Corporate Governance: matthey.com/corporate-governance\nThe table below sets out how our remuneration arrangements cascade through the organisation:\nExecutive directors Senior managers Middle managers Managers Wider workforce\nBase salary Base salary is set with reference to the relevant local market and takes account of the employee’s knowledge, experience and \ncontribution to the role. Base salaries are usually reviewed annually and take into account local salary norms, local inflation \nand business conditions. Increases in base salary for directors will take into account the level of salary increases granted to all \nemployees within the group.\nBase salary is either subject \nto negotiation with local \ntrade unions or follows the \nmarket pay approach \noutlined for managers.\nPension and benefits Employment-related benefits are offered in line with local market conditions.\nShort-term\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>JOHNSON MATTHEY<|><|ORGANIZATION<|>Johnson Matthey is a global specialty chemicals and sustainable technologies company, involved in activities such as developing and implementing sustainability frameworks, managing incentive plans, and setting remuneration policies for its leadership and employees)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIAM CONDON<|><|PERSON<|>Liam Condon is an executive director at Johnson Matthey, responsible for overseeing remuneration scenarios and strategic planning related to employee compensation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STEPHEN OXLEY<|><|PERSON<|>Stephen Oxley is an executive director at Johnson Matthey, involved in developing remuneration packages and strategic employee reward initiatives)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GROUP EMPLOYEE<|><|ORGANIZATION<|>The group employee refers to the broader workforce of Johnson Matthey, whose pay and benefits are considered in the company's remuneration policies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REMEDIATION COMMITTEE<|><|ORGANIZATION<|>The Remuneration Committee is responsible for exercising discretion in incentive plans, setting remuneration policies, and ensuring fair compensation practices within Johnson Matthey)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023<|><|EVENT<|>The document providing detailed information on Johnson Matthey's financial performance, governance, and remuneration policies for the year 2023)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY<|><|EVENT<|>A formal policy outlining the principles and practices for compensating Johnson Matthey's directors and executives)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PERFORMANCE SCENARIOS<|><|EVENT<|>Different potential future remuneration outcomes based on various performance levels, including below threshold, threshold, target, and maximum scenarios)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT SURVEY<|><|EVENT<|>An internal survey called \"YourSay\" used by Johnson Matthey to gather employee feedback on remuneration and workplace conditions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GROUP LEADERSHIP TEAM<|><|ORGANIZATION<|>The senior management team at Johnson Matthey involved in strategic decision-making, including remuneration considerations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOCAL MARKET<|><|GEO<|>Johnson Matthey sets base salaries with reference to local market conditions, inflation, and business environment in various regions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REWARD<|><|EVENT<|>The overall compensation and benefits strategy aimed at attracting and retaining high-quality employees across Johnson Matthey)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTEGRATED REMUNERATION<|><|EVENT<|>The structured approach combining fixed and variable pay elements, including bonuses, share plans, and benefits, to motivate employees and align with company performance)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOHNSON MATTHEY<|>REMEDIATION COMMITTEE<|>The Remuneration Committee manages and exercises discretion over Johnson Matthey's remuneration policies<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LIAM CONDON<|>JOHNSON MATTHEY<|>Liam Condon is an executive director involved in developing remuneration scenarios and strategic planning<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STEPHEN OXLEY<|>JOHNSON MATTHEY<|>Stephen Oxley is an executive director involved in developing remuneration scenarios and strategic planning<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GROUP EMPLOYEE<|>JOHNSON MATTHEY<|>The group employee is the broader workforce whose pay and benefits are considered in the company's remuneration policies<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023<|>JOHNSON MATTHEY<|>The report provides comprehensive details on the company's financial and governance practices, including remuneration<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY<|>JOHNSON MATTHEY<|>The policy outlines the principles guiding executive and director compensation<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PERFORMANCE SCENARIOS<|>JOHNSON MATTHEY<|>Different remuneration outcomes are modeled based on performance levels<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT SURVEY<|>JOHNSON MATTHEY<|>The survey gathers employee feedback to inform remuneration and workplace policies<|>6)\n##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
