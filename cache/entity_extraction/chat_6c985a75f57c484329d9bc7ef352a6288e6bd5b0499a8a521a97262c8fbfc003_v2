This has resulted in improved PCAF data quality scores for Energy and Power financed \nemissions from 2020 to 2021. As more clients directly reported their emissions, we were able to \nreduce the number of estimates we utilize when calculating our emissions metrics; our scores \nare higher as disclosures and verified data become available. However , climate-related reporting \ncontinues to fall short of the necessary quality, quantity and consistency to permit comparability \nacross clients, industries and sectors, which underscores the necessity of client-level engagement. \nWith respect to financed emissions, a number of important variables create year-to-year volatility \nin reported figures and distort meaningful analyses of client decarbonization progress. These can \ninclude equity market volatility, transitory spikes or falls at year-end in committed client capital, \ndata transitioning from estimates to reported actuals and a client’s own reporting consistency or \ncadence. An example includes material equity market value fluctuations in the enterprise value of \npublic companies, which may impact Enterprise Value Including Cash (EVIC), and subsequently, the \nresults of PCAF calculations.\nWe believe, therefore, that our stakeholders should assess our progress using a number of metrics. \nThis includes PCAF financed emissions calculated with committed funds, normalized PCAF results \nthat control for EVIC fluctuations, and physical intensity, financial intensity and data quality scores, \namong others. However , we also expect that as these challenges are systemically addressed and data \ngaps are closed, the year on year metrics will become more meaningful to determining progress. Our \nfinanced emissions data for the various sectors are disclosed in the “Metrics & Targets” section of \nthis report. \nCarbon Credits   \nCiti intends to meet our 2030 financed emissions targets through real reductions in financed \nemissions. Our priority is to help our clients as they seek to reduce emissions. We do not plan to \npurchase carbon credits ourselves to reach our interim targets. However , we recognize that some \nactivities, such as agricultural and industrial processes and energy-related activities, may not \nachieve absolute zero emissions by 2050. These industries provide products and services that are \nimportant to society and are likely to remain relevant in the future. In these instances, we intend to \nfocus on credits that are additional, certified and restricted to carbon removals. Currently, however , \nremoval technology remains largely limited and costly and therefore, cannot be relied on as an \nalternative to cross-sector emissions reductions. The market for nature-based removal credits is \nsomewhat more developed, and we see important co-benefits to biodiversity and emerging markets \ndevelopment as this market grows. \nTCFD REPORT 2022: CITI’S APPROACH TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND NET ZERO | 27\nClimate Opportunities  \nSustainable Finance  \nIn April 2021, Citi established its $1 Trillion Sustainable Finance by 2030 Commitment, comprising of \nenvironmental and social criteria. Our commitment aligns with the agenda of the UN SDGs, including \naffordable and clean energy through investment in industries, companies and technologies that will ensure \nthe transition to a low-carbon economy. The environmental criteria within the goal are intended to support \ninnovation and collective action through the financing and facilitation of a wide array of climate solutions, \nsuch as renewable energy, clean technology, water conservation and sustainable transportation and social \ncriteria such as affordable housing, economic inclusion, food security and healthcare. For further detail on \nour $1 Trillion Sustainable Finance Commitment, please see the “Metrics & Targets” section of this Report.\nClean Energy Transition  \nTo address the needs of clients involved in energy transition and sustainability, Citi has established a \ndedicated Clean Energy Transition (CET) group. CET offers the suite of Citi’s corporate and investment \nbanking products and services to help companies involved in energy transition execute on their business \nplans and achieve scale. CET is part of Citi’s Natural Resources & Clean Energy Transition (NRCET) group \nthat also houses Citi’s Energy, Power and Chemicals teams that focus on advising corporate clients on \nstrategic matters including energy transition. \nRelated to our focus on new climate technology opportunities, Citi has acted as an agent and/or advisor \nin capital raising for early stage and growth companies. Citi has significant experience in the advisory and \ncapital raising space with respect to the energy transition in the form of private raises for this purpose. For \nexample, Citi has helped raise $3 billion in capital for companies in this market during 2022.\nFor our operational emissions, we remain firmly focused on our 2030 emissions reduction goal. \nWe also recognize the potential of the voluntary carbon markets to support clean technology and \nnature. We intend to begin purchasing voluntary credits to match our Scope 1 GHG emissions for \n2022 and beyond. These credits are being purchased to complement our 100% renewable electricity \ncommitment, which we have met by purchasing renewable electricity attributes, where feasible, in \nthe country where the electricity is used by facilities. Where it is not feasible to source renewable \nelectricity within country, we are purchasing an equivalent amount of renewable electricity in \nregionally aligned markets to further support renewable electricity markets. We will continue to \nevaluate the availability of removal credits to offset any remaining emissions as we near our 2030 \noperational target.\n28 | TCFD REPORT 2022: CITI’S APPROACH TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND NET ZERO\nClean Energy Tech & Meeting Energy Demands  \nWe believe that, in some circles, the net zero dialogue has focused too much on driving down \nemissions from high-carbon sectors, such as Oil and Gas, and not enough on the climate technology \nsolutions that will be required to reduce emissions while continuing to extend access to energy and \nto\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
