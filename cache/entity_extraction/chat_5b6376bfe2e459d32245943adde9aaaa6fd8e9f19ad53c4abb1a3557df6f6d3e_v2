Ensuring we have a high-performance culture is critical to the execution \nof our new strategy. We are creating a more market-focused, agile and less bureaucratic \nJohnson Matthey – one where our people can be truly customer focused and thrive in their \nroles. Like our peers, as well as businesses across the global economy, the labour market \nwe operate within remained competitive in 2022/23. This makes attracting the best talent \nas well as supporting, engaging and developing the people we have hugely important.\nBuilding an engaged, high-performance culture\nImmediately after the launch of our refreshed strategy this year, we initiated town halls and \nteam sessions at all levels in the organisation with the purpose of fully communicating the \noverall strategy and our three core play to win behaviours:\nPeople: Promoting a safe, diverse and equitable society continued\nTake accountability Keep it simple Drive results\nTo accentuate these behaviours we initiated a leader-led culture change programme focused \non upskilling people managers and leaders in key areas such as giving feedback to drive \nperformance, and we started work on a new approach to performance management that \nfocuses on the outcomes and results we want to achieve. \nAn engaged, passionate workforce is the fuel for our transformation. It underpins our whole \nplay to win philosophy and drives us forward in our purpose of catalysing the net zero transition, \nbecoming more customer-focused and unlocking the full value of our operations. We recognise \nthat an important vehicle to driving engagement is all people managers having the ability to \nregularly track status, progression and provide input for areas of focus relevant to their teams. \nTo this end, we have adopted ‘WorkDay Peakon’, a globally recognised tool for our regular \nemployee engagement surveys. Further we have decided to increase the frequency of the full \nsurvey to annual, and to conduct regular pulse surveys to keep on top of any issues. \nOur first full Workday Peakon survey was conducted in March 2023 and we achieved a score \nof 6.9. The methodology used by Workday Peakon is not directly comparable with the tool we \nused previously and thus we have not compared the results with past engagement surveys at JM. \nHowever, we do recognise that 6.9 places us below the industry average of Workday Peakon \nusers. Whilst this is not where we want to be, this is not surprising given the pace and depth \nof transformation we are currently undergoing. We have set ourselves targets of 7.2 by end of \n2024/25 and a score of greater than 8 by 2030, to move us into an industry leadership position.\nWe also recognise that engagement is primarily built in the day-to-day interactions with \ncolleagues, which is why many engagement initiatives have also been run locally at sites and \nin offices. The initiatives take many shapes and forms and adapt to the local opportunities. \nTo accelerate our work on building engagement in the coming year, we will be increasing \nour training and support to help managers build engagement across their teams, as well \nas continuing to examine our employee proposition and culture and making improvements.\nA step change in leadership skills and critical capabilities\nWinning requires us to build critical capabilities, ensure we retain experienced colleagues in JM \ntoday and provide them with opportunities to develop and progress. We have looked to build \nthe leadership capabilities of the organisation this year. We put in place processes to build \na more robust and diverse leadership pipeline.\nA big success this year were the leadership masterclasses in which 135 of our senior leaders \nparticipated. These brought our new strategy to life and drove our culture transformation \nforward. The workshops focused on the behavioural change that underpins transformation \n– storytelling, coaching for performance, accountability and setting objectives. Another 1,663 \nemployees participated in one or more of our general business skill courses.\nWe have 53 graduates in our two-year graduate programmes, who we continue to develop to \nbecome the leaders of the future as they complete eight-month rotations around the company. \nWe have also focused on building our commercial muscle, through the creation of the Group \nCommercial Council, which aims to make the voice of the customer front and centre across JM. \nWith the deployment of our play to win strategy, our whole leadership population will be \nreceiving commercial training in the coming year. \nIn order to win, we must operate efficiently and make the most of our investments for the \nfuture. We know from feedback through our benchmarking that our current organisation needs \nto change to deliver our new strategy. During the year we worked to transform the operating \nmodels for our enabling functions, putting in place new organisations for engineering and \ncapital projects. More work is being progressed to sharpen further and reduce costs more \nquickly in 2023/24.\nBuilding engagement takes time. Activities we initiated this year to start this journey include: \n• We re-clarified our expectations of people managers and their role in engaging and \ndeveloping their people. We have developed a programme of work to educate and train all \nour managers and equip them to motivate and develop their people\n• We have reviewed our approach to major elements of our reward and incentives programmes \nto drive and recognise high-performance outcomes and are implementing the changes for \n2023/24\n• We introduced Workday as a global platform for our people data, giving managers valuable \ninsight into how we can increase retention and streamline processes around activities such as \nsuccession planning\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
