(Clarified) \nConfirmation standards: \nWillingness to take measures against transition risks, development of the strategy, setting of \nquantitative targets, target levels, specificity of means of achievement and status of efforts, \nperformance and objectivity, etc. \n・ We carefully consider whether or not to continue our business with a client in the event that \nthe client is not willing to address transition risk and has not formulated a transition strategy \neven one year after the initial engagement. \nCoal-fired power generation\n \n・ We do not provide financing or investment to companies with which we have no current \ncredit transactions if the primary business of these companies is coal-fired power \ngeneration. \n・ We do not provide financing or investment which will be used for new construction of coal-\nfired power plants or the expansion of existing plants (the same applies to replacement of \nexisting power plants). \n・ We will continue to support development of innovative, clean, and efficient next-generation \ntechnology that will contribute to the expansion of sustainable energy, as well as other \ninitiatives for the transition to a low-carbon society. \nThermal coal mining \n \n・ Our decisions regarding financing and investment for coal mining projects involve a \nthorough examination of the impacts on the environment, industrial safety and health, and \nother areas. \n・ We do not provide financing or investment to companies with which we have no current \ncredit transactions if the primary business of these companies is the mining of thermal coal. \n・ We do not provide financing or investment which will be used for new thermal coal mining \nprojects or for expansion of existing mining projects. \n・ For cases where it will be used to obtain the rights to an existing thermal coal mining \nproject, we may provide financing or investment, based on careful consideration, only when \nit is vital to the stable energy supply of a country which has announced a target of net-zero \ngreenhouse gas emissions by 2050. \nOil and gas\n \n・ Our decisions regarding financing and investment for oil and gas projects involve a thorough \nexamination of the impacts on the environment and of the potential for conflicts with \nindigenous peoples or local communities. \n・ When providing financing or investment that will be used for oil or gas extraction in the Arctic, \noil sands, shale oil, and shale gas extraction, and pipeline, we carry out appropriate \nenvironmental and social risk assessments. \nLarge-scale agriculture\n \n・ Our business decisions involve a thorough examination of whether there are any potential \nconflicts involving indigenous peoples or local communities, and we take into consideration \nwhether the client/project is addressing environmental and social issues and has received \ninternational certification. \n・ We urge clients to formulate policies to respect Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC) \nand practice No Deforestation, No Peat, and No Exploitation (NDPE), and to strengthen \nsupply chain management and improve traceability to ensure the same applies to their \nentire supply chain. \n・ In the palm oil sector, we require that all plantations be certified by the Roundtable on \nSustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). When the client does not have any plans to be certified by \nthe RSPO, we ask that they take measures equivalent to those required for the certification \nand periodically report the status of said measures. \n・ In the lumber and pulp sector, when financing and investing in lumbering businesses in \ncountries that are not among the OECD high-income member states, we request them to \nobtain certification from the Forest Stewardship Council or Programme for the Endorsement \nof Forest Certification. When the client needs more time to obtain certification, we ask that \nthey formulate a plan with a set deadline to do so. \nPalm oil\n \nLumber and pulp\n \n  \n2018\n 2019\n 2020\n 2021\n 2022\n2018\n 2019\n 2020\n 2021\n 2022\n2018 2019\n 2020\n 2021\n 2022\n2018 2019\n 2020\n 2021\n 2022\n2018 2019 2020\n 2021\n 2022\n2018 2019\n 2020\n 2021\n 2022\n2018 2019\n 2020 2021\n 2022\nCEO message\nOverview/Introduction\nGovernance\nStrategy\nRisk management\nMetrics and targets\nConclusion\nAppendix\n \n-58- Mizuho Financial Group \n \n \n1.
