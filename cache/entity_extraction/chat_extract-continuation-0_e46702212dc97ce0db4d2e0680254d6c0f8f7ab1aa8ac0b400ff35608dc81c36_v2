We started with our c. £162 billion listed \nequity and credit portfolio which was c.53% of  \nour total investment portfolio and is the scope  \nof our 2025 target. Since 2021, we have extended \nthe baseline to include sovereign bonds and \ncommercial real estate assets, which together \naccount for a further £47 billion (15%) of our \ninvestment portfolio. As at year-end 2022, we have \nevaluated the baseline of 100% of the investments \nin scope of the 2025 target, and c.95% of the \ninvestments covered by the 2030 target. (see  \nTable 1). Our 2030 target covers all investments \nwhere we exercise influence and control, which \nconstitutes c.81% of our portfolio. \n Our footprint calculations use the financed \nemissions methodology as developed by the \nPartnership for Carbon Accounting Financials \n(‘PCAF’) insofar as possible. PCAF is a global \npartnership of financial institutions that work \ntogether to develop and implement a harmonised \napproach to assess and disclose Greenhouse \ngasses (GHG) emissions associated with their  \nloans and investments.\nAs we expanded our carbon footprint baseline,  \nwe prioritised asset categories based on materiality \nand where measurement methodologies have \nbeen established by PCAF. The financed  \nemissions baseline is calculated using Scope 1 and 2 \nemissions of the companies we finance. A clear \nlimitation therefore is that the calculation relies \nupon good quality disclosure from our investee \ncompanies. We plan to undertake additional \ncalculation to include Scope 3 emissions of \ninvestee companies when disclosures permit  \nand the data is sufficiently robust.\nTable 1: Roadmap to expand our carbon footprint baseline (based on 2021 AUA)\n Asset class Scope of portfolio \ndecarbonisation target \n£bn1 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025+\nListed assets 2 (equity & credit) 2025 target \n2030 target\n2050 \ntarget\n162     \nCash 29     \nSovereign bonds 42     \nCommercial real estate  \n(equity and loans) \n5     \nLoans (non-real estate) 3 7     \nEquity release mortgages 4     \nAlternatives – private  \nplacement loans\n1     \nOther collective vehicles / \nExternal Fund Links 4 \n58     \nAUM covered in carbon footprint baseline £308bn £191bn £238bn £244bn £250bn £308bn \n% of Total AUM covered  62% 77% 79% 81% 100% \n% 2025 target covered 100% 100% 100% 100% 100%\n% 2030 target covered 76% 95% 98% 100% 100%\nNotes: \n1 Figures provided are based on YE21 values from Phoenix’s Report and Accounts, adjusted to reflect exposures in collective vehicles.\n2 Captures listed assets within segregated portfolios, PUTM funds and certain EFLs where look-through data is available.\n3 Captures infrastructure debt (including local authority loans and municipal bonds) and private placements.\n4 This figure has been derived as a balancing figure to enable the total AUM to equate to YE21 balance sheet value.\n1\n24\nPhoenix Group Holdings plc Net Zero Transition Plan\nInvest Engage Lead\nEmbedding net zero \nin our business\nBecoming a \nnet zero business Measuring our progress\nExecutive \nsummary\nAlongside our carbon footprint we  \nare adopting a suite of metrics that  \nwe will use to track progress towards  \nour interim targets and overall goal  \nof net zero by 2050.\nCentral to this is increasing the provision of climate \ndata and developing proprietary tools to improve \nour ability to measure and manage our exposure \nto climate risk.
