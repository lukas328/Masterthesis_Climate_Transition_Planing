Nowhere is the criticality of affordable solutions more important than in emerging markets. \nOur work last year supporting Indonesia and Vietnam’s Just Energy Transition Partnerships and Egypt’s \n \nLetter from the CEO\n\nTCFD REPORT 2022: CITI’S APPROACH TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND NET ZERO | 5\nlandmark energy transition program has resulted in more actionable playbooks that other countries can \nlearn from and follow.  \nObtaining more reliable and actionable climate data also continues to be a challenge that we are navigating \nacross our businesses, and we’ve been supportive of regulatory developments to ensure more consistent, \ncomparable and reliable climate disclosures.\nOver the past year , we have continued to build up our capacity to manage and mitigate climate risks, whilst \nalso realigning our own business around opportunities in the energy transition. That includes augmenting \nour Clean Energy Transitions banking team, expanding our Climate Risk team and establishing a Head of \nNet Zero Operations to help realize our net zero commitment for Citi’s own sites and facilities. Despite \nthe geopolitical and macroeconomic headwinds, we continue to make progress toward meeting our \ncommitment to financing and facilitating $1 trillion in sustainable finance by 2030. \nMeeting the need for energy access whilst also accelerating the transition to a low-carbon economy is no \neasy feat. But as the world’s most global bank that has an on-the-ground presence in 95 countries and does \nbusiness in nearly 160 countries, we have the unique perspective and local knowledge to support solutions \nfor the clients and communities we serve.\nI invite you to learn more about Citi’s approach and initiatives across our firm in the pages that follow. Our \nTCFD Report represents a hallmark of all our climate-related efforts — our commitment to transparency. \nThe report describes our continued efforts towards our climate goals and disclosures in line with the TCFD \nframework. We are transparent about our progress and the challenges we face on the path to net zero \nand are committed to sharing our experience so that we all can learn together and chart the course to a \nhealthier , more sustainable future.  \n.  \nJane Fraser | Chief Executive Officer, Citi\n6 | TCFD REPORT 2022: CITI’S APPROACH TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND NET ZERO\nIntroductory Statements\nCiti has over two decades of experience assessing and managing environmental- and social-related risks \nand opportunities. As these issues have continued to evolve, so has our understanding of climate-related \nrisks and opportunities. This year , we have increased the number of our loan portfolio sectors covered by \nour Net Zero Plan from two to six. With each sector that we bring into our Net Zero Plan, we leverage our \nlearnings from the other sectors, including the methodologies and metrics used and the client engagement \ntools developed. We remain committed to improving upon the progress made to date. \n \nIntroduction\n \nPART 1\nDefining Our Net Zero Plan \nOur Net Zero Transition Principles and our Net Zero Plan provide the foundation for us to implement \nour goal of achieving net zero operational emissions by 2030 and for our financing by 2050. Our \nsector-specific financed emissions reduction targets for each of the in-scope lending portfolios now \nincludes Auto Manufacturing, Commercial Real Estate, Energy, Power , Steel and Thermal Coal Mining. \nA broad governance structure oversees our Net Zero Plan, consisting of the full Board and three \nBoard committees: an ESG Council chaired by our CEO, and a newly formed Climate and Sustainability \nCouncil, which combines our prior Global Sustainability Steering Committee and our Net Zero Task \nForce. Operationalizing this Net Zero Plan will require a coordinated effort across our businesses. \nWe are providing financial support and advice for climate solutions under our $1 Trillion Sustainable \nFinance Commitment. In addition, we are working to improve our own skill base to better assess \nand support our clients. We are providing climate-related training to frontline banking teams and \nrisk managers to advance our engagement strategy to better assess our clients’ climate risk and \ntransition plans while maintaining transparent and productive communication with a variety of \nstakeholders including investors, regulators and policymakers. Our sectoral targets, exposures and \nfinanced emissions and intensity metrics will serve as benchmarks to keep us accountable and \nhighlight any needs for corrective action.
