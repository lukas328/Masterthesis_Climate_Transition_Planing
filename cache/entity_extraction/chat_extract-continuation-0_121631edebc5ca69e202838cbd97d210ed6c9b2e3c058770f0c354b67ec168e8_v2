The table below \nshows NatWest Group’s estimated (i) absolute emissions, (ii) physical and economic emissions intensities, (iii) physical emissions intensity reduction estimates for year 2030 aligned to NatWest Group’s climate ambition to halve the climate \nimpact of financing activity, including those validated by the SBTi as science-based. We will continue to work on these in 2023 and further refine our estimates as we enhance our understanding, calculation methodologies and data. As \ndetailed throughout this section, we have used a combination of methodologies (some of which are still under development) to estimate these emissions.\n2021 2019 2030\nSystem Sector\nScope 1
