These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon, were addressed \ninÂ the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\nThis is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.\nClaims, uncertainties and other provisions is a new key audit matter this year. Divestment of the Health business and Battery Materials exit, which were key audit matters last year, are no longer \nincluded because these represent transactions that have been less complex and required less audit effort from the engagement team in the current year. Otherwise, the key audit matters below \nare consistent with last year.\nKey audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter\nRefinery metal accounting (group and parent) Â \nRefer to the Significant issues considered by the Audit Committee within the Audit Committee \nReport and note 1 and 36 to the financial statements. \nAs part of its refining activities the group processes a significant amount of metal on behalf of third \nparties, whereby the group must return preâ€‘agreed recoverable quantities of refined metal to those \nparties at an agreed date. Any metal in excess of this preâ€‘agreed quantity is retained by the group. \nAs such, the group makes an estimate of how much metal it will recover as part of its refining \noperations. \nThe majority of metal processed at refineries is owned by customers and is not held on the financial \nbalance sheet of the group. As such, the group performs a metal balance sheet reconciliation \ntoÂ ensure quantities of precious metals held at yearâ€‘end are appropriately understood, classified \nasÂ either owned by Johnson Matthey or the customer and reconciled to its financial position. \nThis ensures that only the groupâ€‘owned inventory is recorded on the balance sheet and that the \nprice allocated to this owned inventory is at the lower of cost and net realisable value. \nDuring the refining process there are a series of complex estimates including: \n(i) Estimation of the level of metal contained in the carrier material entering the refining process, \nthe refined metal that leaves the refining process, and the residual metal in the refining process \nat year-end; \n(ii) Estimates of the process losses of precious metals that may be lost during the refining and \nfabrication process, and the adequacy of these provisions; \n(iii) Estimates of the metal in the refinery process as informed by refinery stocktakes, and \ntheÂ subsequent sampling and assaying to assess the precious metal content in stocktake \nsamples; and \n(iv) Estimates of the net realisable value of unhedged metal held at yearâ€‘end.\nEach of these estimates impacts different areas of the audit. The refining process and its \nassociated estimates are an area of focus for our audit due to the inherent complexity of the \naccounting and amount of metal processed are deemed a significant risk due to the inherent \ncomplexity of the accounting and amount of metal processed.\nWe evaluated the design and operation of key controls at the main refining locations over \nrefinery stocktakes and metal assaying procedures. \nWe tested that the metal balance sheet was prepared and reviewed on a monthly basis. \nWe tested the classification of precious metals at yearâ€‘end on the metal balance sheet, \ntoÂ determine if metal was owned by the group or the customer. Our procedures included \nsending confirmations to customers, and testing the balance of customer metal that was \ninÂ the refining process, but not contractually due. \nWe assessed managementâ€™s policy for recognising stocktake gains and losses arising \nfromÂ stocktakes. We attended physical stock counts at sites where these were performed \nbyÂ management. The purpose was to verify the existence of inventory and adherence \ntoÂ theÂ groupâ€™s stocktake processes, and the reasonableness of stocktake gains and losses \natÂ these sites. \nWe assessed the underlying controls that have been implemented by management, \ntoÂ monitor potential inventory gains or losses through the refining process and stocktake \nresults, to assess the likelihood and quantum of process losses (if any) of metal between the \ndate ofÂ the stocktake and the yearâ€‘end date. We assessed process loss provisions compared \ntoÂ historical metal gain revenue and refinery stocktake results. \nWe tested that all unhedged metal was being held at the lower of cost and net realisable \nvalue, on an individual metal by metal methodology, with reference to external metal \npriceÂ data. \nWe considered the adequacy of the groupâ€™s disclosures about the degree of estimation \ninvolved in arriving at the value of metal inventory. \nBased on the procedures performed, we noted no material issues arising from our work.\nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts
