Excluding South African fund platform AUM of c. £11.1 billion.\n1\nSustainability and Stewardship Report\nNinety One is an active investment manager. We invest on \nbehalf of our clients to help them achieve their long-term \ninvestment objectives. We established our business in South \nAfrica in 1991. From these emerging market origins, we have built \na global footprint. \nThe business operates with the purpose of “investing for \na better tomorrow” which guides our culture and values. \nNinety One is listed on the London and Johannesburg stock \nexchanges with a substantial employee ownership.\nAbout Ninety One\nCore asset class offerings and assets under \nmanagement (“AUM”)1\nWhat we do\nNinety One offers a range of specialist and outcomes-\noriented strategies that cover multiple asset classes and \nare managed by teams with distinct investment skill sets.\nEquities\n£58.4bn\nFixed Income\n£31.9bn\nMulti-Asset\n£20.4bn\nAlternatives\n£4.3bn\n2\nSustainability and Stewardship Report\n42% Developed markets 58% Emerging markets\nAUM by strategy type\n64% Institutional 36% Advisor\nAUM by client type\nWhere we operate\n£24.2bn\nUK AUM\n£14.6bn\nEurope AUM\n£15.4bn\nAmericas AUM\n£51.3bn\nAfrica AUM\n£20.7bn\nAsia Pacific AUM\n1,187\nstaff\n21\noffices\n15\ncountries\nOperationsClient GroupInvestments\n4\nSustainability and Stewardship Report\nFrom our Chief Executive Officer\nAchieving a sustainable future was \nnever going to be easy. For all the \nadvocates, there are also sceptics, \nideologues, the self-interested and \nthe weary. \nWe have noted, in the past year, rising resistance \nto environmental, social and governance \ninitiatives. Efforts by governments worldwide \nto curb reliance on fossil fuels, protect forests \nand expand carbon-pricing tools experienced \n“the most significant setbacks to progress in a \nsingle year”, according to the State of Climate \nAction 2023 report, published by the World \nResources Institute.\nAnd yet, the facts tell an irrefutable tale. The global \nmean temperature for the 12 months through \nJanuary 2024 became the highest for a year on \nrecord and, most strikingly, for the first time over \na year exceeded the 1.5 oC level over the pre-\nindustrial average. The ceiling has been breached.\nDespite the political distractions, it remains \ncritical to forge a timely path to net zero to \nensure the planet is able to accommodate its \npeople, creatures and ecosystems for the long \nterm. At Ninety One, we shall certainly stay \nthe course. It is the right thing to do, but also \nnecessary to preserve and grow the value of \nour clients’ assets. We approach sustainability \nthrough a fiduciary lens: managing risks and \nopportunities on behalf of our clients in pursuit \nof required returns.\nOur investment capabilities, experience and \nfocus also give us access to the vast commercial \nopportunities presented by the energy transition \nand the need for solutions to a range of \nsustainability challenges, particularly in emerging \nmarkets, whose inclusion is essential to success. \nWhile investors alone cannot deliver a sustainable \nfuture, a key contribution we can make is through \nthe mobilisation of private as well as public \nfinance at grand scale. We are fully committed to \nthis effort and will continue advocating for others \nto do so.\nThis report explains how we are handling the \nsustainability challenge and pursuing a better, \nmore sustainable planet on behalf of all our \nstakeholders. At all times, aligned with these \nobjectives, we know our primary responsibility \nis to help our clients achieve their long-term \ninvestment goals.\nForeword\nNinety One’s Chief Executive Officer, Hendrik du Toit, has \nreviewed the 2024 Sustainability and Stewardship Report \nto ensure alignment with the outcomes reported to the DLC \nSustainability, Social and Ethics Committee, as well as fair, \nbalanced and clear reporting.\nHendrik du Toit\nFounder and Chief Executive Officer \n\n5\nSustainability and Stewardship Report\nNazmeera Moola\nChief Sustainability Officer\nFrom our Chief Sustainability Officer\nA key focus of our sustainability \nefforts in the reporting period was \nto work with the investment teams \nto drive positive change at our \nportfolio companies. \nTo support the energy transition, this included \nassessing companies’ progress towards net zero \nusing our proprietary Transition Plan Assessment \n(TPA) framework, as well as via targeted \nengagements. We again focused these strategic \nengagements on the largest corporate contributors \nto our firm-wide carbon emissions. We also \nconducted strategic engagements with companies \nwith idiosyncratic social and governance issues. \nWe have strengthened our focus on the social \naspects of sustainability, enhancing our assessment \nframework for the social elements of corporate \ntransition plans, and developing a new analysis \ntoolkit to assess risks and opportunities in diversity, \nequity and inclusion (DEI). We also carried out the \ngroundwork to help our investment teams make more \ncomprehensive assessments of nature-related risks \nand impacts, which will be a focus this year. \nOver the last three years, we have vigorously \nadvocated for the finance industry to focus on \nreal-world emissions reduction,\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
