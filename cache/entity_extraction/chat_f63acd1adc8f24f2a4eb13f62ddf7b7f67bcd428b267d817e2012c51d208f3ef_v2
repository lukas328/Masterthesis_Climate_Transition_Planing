Within the net-zero ecosystem, the \nSBTi is unique in providing independent, transparent, and quantitative assessment of company and financial \ninstitution targets. The SBTi believes that the focus of FI net-zero targets “should not lie on reaching a state of \nnet-zero GHG emissions within portfolios but instead, ensuring that net-zero targets incentivize FIs to sufficiently \ncontribute to helping achieve the global goal of net-zero emissions at a planetary level.” 280  \nIn its Foundations for Science-Based Net-Zero Target Setting in the Financial Sector report, the SBTi proposed a \nset of four principles to “guide the formulation and assessment of net-zero targets.” 281\nTo drive the action needed to meet societal climate and sustainability goals, the SBTi stresses the principle of \n“completeness .” This means that FIs should ensure their net-zero targets lead to a state that is “compatible with \nreaching net-zero emissions at the global level.” 282 To achieve this, the SBTi says FIs should address all operational \nand financing activities — not just those they can directly influence. \nThe SBTi sets out its expectations that FIs should “transition and align their financing activities to net zero in \nline with pathways that achieve the Paris Agreement” 283 in its “science-based ambition ” principle. This principle \nencourages FIs to consider both the synergies and trade-offs between different pathways.\nMETRICS AND TARGETS\nCONTENTS  |  FINANCIAL INSTITUTION NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLANS — FUNDAMENTALS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND GUIDANCE\n86\nThe SBTi understands that actions FIs take to achieve portfolio reductions can have different outcomes on \nreal-world emissions, depending on how they are implemented. On this issue, the SBTi’s “ real economy impact ” \nprinciple states that FIs “should leverage their abilities to influence and engage other actors as well as focus their \nfinancing activities to help achieve economy-wide decarbonization and a just transition, and not simply reduce \nportfolio exposure to GHG emissions.” 284 \nThe SBTi emphasizes that the development of climate solutions is needed in parallel to the decarbonization \nof existing assets, with the two being complementary in supporting the economy’s transition to net zero. The \nSBTi’s “decarbonization and climate solutions ” principle outlines how FIs should consider both the financing of \ndecarbonization efforts as well as climate solutions. 285 \nIn addition to these principles, this SBTi report provides further detail on metrics and targets for different types  \nof FIs, and the opportunity to assess and validate science-based targets. \n284 Ibid., p. 29.\n285 Ibid., p. 30.\nMETRICS AND TARGETS\nCONTENTS  |  FINANCIAL INSTITUTION NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLANS — FUNDAMENTALS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND GUIDANCE\n87\nOverview and relevance: Ultimate accountability \nrests with the Chief Executive Officer and relevant \ngovernance body responsible for strategic \noversight, to set a bold, actionable plan and ensure \nthat the organization can adapt to effectively \nimplement it. Several functions within a financial \ninstitution are typically involved in the design and \nexecution of a net-zero transition plan. Establishing \neffective governance processes and structures, \nwith clear roles, responsibilities, and remuneration, \nis critical to the success of the plan’s design \nand execution. Remuneration and incentives for \nindividuals should be in line with key performance \nindicators related to the net-zero transition plan \nand relevant to the individual’s role. \nTHEME\nGovernance\nGovernance structures are key mechanisms for enabling financial institutions to oversee progress \ntoward net-zero targets. The outcome of a net-zero transition plan will flow directly from governance \nand leadership tone. Identifying senior personnel for specific oversight and implementation roles and \nresponsibilities, and linking remuneration, where structure allows, to achieving progress, will ensure \nappropriate resources are deployed. \nSenior personnel will be responsible for ensuring that all teams across their organization have the required \nclimate transition-related skills, resources, and understanding to deliver the desired results. Leaders can \nsupport a culture of innovation and maximum employee engagement to find creative solutions to meeting \nthe net-zero objectives. Transparent communication about the transition plan and ongoing progress keeps \ninternal stakeholders up-to-date and adds another layer of accountability.\nClimate-related governance should be integrated at the highest levels of a financial institution and should \nflow down to every part of the organization through training, education, and engagement.\nRecommendation\nDefine roles for the Board or strategy oversight \nbody and senior management ensuring they \nhave ownership, oversight, and responsibility \nfor the net-zero targets. Assign appropriate \nindividuals and teams to all aspects of both \ndesign and delivery of the transition plan. Use \nremuneration incentives for all roles, where \npossible. Review the transition plan regularly \nto ensure material updates/developments \nare incorporated; challenges are reviewed \nas an opportunity to correct course; and \nimplementation risks are properly  managed.\n1) COMPONENT: ROLES, RESPONSIBILITIES, AND REMUNERATION \nCONTENTS  |  FINANCIAL INSTITUTION NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLANS — FUNDAMENTALS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND GUIDANCE\n88\nGuidance: Financial institutions should establish \na clear mandate, role, and authority for the\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
