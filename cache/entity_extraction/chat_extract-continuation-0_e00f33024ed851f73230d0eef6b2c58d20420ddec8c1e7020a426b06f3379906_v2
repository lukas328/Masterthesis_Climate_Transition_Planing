LSEG CEO David \nSchwimmer is a member of the GFANZ CEO \nPrincipals Group.\nNet Zero Service Providers Alliance\nLaunched in 2021, under the GFANZ umbrella, \nthe Net Zero Financial Service Providers Alliance \n(NZFSPA) is a global group of Service Providers \ncommitted to supporting the goal of global net \nzero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 or \nsooner, in line with the ambition to limit the  \nglobal temperature increase to 1.5°C above  \npre-industrial levels. \nThis alliance commits members to align relevant \nservices and products to net zero by 2050.

Our research teams provide in-depth \nunderstanding of the carbon markets, policy and \nregulatory drivers and forecasts for emissions \ntrading to help organisations achieve their \nemissions targets.\nClimate Transition Centre\nAnnounced in October 2021, the LSEG \nFoundation supported the funding of the \nTransition Pathway Initiative (TPI) Global  \nClimate Transition Centre at the London School  \nof Economics. \nIt will dramatically scale publicly available \nresearch on the climate transition pathways \nof 10,000 businesses, covering global equity \nmarkets, fixed income and private markets. \nThis builds on our existing relationship through \nFTSE Russell, our Index business, which is TPI’s \ndata partner.\nLSEG CLIMATE TRANSITION PLAN 202232\nCONTENTS\n2030 and beyond\nAs this is our first Climate Transition Plan, we have \nfocused on the actions we are taking to achieve our \nnear-term targets to 2030.\nMany of these actions are underway and delivering results. We look  \nforward to providing details of progress in future reports.\nDuring 2022 we are undertaking further work to assess the actions \nand investment required beyond 2030 to achieve our longer-term net \nzero target. Using the SBTi’s Net Zero Guidance released in October \n2021, our work in 2022 will identify our path to net zero from 2030 \nacross our business operations and value chain with the adoption of \nmeasurable targets and interim KPIs.\nTo help achieve this, we will invest in nature-based solutions and other \ncarbon-reduction technologies to remove from the atmosphere or \noffset more carbon
