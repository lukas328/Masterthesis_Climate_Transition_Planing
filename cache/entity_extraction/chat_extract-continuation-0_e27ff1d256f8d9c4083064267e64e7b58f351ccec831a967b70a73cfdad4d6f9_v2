Another example of transition skills and training could be technical competency around scenario analysis and \nscience-based transition  pathways.\nof the net-zero transition plan from the Board, \nstrategy oversight bodies, and senior management \nto day-to-day plan execution by employees. \nFinancial institutions should consider providing \nongoing and relevant training at every level of the \norganization, including the highest strategic levels, \nand transparent processes should be in place to \nassess and improve skills and knowledge gaps. \nOrganizations may also want to consider making \nskills and training accessible to key vendors and \nvalue chain partners. 301 \nAll levels of the institution should have access to \nexternal climate experts and resources for deep \ntechnical knowledge as appropriate and as internal \nteams start to build their climate skills. Teams may \nneed to be kept abreast of new developments in \nscience and industry and such resources should be \nrefreshed, as needed.  \nAn ambitious net-zero transition plan requires an \norganization-wide reorientation and culture change. \nAs part of a change program, the institution \nshould consider building broader awareness and \nunderstanding of the transition plan, so employees \nthroughout the organization understand how and \nwhy the institution is adapting its business; what \nis expected of them; and how they can contribute. \nEmployees could be engaged and educated on the \ntransition plan through initiatives like employee \nengagement surveys, and integrated learning \nplans. Employee skill sets could be assessed in \nperformance evaluations and interviews. Awareness \nand understanding will facilitate integration of the \ntransition objectives into decision-making across \nthe organization and help create employee buy-in \nat all levels.\nRecommendation\nProvide training and development support \nto the teams and individuals designing, \nimplementing, and overseeing the plan so \nthat they have sufficient skills and knowledge \nto perform their roles (including at the Board \nand senior management level).
