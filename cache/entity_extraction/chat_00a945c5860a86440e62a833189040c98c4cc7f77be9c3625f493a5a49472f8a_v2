This role works closely with the Citi Location and Realty Services team, which \nis responsible for monitoring and reporting on operational footprint goals. Also, in 2022 we realigned \nour Climate Risk team to be housed within our Enterprise Risk Management function to further embed \nclimate within our risk management policies and practices. We continued to grow our Climate Risk team \nto increase the capabilities and climate-related expertise of this important management body. We also are \ncombining our former Global Sustainability Steering Committee and Net Zero Task Force into the Climate \nand Sustainability Council to further operationalize our net zero and sustainability goals and facilitate cross \nfunctional collaboration across Citi’s businesses. \nIn 2022, the ESG Council, which consists of senior members of management and certain subject matter \nexperts who provide review and guidance of our ESG activities and goals, met on a near monthly basis \nto discuss sustainable finance progress, climate data governance and progress towards our net zero \noperations commitment. The ESG Council additionally reviewed our net zero financing progress, which \nincluded discussions of targets for new sectors and for the Energy and Power sectors.\nGiven Citi’s global presence and the growing international shift from voluntary reporting to mandated \nclimate-related disclosures, our climate governance has grown to further involve global functions including \nLegal, Internal Audit, Finance and Compliance. These global functions work with our management and \nspecialized groups to assist in the development of our climate-related disclosures and prepare for emerging \nregulation applicable to our global entities. \nAdditional details regarding the management structure of our climate governance including our corporate, \nrisk management, business units and operations and technology groups are described in greater detail in \npages 12-14 of our 2021 TCFD Report.\nTCFD REPORT 2022: CITI’S APPROACH TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND NET ZERO | 15\nSkills, Culture & Expertise\nWe understand that achieving our climate goals and implementing our Net Zero Plan requires the \nmembers of our governance teams to further develop climate-related expertise and capabilities. At Citi, \nwe believe that the Board should be composed of individuals who are skilled in more than one area, \nwith the ability to advise on a wide array of potential risks, and thereby contribute more broadly to the \noversight of the firm. We therefore continue to educate our entire Board, as well as senior management, \nto build out climate-related expertise and capabilities. For example, as discussed earlier , since 2021, \nthe Board has received four reports regarding our Net Zero Plan and a deep-dive net zero tutorial \nfrom seniors.  Our senior management also continued to expand their climate expertise and capability \nto evaluate and manage climate risk and implement our Net Zero Plan through internal deep-dive \npresentations designed for specific banking teams and participating in internal and external webinars \nand roundtables. \nRealizing our climate goals and implementing our Net Zero Plan also requires a skilled workforce with \nclimate expertise. Citi is continuing to evaluate and develop employee training pilots on climate change. \nWe have continued to offer our enterprise-wide training module on climate risk and have launched \ntargeted foundational training for frontline banking teams. For more information, please see the Climate \nTraining section. \nRemuneration\nSustainability and climate-related goals are incorporated into several executive scorecards, which are \nkey elements of performance management tied to the determination of incentive compensation for \nthese executives. \nScorecards for members of the Executive Management team and senior management include progress \non our Net Zero Plan and target setting, our $1 Trillion Sustainable Finance Commitment and climate risk \nmanagement. Certain positions have specific scorecard elements, for example: \n • CEO - Driving the delivery of environmental and social finance under our $1 Trillion Sustainable \nFinance Goal; and \n • CEO of ICG, Chief Risk Officer , Global Head of Enterprise Services and Public Affairs, and Global \nCo-Heads of BCMA - Supporting the development and operationalization of Citi’s Net Zero Plan and \napplicable 2030 targets, and driving the delivery of environmental and social finance under the $1 \nTrillion Sustainable Finance Goal.\nFor further detail on our $1 Trillion Sustainable Finance Goal, please see the “Metrics & Targets” section of \nthis report. \nMoreover , climate change strategy and risk management performance goals are incorporated into annual \ngoals and performance review processes for a number of our senior executives and their teams that are \n16 | TCFD REPORT 2022: CITI’S APPROACH TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND NET ZERO\nresponsible for developing and implementing our approach to climate change. These executives include \nthe CSO, Head of Environmental and Social Risk Management (ESRM), Global Head of Climate Risk, Head \nof Net Zero Operations and the Global Head of Building Operations, whose team is responsible for our \nenvironmental footprint goals.\nTCFD REPORT 2022: CITI’S APPROACH TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND NET ZERO | 17\nThis period of low-carbon transition presents new challenges and unique opportunities which we are \nembracing across the firm. As clients around the globe seek to both develop and take advantage of these \nopportunities, we want to be there to support their transition. To this end, we have re-organized key \nbusiness teams to provide cross-sector expertise and financing. We are also focused on managing the risks \nthat climate change presents to our firm through updated climate risk management processes as well as \nthrough our Net Zero Plan. \nNet Zero Commitment\nIn 2021, Citi announced our commitment to achieving net zero GHG emissions by 2050.
