Initially launched in 2021 through \nRetail Banking, our Commercial & Institutional business began to roll out rPVC replacement debit cards from \nFebruary 2022, with Commercial & Institutional credit cards from November 2022. \nAs at 31 December 2022, over 15.8 million replacement rPVC cards \nhad been issued to our retail and corporate customers, representing \n95.4% of all cards issued by NatWest Group.\nIn Q2 2022 we launched our new sustainable colleague uniforms across our branch network, featuring garments made from \nrecycled materials. We also replaced our plastic name badges with a more sustainable option made from bamboo. \nIn 2022, we issued more than 142,000 uniform garments using \nrecycled materials and issued nearly 19,000 bamboo name badges, \nwith each badge saving 5g of plastic. \nWe teamed up with Reborn to deliver our first Reverse Vending Machines in 2022. The machines are capable of recycling \nplastic cards (payment and non-payment), offering a secure way for consumers to begin recycling the estimated 65 million \nunused plastic cards still in circulation, as well as card readers and plastic bottles. Following a successful trial with two \nmachines at our London and Edinburgh offices, four additional machines were installed for public use in early 2023, located \nnear London’s busiest transport hubs and largest hospitals.\nOur 2022 pilot recycled more than 28,000 cards received via return \nmail, with material re-purposed into more than 3,000 hats and pairs of \nsocks. More than 400 of these garments were donated to our charity \npartner Social Bite in December, to support homeless and vulnerable \ncommunities.\nColleague support \ntowards EV adoption\nIn February 2022 NatWest launched a tool to support colleagues in making an informed decision around their ability to switch \nto an electric vehicle. The EV8 Switch app uses real driving information to provide colleagues with insights around their \nsuitability to switch to an EV, along with details of potential CO2 and cost savings of doing so.\nAs at 31 December 2022, 1,149 colleagues. had created EV8 \nSwitch accounts. \nBespoke training for \nCapital Markets\nIn November 2022, NatWest Markets colleagues received training on greenwashing risk, covering recent UK regulatory \ndevelopments, and provided an overview of mis-selling, litigation risk, reputational risk, impacts and mitigants. \nTraining was delivered to over 850 NatWest Markets colleagues via \na webinar.\n(1) Votes cast with regard to such resolution (whether for or against) as a percentage of NatWest Group’s total voting rights was 85.96%.\nWe have made significant progress in turning our climate ambition into action since setting out our climate strategy \nin 2020. As we support our customer transition we are also working towards getting our own house in order, \nwhether reducing our direct own operational emissions and broader activity, equipping colleagues with the skills \nand knowledge needed to help address the climate challenge or reflecting our purpose in how we influence change \nand promote a more sustainable real economy. From broad strategic initiatives to highly focused, practical solutions \ndesigned to support a more circular economy, we continue to review and challenge the way we work.\nFor further detail on our target to reduce emissions from our direct own operations by 50% by 2025, against a \n2019 baseline, refer to section 5.4.\n26NatWest Group plc | 2022 Climate-related Disclosures Report\nGovernance Strategy and Climate transition plan Risk Management and Scenario Analysis Metrics and TargetsIntroduction\nFinanced emissions Assets under Management Our Own Operations\nSectoral decarbonisation targets:  \nLending\nTemperature alignment target:  \nLending and investment\nPortfolio alignment and carbon intensity \ntargets\nOwn operational value chain\nScience-based SBTi validated sectoral decarbonisation \ntargets cover:\n • Electricity generation, residential mortgages, \ncommercial real estate, land transport, automotive \nmanufacturing, cement, aluminium and iron \nand steel.\n • These sectors comprised 59% of the lending book at \n31 December 2019. \n • See section 5.5 for SBTi targets for in scope sectors.\nScience-based SBTi validated temperature rating \ntargets covers:\n • Oil and gas (Scope 1, 2 and 3), and other sectors \nincluding aviation, shipping and agriculture.\n • These sectors comprised 20% of the lending book at \n31 December 2019.
