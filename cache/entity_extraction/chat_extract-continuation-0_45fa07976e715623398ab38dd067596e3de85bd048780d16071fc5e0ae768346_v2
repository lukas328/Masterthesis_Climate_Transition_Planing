These buildings \ninclude the Group’s headquarters in Spain, \nMexico, Argentina and T urkey. Three of them \nhave also received the highest certification, \nLEED Platinum. We also hold 7 WWF Green \nOffice labels in T urkey and 20 Edge badges \nin Peru. These certifications promote the \nreduction of our environmental footprint and \ncarbon emissions.\nWith respect to management certifications, \nBBVA has implemented an Environmental \nManagement System in many of its \nbuildings, based on the ISO 14.001:2015 \nstandard, which is certified every year by \nan independent entity. This certification is \nused to control and evaluate environmental \nperformance in the operations of some of \nits buildings. This system is implemented \nin 86 buildings and 1,022 branches in the \nmain countries where the Group operates. \nIn 2022, BBVA Mexico expanded its area \ncertified under this management system \nto four new buildings (42,260 sq m). \nFinally, three of the buildings in Spain, \nthe BBVA Argentina headquarters and \nten branches in that country also have an \nEnergy Management System certified by an \nindependent third party that meets the ISO \n50.001:2018 standard.\nP.  98\nBBVA Report on TCFD 2022\nThis English version is a translation of the original in Spanish for information purposes only.
