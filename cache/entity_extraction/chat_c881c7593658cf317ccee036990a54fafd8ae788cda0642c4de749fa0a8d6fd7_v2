As of March, with the formation of a new Board \nof Directors, we began a detailed and careful analysis \nof our business. Although the year’s financial results do \nnot demonstrate BRF’s maximum potential, we man-\naged to move forward with the foundations that will \nfirmly pave the way for a new chapter in the Company’s \nhistory. But this would not be possible without the ded-\nication of the almost 100,000 people who work with us \nevery day. With enormous discipline in the execution, \nagility, simplicity and efficiency of their work, we are \ncertain that we will resume our efficiency and profitabil-\nity.\nOne of the first steps on this new journey has been to \ndirect all of our internal efforts towards BRF’s core busi-\nness through a strong efficiency plan. We have taken \nnumerous measures, throughout the value chain, aim-\ning to optimize the allocation of capital in a careful and \norderly manner . Between September and December , by \nimproving our operational indicators, reducing costs \nrelating to inactivity, and simplifying our innovation \nportfolio, we captured R$ 210 million, with our non-ne-\ngotiable commitment to Safety, Quality and Integrity \nalways guiding the way. \nAt the close of 2022 , the Company’s net revenue \nachieved R$ 53.8 billion, an increase of 11.3% com-\npared to the previous year , with results arising from our \nwork designed to grow in products with added value \nand expand our presence in international markets. To \nincrease our results in Brazil, we have simplified our \nportfolio, improved our commercial execution, and \nincreased the presence of our brands at points of sale, \nwhich continues to be one of our main strengths. In the \nHalal market Sadia and Banvit, already leaders in their \nmarkets, grew even more in terms of market share and \nitems of added value. \nWe have strengthened our export platform, with new \nplant approvals for countries including Canada, Mexico, \nJapan and South Africa, reflecting the confidence that \nthe authorities in these countries have in the safety and \nreliability of our production chain. In the international \nmarket, we inaugurated a new plant in Saudi Arabia, \nthus expanding our local production.  \nOn the EESG agenda, we consolidated important \nadvances in sustainability and in the improvement of \nour governance standards.
