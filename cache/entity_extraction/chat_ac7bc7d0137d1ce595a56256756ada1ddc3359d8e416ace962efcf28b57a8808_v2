The CAO reports \nto the Audit Committee, which has responsibility \nfor approving their appointment (and removal), \nand secondarily reports to the Group CEO on \nday-to-day operations. \nAn Internal Audit Charter is in place which sets out \nthe Function’s role, authority and independence. GIA \noperates in accordance with the Global Institute of \nInternal Auditors’ international standards and the \nUK Chartered Institute of Internal Auditors Financial \nServices Code (FS Code). The Internal Audit Charter, \nwhich is reviewed annually, was approved by the \nAudit Committee in September 2022 and is available \nhere on bupa.com. \nGIA undertakes risk-based assurance work in \naccordance with an assurance plan approved and \nmonitored by the Audit Committee. GIA’s assurance \nplan is aligned with the planned work of the Group Risk \nFunction to enable collaboration and coordination and \nimprove coverage and efficiency of assurance activities \nwhere appropriate. \nIn 2022, global cross-geographic and functional \npractice groups continued to operate to coordinate and \nsupport the implementation of assurance work and to \nshare information about audit outcomes, insights and \nactions. Global audits were carried out in relation to risk \nmanagement of third parties with access to Bupa data, \nclinical governance, and payment compliance industry \ndata security standards. A number of key risk themes \nwere also reviewed across each audit including the \nextent to which: \n▪ The three lines and risk culture are embedded and \ncontributing towards an effective system of risk \nmanagement and internal control. \n▪ Data is used to drive decisions and handled \nappropriately. \n▪ Employee responsibilities are clear and understood, \nand key people risks are appropriately recognised \nand addressed. \n▪ ‘Change activity’ is governed, managed and executed \neffectively, enabling Bupa to achieve its strategic \nintentions. \n▪ Information security risks are adequately controlled. \nThe CAO regularly reports to the Audit Committee on \nGIA’s activities as well as management’s progress in \naddressing findings from its assurance work, and all \nGIA reports are made available to Audit Committee \nmembers. The CAO regularly attends Risk Committee \nmeetings, and other executive committee fora, \nincluding the CEC, to ensure that GIA’s work is \nadequately informed, supported and communicated. \nGIA maintains a quality assurance and improvement \nprogramme which includes continuous external quality \nassurance activity undertaken by a third party; internal \nquality control monitoring; and annual self-evaluation \nagainst the UK Internal Audit Code of Practice and FS \nCode. Quality assurance and improvement feedback \nis also gathered via stakeholder and employee \nengagement surveys. \nDuring 2022 an external quality assessment of GIA \nwas undertaken by an external assessor and its findings \nwere discussed at a meeting of the Audit Committee in \nJanuary 2023. See the Audit Committee report on page \n67 for more information. \nGIA’s assurance plan for 2023 is aligned with Bupa’s \nstrategy and areas of key risk arising from the nature \nand breadth of Bupa’s businesses within the context \nof the current macroeconomic environment. Key \nareas of focus of the 2023 assurance plan include: \nkey components of the Group’s strategic framework \nand transformation plans, information technology \nand data, risk management and control (including \nimplementation of the IMS), workforce management, \nlegal and regulatory compliance, clinical governance, \nand sustainability.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
