Thus, the \ndecarbonization of the cement industry will require the development \nand deployment of technology that is not currently available. Appropriate \ninvestment over the next decade will be critical to achieve the foreseen \ndecarbonization goals. \nKey strategies to cut carbon emissions in cement production include \nimproving energy efficiency, switching to lower-carbon fuels, promoting \nmaterial efficiency (to reduce the clinker-to-cement ratio and total demand), \nand low carbon innovation (e.g. CCS). BBVA’s strategy will be actively driven \nby accompanying and financing customers with transition plans16 which \ncurrently represent 82% of the total commitment in this industry. \nIt is important to note that progress towards these targets is expected to \nbe non-linear in the short term. \n16. Customers are considered to be advanced in their transition when they show a solid position according to internal \ntools such as the T ransition Risk indicator (TRi), including the definition of medium-term emission reduction targets, the \nidentification of reduction levers for the emissions management and the commitment of capital investments to execute its \ntransition plan and/or other internal evaluations based on the intensity of the customer’s emissions compared to its peers.\nP.  79\nBBVA Report on TCFD 2022\nThis English version is a translation of the original in Spanish for information purposes only.

In the terms of BBVA’s Environmental and Social Framework published \nin its corporate website.\nBBVA will however continue to finance \nsustainable projects for these coal clients, in \nthe terms of the Environmental and Social \nFramework, in support of their sustainability \ntransition.\nBBVA’s exposure to thermal coal in 2022 \namounted to €1.7bn defined as the total \ncommitment weighted by the groups’ \nrevenues from thermal coal mining or by \nthe coal fired power generation installed \ncapacity. Approximately €1bn of this \namount18 is to customers which have an \nexpectation to transition in time to meet \nBBVA’s coal phase-out goal. \nBBVA will work with the customers which do \nnot have a transition expectation in order to \nassess and proactively manage its exposure \nto such clients. Furthermore, BBVA will not \nonboard any new clients nor provide any \nfinancial services to new coal clients subject \nto the Environmental and Social Framework \nwith more than 25% of thermal coal group \nrevenue or more than 25% generation \ncapacity from thermal coal-fired power \ngeneration.\n18.
