The UK CCC 2022 Progress Report has also provided an overall score of policies targeted at financing activities that can \nsequester carbon as sinks by planting of hedgerows, trees, soil sequestration and restoring peatlands as being at “significant risk”.\nNoted below are the key policies, including related abatement potential and UK CCC’s assessment in 2022: \n • Productivity and low-carbon farming policies expected to achieve 38% of the 2035 \nabatement needed are at “significant risk” of delivery due to limited roll out under the \nSustainable Farming Incentive for specific farming activities. As per the UK CCC 2022 \nProgress Report, “timescales and incentives remain short-term, with scheme details \nincomplete. There is a reliance on farmers to voluntarily take up low-carbon farming \nmeasures, as well as a high dependency on future technology and innovation”.\n • Restoration of peatlands expected to deliver 30% of the 2035 abatement is scored as \n“significant risk” by the UK CCC as the funding for peatland restoration pledged via \nthe Nature for Climate fund in the devolved nations is typically short-term and risks not \nmeeting ambition. Similarly, the Local Nature Recovery Fund under Environmental Land \nManagement System (ELMS) England, which is expected to deliver peatland restoration \nfrom 2025 onwards, is lacking detail.\n • Agroforestry and hedges meant to deliver 11% of 2035 abatement are rated as \n“significant risk” of delivery. Fiscal incentives in 2022 were primarily delivered in the \nCountryside Stewardship Scheme in England, with Sustainable Farming Incentive \nstandards forecast to be launched for hedgerows and agroforestry in England in 2023 \nand 2024, respectively. Scotland’s Climate Change Plan update does address \nagroforestry and hedgerows, however, detail is limited.\n • Afforestation policies, meant to deliver 9% of 2035 abatement, are scored as having \n“significant risk” as current planting rates are not on track to meet the UK-wide \nannual targets of 30,000 hectare per annum by 2023, particularly for woodland \ncreation in Scotland. This is partly due to non-financial barriers: such as tenant farmers \nbeing unable to plant on land due to contractual issues, availability of skilled labour, and \nmeasurement definitions to track progress (e.g. how tree canopy is defined).\n • Biomass policy is considered to have “insufficient plans” for delivering 12% of the \n2035 abatement due to insufficient plans from the Biomass Policy Statement that was \npublished in 2021.\n • Behaviour changes to food demand and consumption is considered to have \n“insufficient plans” as the UK Government Food Strategy does not set out clear \ntargets for the food system’s impact on health, nature and climate. The UK CCC BNZ \nscenario assumes a 20% diet shift away from all meat and dairy products by 2030, \nwhich is substituted by plant-based proteins.\nClimate transition plan: Food system continued\n43NatWest Group plc | 2022 Climate-related Disclosures Report\nGovernance Strategy and Climate transition plan Risk Management and Scenario Analysis Metrics and TargetsIntroduction\nSupporting sustainable agriculture\nWe’re proud to be playing a leading role in the UK’s \ntransition to net zero. Our target to provide \n£100 billion of climate and sustainable funding and \nfinancing between 1 July 2021 and the end of 2025 \nwill enable our customers to implement green \nsolutions and help businesses become more energy \nefficient, sustainable and resilient.\nAs part of the initial iteration of our Climate transition \nplan, we are prioritising sectors with high emissions. \nWith agriculture representing 1.1% of NatWest Group’s \ngross lending as at year end 2022 and a high rate of \nemissions (see section 5.5), we’re committed to \nhelping our farming customers reduce their collective \ncarbon footprint.\nOur relationship managers and frontline teams are \nworking closely with our agriculture customers to \nunderstand the challenges they face, supporting them \nto adopt new technologies and sustainable farming \npractices to build their resilience in the face of a \nchanging climate and unprecedented increases in \noperating costs.\nIn 2022, we supported agriculture company Newhay \nFeeds Ltd to apply for Green Asset Finance, a new \nproduct that offers financing with no arrangement fee \nfor projects investing in eligible clean buildings, energy, \ntransport and agriculture. Green Asset Finance(1), \nalong with our Green Loan proposition also launched \nin February 2022, contribute to our climate and \nsustainable funding and financing target.\nBased in Yorkshire, Newhay grows, harvests, dries \nand packages hay for pet food. With Green Asset \nFinance, the company invested in a new, state-of-the-\nart hay dryer. The equipment enables Newhay to use \nlabour and machinery more effectively. Crucially, \nduring the harvest period, daily output has now risen \nfrom 30 tonnes to 50 tonnes for half the fuel costs, \nresulting in lower carbon emissions for the business.\nWe have been helping the agriculture sector thrive  \nfor more than 200 years. Through our climate and \nsustainable funding and financing, we are continuing \nto support our customers’ transition to a net-zero, \nclimate-resilient and sustainable economy.\nOur relationship managers \nand frontline teams are \nworking closely with our \nagriculture customers  \nto understand the \nchallenges they face.\nReducing costs and emissions while unlocking growth\nClimate transition plan: Case study\n(1) Green Asset Finance is available to UK businesses with an annual \nturnover of less than £25million\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
