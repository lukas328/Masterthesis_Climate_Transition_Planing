Indeed, this improvement is strengthened \nby means of internal and external audits, with the inter-\nnal ones evaluating the adherence of the internal proce-\ndures to legal requirements and client and certification \nstandards (undertaken annually by the Corporate Quality \nAssurance Department), whilst the external ones consider \nthe internationally recognized GFSI standards.\nBRF’s units hold a number of quality certificates includ-\ning BRC, IFS, Global-GAP , AloFree, Certified Humane and \nISO17025, amongst other considered as being distinc-\ntions in the market. In addition to this, BRF is audited \nexternally by different markets and clients, as well as the \nrelevant Brazilian organs, such as the Ministry of Agri-\nculture, Livestock and Supply (MAPA) and the National \nSanitary Surveillance Agency (ANVISA).\nExchange and political-economic risks\nAffected capital: Financial capital\nWhat is the risk?  \nThe geopolitical challenges and uncertainties arising due \nto the military conflict taking place between Russia and \nUkraine could have an adverse material effect on the glob-\nal economy, logistics, and the prices of certain materials \nand commodities as well as our businesses. Over recent \nyears, the macroeconomic scenario has been extremely \nchallenging, with field variation, increasing inflation and \nthe high interest rate. The year 2022 closed with the basic \ninterest rate (Selic) at 13.75%, the highest it has been \nsince January 2017. This scenario of high interest rates \nand the Brazilian Real still being highly devalued (with the \ndollar closing the year worth around R$ 5.3, against R$ 5.4 \nat the end of 2021) presents risks that could negatively \naffect our competitive standing and generation of reve-\nnue, since the prices of many of the commodities that are \nessential for maintaining production are tied to the dollar .\nHow do we manage this?  \nWe continually monitor all the contexts of the markets in \nwhich we operate through consultants, local monitoring, \nassociations and other mechanisms. We administrate part \nof our exchange rate risk through foreign currency deriv-\natives instruments and future cash flows of exports in US \ndollars and other foreign currencies.\nWhat opportunities exist?  \nThe opportunities involve a reinforcement of the business \nintelligence instruments and the diversification of our \nglobal activities in order to minimize our exposure to spe-\ncific markets and risks.\nCommodities and the cyclical nature of the business \n GRI 3-3: Material Topic (Management, transparency and traceability of \nthe supply chain)\nAffected capitals:  \nFinancial capital and Natural capital\nWhat is the risk?  \nOur operational results are subject to the cycles and volatil-\nity that affect the prices of commodities, poultry and pork, \nwhich can have an adverse effect on our whole business.\nHow do we manage this?  \nBoth in Brazil and abroad the industry is characterized by \ncyclical periods of higher prices and greater profitability, \nas well as lower prices and less profitability. Within this \ncontext, we study the sector movements and volatility of \ncommodities in depth by closely monitoring grain stocks \nand the climate in the productive regions. By doing so, it \nis possible to direct our purchasing decisions, as well as \nforecast the prices on the commodities market.\nWhat opportunities exist?  \nWe have opportunities to make gains in both efficiency and \ncompetitive standing through a strategy focused on an \nappreciation of the aspects of interdependence between \nthe parts and the whole – as well as careful planning of the \nproduction, and meeting the demands of different global \nmarkets.\n2022 Integrated  \nReport\nOur way of  \ndoing business\nOur strategy\nCulture and \nEngagement\nValue Generation\nIndicators  \nand annex\n3\n4\n5\n6\n2\nPresentation1\n30\nClimate risk  \nTCFD-2-a , TCFD-2.b, TCFD-2.c, SASB-FB-MP-440a.3, GRI 3-3: Material \nTopic (climate change, water and energy), 201-2\nAffected capitals:  \nFinancial capital and Natural capital\nWhat is the risk?  \nWe consider the potential effects of climate change in our \noperations and in the supply chain and we recognize the \nvulnerabilities associated with the natural resources and \nagricultural products that are essential to our activities. \nThe principal risks tied into this matter relate to shifts in \nthe temperature and rain patterns, including droughts \nand natural disasters, that could affect agricultural pro-\nductivity, animal welfare and the availability of water and \nenergy. These factors can adversely affect our costs and \noperational results, including causing a rise in the price \nof agricultural commodities. When this happens, there is \nan impact on the costs involved in guaranteeing animal \nwelfare and production. Also as a result of climate change \nwe can be impacted in relation to those of our environ-\nmental/EESG programs or certifications connected to the \nreduction of exposure to climate change. Other important \nfactors associated with the climate include our depen-\ndence on electricity in the operations (exposure, there-\nfore, to the fluctuations in energy costs, blackout prob-\nlems or supply crises); as well as regulatory alterations, \nsuch as the pricing or taxation of carbon, and changes \nin the legislation governing the emission of greenhouse \ngases in Brazil and the other markets where we operate. \nHow do we manage this?  \nWe have assumed public commitments to enhance our \ncontribution to the combating of climate change.
