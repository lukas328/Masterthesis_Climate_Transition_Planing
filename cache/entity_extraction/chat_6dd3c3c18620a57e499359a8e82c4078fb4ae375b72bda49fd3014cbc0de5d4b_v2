Report | Governance | Financial Statements \nIndependent auditors’ report to the members of \nThe British United Provident Association Limited \nReport on the audit of the \nfinancial statements \nOpinion \nIn our opinion, The British United Provident Association \nLimited’s Group financial statements and Company \nfinancial statements (the “financial statements”): \n▪ give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s \nand of the Company’s affairs as at 31 December \n2022 and of the Group’s loss and the Group’s and \nCompany’s cash flows for the year then ended; \n▪ have been properly prepared in accordance with \nUK-adopted international accounting standards as \napplied in accordance with the provisions of the \nCompanies Act 2006; and \n▪ have been prepared in accordance with the \nrequirements of the Companies Act 2006. \nWe have audited the financial statements, included \nwithin the Annual Report, which comprise: the \nConsolidated and Company Statements of Financial \nPosition as at 31 December 2022; the Consolidated \nIncome Statement and Consolidated Statement of \nComprehensive Income; the Consolidated and Company \nStatements of Cash Flows; the Consolidated and \nCompany Statements of Changes in Equity for the year \nthen ended; and the notes to the financial statements, \nwhich include a description of the significant \naccounting policies. \nOur opinion is consistent with our reporting to the \nAudit Committee. \nBasis for opinion \nWe conducted our audit in accordance with \nInternational Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) \nand applicable law. Our responsibilities under ISAs (UK) \nare further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities \nfor the audit of the financial statements section of our \nreport. We believe that the audit evidence we have \nobtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a \nbasis for our opinion. \nIndependence \nWe remained independent of the Group in accordance \nwith the ethical requirements that are relevant to our \naudit of the financial statements in the UK, which \nincludes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, as applicable to \npublic interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other \nethical responsibilities in accordance with these \nrequirements. \nTo the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare \nthat non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical \nStandard were not provided. \nOther than those disclosed in Note 2.3.3, we have \nprovided no non-audit services to the Company or \nits controlled undertakings in the period under audit. \nOur audit approach \nContext \nBupa is an international healthcare group, providing \nhealth insurance, health provision and aged care \nservices. The Group operates from a significant number \nof locations globally and has four reportable segments: \nBupa Asia Pacific; Europe and Latin America; Bupa \nGlobal and UK; and Other businesses, which includes \ninvestments in associates. In planning for our audit, \nwe met with the Audit Committee and members of \nmanagement across the Group to discuss and \nunderstand the businesses and any significant changes \nduring the year, and to understand their perspectives \non associated business risks. We used this insight, in \naddition to our understanding of the previous year's \naudit, when forming our own views regarding the audit \nrisks and as part of developing our planned audit \napproach to address those risks. Given the activities \nof the Group, we have teams with the relevant industry \nexperience in all significant locations in which the \nGroup operates. The COVID-19 pandemic has continued \nto have an impact on some of Bupa’s global operations \nthroughout 2022. In planning our audit, we have \nconsidered the impact of the pandemic on the Group’s \nbusiness and the financial statements. Where necessary, \nwe have utilised virtual technologies and collaborative \nworkflow tools to obtain sufficient, appropriate audit \nevidence whilst working in this hybrid environment. \nAs the restrictions on travel have eased, we have \nmet with a number of our component teams and \nlocal management in person to fulfil our ISA 600 \n(UK) responsibilities. We have also considered the \nsustainability commitments made by the directors \nand considered the potential impact of climate change \nrelated factors in our audit, including challenging \nmanagement on their assessment of how climate \nchange related risks and opportunities impact the \nfinancial statements. \nOverview \nAudit scope \n▪ The Group has four reportable segments, in addition \nto the Group Centre activities. Each reportable \nsegment includes a number of reporting components \nacross different locations and service lines. \n▪ We conducted audit testing over 37 components. \nThese were selected based on our assessment of \ninherent risk and their financial significance to the \nconsolidated financial results. \n▪ 22 components were subject to an audit of their \ncomplete financial information. \n▪ Specific audit procedures were performed on certain \nbalances and transactions for a further 15 \ncomponents. \n▪ Our audit scope provided coverage of 94% of IFRS \nLoss before taxation expense. \nBupa Annual Report 2022 108\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
