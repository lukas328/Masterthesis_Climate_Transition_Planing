defining how they should be \naddressed (response), adopting actions for their proper \nmitigation and minimization of exposure; \n•  Establishing and monitoring the internal control \nsystem; and \n•  Monitoring the priority indicators and risk mitigation \nstrategies.\nJust as important as the roles and responsibilities listed \nabove, BRF also clearly defines where the risks lie and \nhow the risk management process should be continuous-\nly applied, with the aim of ensuring that the pre-estab-\nlished directives are fulfilled and the Company's risks are \neffectively managed. \n All the governance described is led by the Global Risks \nDepartment, which has a mandate to ensure the proper \nand immediate management of the risks to which the \nCompany is exposed, as well as assume responsibility \nfor the due communication to, and training of, all those \ninvolved. \nAll the risks are evaluated and classified according to their \nimpact and likelihood of materializing and are consolidat-\ned in the Risk Map, which is revised periodically and de-\nlivered to the management team, the Board of Directors, \nand their advisory committees. \nFinally, the risk management is systematically monitored \nby the management team, which supports the perfor-\nmance of the actions designed to reduce the Company's \nlevels of exposure. \nBRF’s risk management process covers \nthe
