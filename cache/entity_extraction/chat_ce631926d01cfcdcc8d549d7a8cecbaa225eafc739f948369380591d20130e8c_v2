These targets underpin the initial iteration of our \nClimate transition plan, included within this report, guided by the work of GFANZ and the TPT.\n • NatWest Markets acted as co-ordinator of the newly established International Capital Market Association (ICMA) Sustainable Commercial Paper working group, contributing to the \ndevelopment of industry guidelines for this emerging asset class. We chaired the Financial Markets Standards Board (FMSB) ESG Ratings working group, producing a white paper examining \nESG rating methodologies and engagement.\n • We are members of the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative (NZAM) and the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC) to shape standards around net zero for the asset \nmanagement industry\n • Aligned with TCFD recommendations, CDP is considered the global benchmark for corporate environmental reporting. NatWest Group achieved a B score in the 2022 CDP Climate Change Survey.\n • We are a founding member of the Sustainable Markets Initiative (SMI), participating in the SMI’s Financial Services Taskforce. In 2022, the SMI awarded us the Terra Carta Seal to recognise \nour commitment to, and momentum towards, the creation of sustainable markets.\nEmbracing innovation to \nhelp accelerate change\n • NatWest Group is one of nine financial institutions that helped found and develop Carbonplace, a global first marketplace, which harnesses blockchain-enabled distributed ledger technology to \nenable the simple, secure, and transparent transfer of certified carbon credits.\n • As part of our ambition to help businesses benefit from the transition to net zero, we announced a new Clean Transport Accelerator hub in collaboration with the Warwick Manufacturing Group \n(WMG) at the University of Warwick, providing coaching, workspace and access to clean-energy, manufacturing and automotive experts.\n • In 2022, NatWest Group continued to partner with the Sustainable Food Trust (SFT) to support the development of the Global Farm Metric (GFM), a common framework of farm sustainability \nmetrics and an accompanying assessment tool that will enable farmers to measure their environmental and social impact. \nCollaborations \nsupporting \ndecarbonisation\n • Our continued partnership with Octopus Energy in 2022 intends to make it simple for customers and colleagues to move to electric vehicles (EVs). In 2022, both individual and business customers \nhave been able to have electric charging infrastructure installed at reduced cost.\n • Lombard has worked with Diode, an innovative technology start-up, to inform and support commercial customers looking to transition to EVs. The resulting Lombard EV Readiness Assessment \nhelps businesses choose the right replacement vehicles for their fleet, helps employees to pick an EV to suit their lifestyle and shows potential running cost and CO2 savings across the business. The \ntool also provides information on expected charging infrastructure needs, which can be supported though our partnership with Octopus Energy.\n • Following the launch of the Sustainable Homes and Buildings Coalition’s first Home is Where the Heat Is report in October 2021, we launched a demonstrator project in April 2022, to illustrate \nthe learnings and key challenges from a full retrofit journey across a spread of customer and housing types. Since then, we have worked together with British Gas, Worcester Bosch and retrofit \npartner Quidos Ltd to provide a fully funded end-to-end retrofit pilot. Announced through our second Home is Where the Heat Is report, launched at a Parliamentary event in October 2022, an \ninterim report on the pilot included a summary of key findings and customer experiences so far, as well as five key policy asks of the UK Government.\n • NatWest Group is a founding member of a consortium including Pineapple, British Gas, Schneider Electric and Places For People. The consortium is working with a range of housing \nassociations and local authorities to increase the scale of retrofit across the UK. The group aims to address the gaps in implementation capability, technical capacity and economic viability that \ncause failures in the market. NatWest Group is also supporting the environmental goals of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority Retrofit Taskforce, with an ambition to renovate \n887,000 homes, 700 local authority controlled schools and 2,700 public sector buildings as well as provide retrofit training to 80,000 existing construction workers. \nWe know combating climate change must be a collaborative and wide-reaching effort. Our plan is to work collaboratively with our partners, stakeholders and peers to deliver our climate ambition, keeping in mind accordance with \nrelevant anti-trust rules. During 2022, NatWest Group continued to engage with investors, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and other key stakeholders on the actions we are taking to play our part in addressing the climate \nchallenge.\nBelow we list some of the examples of how we’re partnering with others to unlock opportunities connected with the net zero transition. \n3.5\n47NatWest Group plc | 2022 Climate-related Disclosures Report\nGovernance Strategy and Climate transition plan Risk Management and Scenario Analysis Metrics and TargetsIntroduction\nClimate transition plan: \nEducation – colleague \nengagement \nIn April 2022 we announced a three-year partnership with the University of Edinburgh, investing £1.5 million \nto make climate education available to all NatWest Group colleagues.
