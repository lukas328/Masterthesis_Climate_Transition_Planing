Although \nthe US$100 billion commitment 14 may finally have \nbeen met, most assessed high-income countries \nneed to increase their share of contributions to \ninternational climate finance. Better disclosure of \ndeveloping countries’ climate finance needs could \nhelp facilitate financial flows.\nKey findings:\n14. At COP15 in 2009, developed economies committed to mobilising US$100 billion per year (initially by 2020) for climate action in    \n emerging economies.\nSustainability and Stewardship Report\n54\nPolicy advocacy\nAs investors, we have a role to play in advocating for changes in policy \nand regulation, and in helping enable sustainable development.\nPresidential Climate Commission: Just \nTransition Financing Mechanism engagement \nand consultation\nIn 2021, the South African government announced the Just Energy Transition \nPartnership at COP26 – a deal made by various governments to commit \ncapital to financing the country’s move away from coal power. In 2022, an \nInvestment and Implementation plan was developed by the Presidential Climate \nCommission (“PCC”) as a blueprint for how South Africa would approach \nthe core components of this economy-wide transition, with a key focus on \nits financing. Ninety One supported the PCC through active stakeholder \nengagement as a key private sector player and investor in the broader economy. \nIn 2023, the Just Transition Financing mechanism consultation was launched, \nwhich we participated in both in public forums and bilaterally. \nUK Transition Plan Taskforce: focus on \nmetals and mining workshop\nIn 2022, the UK Transition Plan Taskforce (“TPT”) conducted an industry \nconsultation, which we contributed to, to develop a sector-neutral Disclosure \nFramework. The framework sets out good practice for robust and credible \ntransition plan disclosure. This is supported by the TPT’s Interpretative \nGuidance, which assists in the preparation of credible, useful and consistent \ntransition plans in line with the TPT Disclosure Framework. In 2023, TPT \ndeveloped sector-specific guidance for a small number of sectors, including \nmetals and mining and financial institutions. We contributed to consultation \non the financial institution guidance and actively participated in the metals \nand mining working group. The draft guidance was published in September.\nChallenging on policy back-tracking\nWe advocate for policies that support a conducive environment for the \ntransition to net zero. In September 2023, we joined with other investors \nto support a letter from the IIGCC, UK Sustainable Investment and Finance \nAssociation (“UKSIF”) and the PRI to the UK Prime Minister to express concerns \nregarding backtracking on key policies, including the decision to delay phase-\nouts of new internal-combustion-engine car sales and gas boilers, and back-\ntracking on energy-efficiency targets. The letter reiterated the importance of \nan enabling policy environment as a prerequisite for investors looking to make \nlong-term investment and asset-allocation decisions to support the transition \nto net zero in the UK.\nSustainability and Stewardship Report\n55\nThought leadership \nNinety One’s Investment Institute delivers strategic investing insights \nand analysis to our investment teams and clients across asset classes, \ninvestment strategies and borders. The Institute seeks to play an active role \nin the global conversation on sustainable investing. \nCase study:\nPlanetary Pulse summary and findings\nNinety One’s annual Planetary Pulse research project \ninvestigates how asset owners are approaching the investment \nrisks and opportunities presented by climate change. \nConducted independently by FT Longitude, the research in \n2023 was based on a survey of 300 senior professionals at \nasset owners and advisors around the world, including pension \nfunds, insurers, endowments, foundations, central banks, \nsovereign wealth funds and consultants. \nNovember 2023\nPlanetary Pulse\nTargeting \neffectiveness\nAsset owners weigh risks and \nopportunities of investing for \nan inclusive energy transition\nAlmost half of asset owners (48%) have between one-\nquarter and half of their assets under management \n(“AUM”) invested in portfolios with climate-related \ninstructions or objectives, up from 40% in 2022. This \nrises to 75% for endowment funds, which typically \ninvest for designated purposes.\nA significant number of respondents say their \ninfrastructure (45%), private equity (50%), private debt \n(44%), corporate debt (41%) and listed equities (36%) \nasset classes are within the scope of their climate-related \nobjectives. Sovereign debt is the only asset class that \nfalls below this, at 17%.\nNearly half (49%) of asset owners have an emissions-\nreduction target in place for their fund, while 43% – rising \nto 54% in Asia-Pacific (APAC) – use Climate Value-at-Risk \n(VaR). In North America, the second-most-used target \ntype is portfolio coverage/asset-level alignment (40%) \nand, in Europe, it is implied temperature rise (44%). Nearly \ntwo-thirds of asset owners (61%, rising to 67% in North \nAmerica) use the same climate-related target type for all \nasset classes and funds.\nHighlights from the 2023 survey:\nSustainability and Stewardship Report\n56\nCase study:\nNet-zero investing: searching for returns and real-world change\nUsing practical examples, this paper , which was published \njust after the reporting period ended, sets out how we can \nevolve the approach to net-zero investing to achieve the dual \nobjectives of delivering decarbonisation in the real economy \nwhile optimising returns for clients and beneficiaries.
