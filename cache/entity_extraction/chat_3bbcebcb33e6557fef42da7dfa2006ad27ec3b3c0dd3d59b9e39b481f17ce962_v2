We have worked hard \nto improve the way we collect data on GHG \nemissions and are actively encouraging our \nsuppliers to do the same.\nBetter data has allowed us to set more \nstretching targets on a new baseline year \nof financial year 2020, that are grounded \nin science and will stimulate change.\nOur emissions data collection, accounting, \nand target setting is undertaken \nin accordance with the WRI/WBCSD \nGreenhouse Gas Reporting and Diageoâs \nreporting methodologies and protocols.\nWe have already made a considerable \nreduction in our Scope 1 GHG emissions \n(emissions from on-site energy consumption \nand owned vehicles relating to our direct \noperations), as well as our Scope 2 emissions \n(emissions from the electricity, steam, heating \nand cooling that we purchase), by reducing \nour energy demand, and by increasing our \nuse of renewable energy.\nWeâve also partnered with our suppliers \nto reduce our Scope 3 GHG emissions \n(emissions related to our supply chain \nactivities), including through reducing \nemissions from raw materials and packaging, \nin concert with our sustainable packaging \ntargets.\nOur 2020 emissions footprint encompasses \nthe impact of our products across our \nvalue chain, providing us with an accurate \nunderstanding of where we are now, and \nmore importantly, what we need to focus \non going forwards.\n\nNet-Zero \nEmissions\nFor illustrative purposes only. Total Value Chain GHG Emissions\n (tonnes CO2e)\n20502020\nRe-baselined emissions at \nstart of decade of action\n2030 2040\nCarbon Removals\nOur approach is to directly abate GHG \nemissions but it will also be necessary \nto neutralize residual emissions and also to \ncompensate emissions on our journey to \nnet zero and beyond.\nTaking action in this area is based on \nbest practice guidance, focusing on high-\nquality, nature-based solutions that donât \njust remove carbon from the atmosphere, \nbut also have wider co-benefits. Prioritising \nemission removals in our own value chain \nis also important as we continue to support \na number of projects in our Society 2030: \nSpirit of Progress action plan.\nWhile the number of voluntary carbon \ncredits we buy is relatively small, we use \nrecognised standards such as the Gold \nStandard or Verra, who aim to ensure \nthat projects that remove carbon from \nthe atmosphere also deliver benefits for \npeople and the planet in line with the UN \nSustainable Development Goals. This is \nan evolving space - we are committed to \nkeeping up to date and following the most \ncredible route for carbon removal.\n5\nOur Pathway to\n   Net Zero\n1.5Â°C Paris Aligned Pathway\nNet Value Chain Emissions (incl.

While we continue to \nemphasize reducing emissions from our own \noperations, we are also extending GHG \nemission reduction efforts to areas that we \ncan influence across our value chain, such \nas GHG emissions from our sourcing of raw \nmaterials, packaging and logistics.\nReaching net zero is our ultimate goal \nbut we do acknowledge that after our \ndecarbonisation action there will be some \nresidual emissions that it is simply not \nfeasible to eliminate. We will neutralise these \nresidual emissions (approximately 5-10% of \nbaseline emissions) to reach and maintain a \nstate of net zero.\nWe are following a science based pathway \nand will continue to revise our approach \nand plans in the transition to net zero. Using \nthe most up to date climate science & \nguidance, from organisations like Science \nBased Targets initiative (SBTi), will help us \ndrive impactful climate action.\nDiageo recognizes the important role that \nclimate finance plays in funding and scaling \nclimate-based solutions and as such will \nreview opportunities to support beyond \nvalue chain mitigation.
