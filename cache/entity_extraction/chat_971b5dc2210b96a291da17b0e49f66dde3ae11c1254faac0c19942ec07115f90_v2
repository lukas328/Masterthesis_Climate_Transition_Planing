A NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLAN INCLUDING THE MANAGED PHASEOUT OF  \nHIGH-EMITTING ASSETS \nThe Managed Phaseout approach outlined by GFANZ 90 allows financial institutions to provide asset \nowner-operators clarity that finance for high-emitting assets can be provided, but that it should be \nconditional on plans to cease operation of those assets over a timeframe that is consistent with the \nnet-zero transition. The Managed Phaseout approach is an emerging area of transition finance. \nThe approach recognizes that some high-emitting assets will need to be operated while no/low-\ncarbon alternatives are being developed. This can be an equivalent approach to a net-zero GHG \nemissions reduction pathway if the retirement date is 1.5 degrees C-aligned or earlier. The Managed \nPhaseout approach is relevant: to assets that may be viable today but are either at financial risk as \nthe global economy decarbonizes or are inconsistent with a 1.5 degrees C-aligned transition in their \ncurrent operations; and where assets cannot be redeveloped or retrofitted and so need to be retired \nover a suitable timeframe.\nFigure 13 shows the illustrative GHG emissions profiles for a single asset and a portfolio of assets. For \na single asset, a possible 1.5 degrees C-aligned GHG emissions profile could be for GHG emissions \nto remain largely constant and then stop completely upon closure (left graph). The latest retirement \npoint would need to be calibrated to be aligned with a 1.5 degrees C pathway. A company operating \nseveral high-emitting assets could potentially retire them at different times (right graph).\n \nFigure 13. Some high-emitting assets can continue to be operated in the short term, as\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
