Information regarding \nmovement in the provision and the ageing of insurance debtors, Medicare rebate and Risk Equalisation Special \nAccount recoveries is shown in Note 26.3. \n(a) Insurance debtors \nInsurance debtors primarily arise where the amount payable under an insurance contract is payable in instalments \nover the term of the policy, with a debtor and corresponding unearned premium provision being established at \ninception for the total premiums receivable over the whole period of cover. \n(b) Reinsurersâ€™ share of insurance provisions \nThe recoverables due from reinsurers are shown within assets arising from insurance business and are assessed for \nrecoverability at each reporting date. Reinsurersâ€™ share of insurance provisions are further analysed in Note 19. \n(c) Deferred acquisition costs \nAcquisition costs represent commissions payable and other expenses related to the acquisition of insurance \ncontract revenues recognised during the financial year. Acquisition costs that have been paid are deferred and \nrecognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in the period in which the benefit is recognised, on a straight-\nline basis. The movement in deferred acquisition costs is as follows: \n2022 2021 \nÂ£m Â£m \nAt beginning of the year 143 138 \nInitial application of IAS 29Â¹ 6 â€“ \nAcquisition costs deferred 499 380 \nAcquisition costs recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement (476) (373) \nForeign exchange 3 (2) \nAt end of year 175 143 \n1.

Further details on liability adequacy testing are included within Note 19. \n(d) Medicare rebate \nIn Australia, the government provides an income tested rebate to help people meet the cost of private health \ninsurance. Where customers have elected to receive the rebate as a premium reduction through their private \nhealth insurer, the amounts are recovered from the government. Rebates due from the government but not \nreceived at the reporting date are recognised in assets arising from insurance business. \nBupa Annual\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
