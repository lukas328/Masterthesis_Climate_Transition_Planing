As with mortgages, financing with \nsustainable products is encouraged when \nthe sustainability criteria are met, in this \ncase, for electric or plug-in hybrid cars.\nP.  65\nBBVA Report on TCFD 2022\nThis English version is a translation of the original in Spanish for information purposes only. In case of a discrepancy, the Spanish original will prevail.\nSECTION 03  / MANAGEMENT OF RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CLIMATE CHANGE\nLastly, as mentioned in previous sections, \nthe BBVA Group is committed to \nsustainable development, which is one of \nthe defining elements of BBVA’s business \nmodel. In this regard, the General Retail \nCredit Risk Policy establishes that one of \nthe general principles governing retail credit \nrisk management in the BBVA Group is \nrespect for equality and diversity, avoiding \nunfair bias in access to financial products \nfor reasons such as gender, color, ethnic \norigin, disability, religion, sexual orientation \nor political opinion.\nAdditionally, the General Risk Management \nModel Policy establishes that in order to \navoid unfair bias in access to financial \nproducts based on gender, color, \nethnic origin, disability, religion, sexual \norientation or political opinion, none of \nthese variables will be included in the \nadmission and pricing models.\nNon-financial risks related to \nsustainability\nIn order to identify and mitigate non-financial \nrisks related to sustainability, including \npossible risks arising from divergent \nopinions on ESG issues and policies, BBVA \nhas established specific working groups, \nwith the participation of all relevant business \nand control units. These working groups \nreview the main activities that may generate \nthis type of risk (communications, products, \ngoals and commitments, adherence to \ninitiatives, etc.), develop, in each case, \nthe appropriate control frameworks \nand check their implementation in the \nmanagement processes.\nClassification and \nmeasurement of physical risk\nPhysical risk is associated with the location \nof assets and vulnerability based on their \nactivity and can materialize in credit risk \nthrough different transmission channels, \nhaving an impact in multiple ways such as, \nfor example, on the purchasing power of \ncustomers, business productivity, market \ndemand or the value of assets. In 2022, \nBBVA learnt a great deal in this field and \nits level of maturity and knowledge of the \ndifferent methodologies for the assessment \nof physical risk has advanced considerably. \nHowever, these advances represent a first \napproximation due to the complexity of \ncarrying out an assessment of the exposure \nand impacts of physical risks.\nBBVA has continued to make progress \nin assessing the materiality of chronic \nand acute risks in the different portfolios. \nThe analysis of physical risk is articulated \naround three pillars: threat, exposure \nand vulnerability.\nP.  66\nBBVA Report on TCFD 2022\nThis English version is a translation of the original in Spanish for information purposes only. In case of a discrepancy, the Spanish original will prevail.\nSECTION 03 / MANAGEMENT OF RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CLIMATE CHANGE\nRegarding the threat, the methodology of \nthe Think Hazard tool of the World Bank \nhas been followed. This tool indicates the \nrisk levels of the different natural hazards, \nboth acute (cyclone, heat waves, fire \nand river flooding) and chronic (drought \nand coastal flooding) at a global level \nand in different detail depending on the \ngeographical area of the planet. These \nrisk levels are calculated based on the \nfrequency of occurrence and intensity \nof the different natural hazards. It is \nimportant to note that the information \nused is provided by a number of private, \nacademic and public organizations. In \naddition, work has been done to increase \nthe granularity of the risk levels offered \nby Think Hazard, using scientific and \ntechnical criteria, for the most relevant \nhazards in BBVA’s geographical areas, \nspecifically, tropical cyclones, coastal and \nriver flooding, and forest fire.\nFor the vulnerability component, during \n2022 the sectoral granularity of the \nanalysis for Wholesale Banking and SMEs \nhas been increased. This analysis is carried \nout based on 8 indicators that capture \ndirect and indirect physical impacts, \nso that the sensitivity of each sector to \nclimate hazards is indirectly assessed \nby analyzing its sensitivity to these \nvulnerability indicators. This methodology \nfollows the best practices identified by the \nT askforce on Climate-related Financial \nDisclosure (TCFD) and UNEP-FI. As a \nresult, a qualitative classification of the \n(sub)sectors is generated according to the \npotential impact on their business model \nand activity of chronic or acute changes in \nthe climate.\nThreat and vulnerability scores are applied \nat the contract level based on the location \nto identify prone exposure to physical risk. \nAs a result, the sectors identified as most \nvulnerable to physical risks have been power \ngeneration, basic materials, construction, \nconsumption, and real estate.\nGRAPH 02.
