The Risk Management Framework \nis described on page 63 above, which sets out Bupa’s \nprocess for the ongoing identification and management \nof these risks and emerging risks.

A full description \nof the Committee’s role is set out in its Terms of \nReference which are available here on bupa.com. \nThe Committee comprises five independent NEDs, all \nof whom are considered to have recent and relevant \nfinancial experience gained through their executive \nand non-executive careers. Two of the Committee \nmembers are chartered accountants. There are \ncross-memberships between the Committee, the \nRisk Committee, Remuneration Committee and the \nSustainability Committee to oversee risk management \nand internal control, to ensure an integrated approach \nto risk management and assurance between Group Risk \nand GIA, to provide input on the quality of the Group’s \nfinancial results to aid remuneration decisions and to \nfacilitate assurance over the reporting of data on \ngreenhouse gas emissions. See the Directors’ \nbiographies on page 59 for more information on each \nCommittee member’s qualifications and experience. \nThe Group CEO, Group CFO, Group Performance and \nFinance Transformation Director, CAO, CRO and lead \npartner of the External Auditor are routinely invited to \nattend Committee meetings. The Committee meets at \nleast annually with each of the External Auditor, CAO \nand Chief Actuary in the absence of management. \nI was appointed Chair of the Committee from 1 May \n2022 following Clare Thompson’s retirement from the \nBoard on 30 April 2022. I would like to thank her for \nher strong leadership of the Committee over the last \nseven years. \nKey activities in 2022 \nImpairments \nThe increased global uncertainty, specific developments \nin certain geographies and the increasing cost of capital \nduring the second half of 2022 have increased the \nsensitivity of past investments to impairment, over \nwhich the Committee exercises its judgement in \nundertaking goodwill and other asset impairments. \nManagement recognised material impairments across \na number of cash-generating units (CGUs) as at \n31 December 2022. \nManagement provided the Committee with increased \nanalysis across relevant market conditions, the key \njudgements and assumptions underpinning future \ncash flow models and enhanced sensitivity analysis. \nThis information was subject to enhanced scrutiny \nby the Committee at both the half year 2022, where \nindicators of potential impairment were identified \n(and public disclosure was made of the risks and \nuncertainties which could over time lead to impairments \nbeing required), and ahead of approval of the 2022 \nAnnual Report. At the half year 2022, the Committee \nconcluded that no impairments were required; however, \nthe cost of capital increased and specific challenges \nin certain businesses developed during the second \nhalf of the year, resulting in asset impairments for a \nnumber of CGUs. Where impairments were identified \nfor UK Care Services, Bupa Dental Care UK, Bupa \nChile and BVAC Australia, the Committee considered \nthe appropriateness of the quantum of those \nimpairments and also the related disclosure within \nthe Financial Statements. \nInsurance claims reserving \nManagement chose to cease accruals for the Deferred \nClaims Liability (DCL) provision from Q4 2022 as \nCOVID-19 is no longer causing significant disruption \nto the availability of services. The DCL will not be \nrecognised in 2023 following the implementation \nof IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts from 1 January 2023. \nThe Committee considered the Group Chief Actuary’s \nreport on the appropriateness of the overall level of \ninsurance reserves, including the level of prudential \nmargin. In reviewing and approving the insurance \nreserves, the Committee also took into consideration \nthe External Auditor’s report to the Committee and\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
