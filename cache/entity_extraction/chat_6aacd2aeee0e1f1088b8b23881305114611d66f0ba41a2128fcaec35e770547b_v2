We have used the Committee for \nClimate Change BNZ Pathways as well as \nInternational Energy Agency’s Beyond 2°C World \nScenario (B2DS) pathway aligned with SBTi \nguidance to estimate these targets.\n • See sections 5.5 and 5.7 for details of scenarios \nused, methodologies and limitations.\nSBTi targets methodology:\n • We have used the SBTi Temperature Rating \nMethodology to assess temperature rating targets. \nWhere available, we used GHG emissions reduction \ntargets disclosed by customers through CDP to \ncalculate temperature scores for each customer. \nCustomers who did not have externally disclosed \ntargets through CDP were assigned a default \nscore of 3.2°C.\n • Customer temperature scores were aggregated \nto calculate a NatWest Group temperature rating \nby using the weighted average temperature score \n(WATS) methodology, which weights customer \ntargets based on their proportion in a portfolio.\n • See section 5.5 and 5.7 for details of scenarios used, \nmethodologies and limitations for lending and page \n45 for further detail on Financial Institutions. \nPortfolio alignment methodology:\n • Portfolio alignment targets measure the \npercentage of fund managers setting and achieving \nnet-zero targets.\n • The assessment combines qualitative and \nquantitative measures of the credibility of funds’ \nand companies’ net-zero strategy  and targets. We \nconsider forward-looking targets as well as \nprogress against targets, which forms the basis of \nnet zero engagement with funds\n • By selecting funds that demonstrate progress \nagainst credible net-zero strategies and targets we \nare more likely to gain exposure to underlying \ncompanies that are decarbonising.\nCarbon intensity methodology:\n • See section 1.3 and page 45 for further details. \nSBTi targets methodology:\n • Target alignment has been calculated using \nquantitative indicators, and reviewed regularly \nfor credibility and impact.\n • Our operational value chain excludes processing \nof our sold goods, as our products are not \nmanufactured. Included within our reporting \nis emissions from assets we lease and occupy, \nas well as franchise emissions.\n • See section 3.7 and 5.4 for further details. \nClimate transition plan: Explaining our \nclimate ambition and SBTi targets\nOur ambition to be net zero by 2050 across our finance emissions, assets under management and operational \nvalue chain is supported by our 2030 ambitions noted in the table below. Aligned with our ambition to set \nsector-specific targets, during 2022 we published 2030 targets validated by the SBTi as science-based. These \ntargets included our own operational emissions as well as 79% of our 2019 lending book. SBTi targets have been \nset based on a number of methodologies, external scenarios, pathways and assumptions that vary by sector. \nPlease refer to sections 5.4 and 5.5 for details of these. We have dependencies on timely and appropriate \ngovernment policies and other external factors such as customer behaviour changes and technology \ndevelopments. Refer to section 3.4 for details of key policies.

This will form the basis for further work on our journey to net zero by \n2050 across our financed emissions, AuM and our operational value chain. We have used available \nguidance, including GFANZ, Transition Planning Taskforce and TCFD recommendations, to inform \nthe development of our transition plan.\nDuring 2022, we focused on developing transition plans at a sector level, aligned with our work on estimation of \ncarbon emissions and emissions intensities. This activity prioritised sectors with high emissions and emission \nintensities, balance sheet materiality as well as those sectors for which we have set validated science-based \ntargets. Overall, we have set transition plans for 72% of our lending book as at December 2019. To develop \ntransition plans for financing activity, we considered the following:\nBusiness operations, products and services\n • Supporting our customers’ transition is a key driver in the development and delivery of our transition plans. \nWe have worked with the business teams within each sector to identify products, services and business \noperation changes that can be made available to support customer transition.\n •\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
