To mitigate any potential conflict of interest, \nproxy voting has been closely monitored to ensure that complete independence \nwas achieved. After the Naspers 2017 AGM, Ninety One decided that the \npotential conflict of interest was best managed by referring all Naspers and \nProsus voting-related matters directly to clients. We have followed this process \nsince then. We make a recommendation to clients on how we would vote and \noffer them the option to either follow our recommendation or direct the vote as \nthey see fit.\n ɽ Fundamental transactions: From time to time, Ninety One on behalf of its clients \nmay become involved on both sides of a fundamental transaction. In such cases, \nNinety One will seek to ensure that all appropriate factors are considered prior to any \ntransaction or recommendation taking place. If necessary, it will engage directly with \nits clients to determine an appropriate course of action. Ninety One would ultimately \naim to act in the best interests of clients, in line with their mandate, which may result \nin a divergence of actions.\n ɽ Nominating directors:  Ninety One will endeavour, where appropriate, to nominate \ncandidates that it objectively considers to be independent of Ninety One. Should \nNinety One deem it necessary to nominate a candidate that is in any way affiliated to \nitself, it will ensure that the candidate is not presented with any conflicts of interest \nthat may impact their ability to fulfil their responsibilities as a director, or as an \nemployee of Ninety One.\n ɽ Engagement: In theory, there is a risk that Ninety One could favour some companies \nin the engagement process where Ninety One has a prior relationship and so would \nbe failing in its duty to treat all its clients equally. To mitigate such a risk, Ninety One has \nestablished a governance structure to ensure that these situations are appropriately \nidentified and managed, including all strategic engagements being monitored by the \nSustainability team.\n4. Signatories identify \nand respond to market-\nwide and systemic \nrisks to promote a \nwell-functioning \nfinancial system.\nOur approach to systemic risks \nWe look to identify market-wide and systemic risks, both to manage portfolio risks and \nto promote well-functioning financial systems. Sustainability risks can be identified in \na number of ways including through our investment teams’ bottom-up research, our \nSustainability team’s oversight and industry advocacy networks, and our investment risk \nprocess.\nThe Investment Risk team performs a ‘safety net’ function, identifying – and challenging \nour investment teams on – ESG issues, including market-wide and systemic risks. Metrics \nsuch as these are also used in the risk-monitoring process, alongside data from other \nsources. We improved the monitoring that we do in monthly risk meetings by creating \ncompany focus-lists based on a review of internal and external data flags, by tracking \nexposure of investment strategies to these focus lists, and more recently by tracking \nengagement activity. This helps us better understand exposure to ESG risks across the \ninvestment teams, and gain comfort with the quality of ESG integration into investment \nprocesses. At the firm level, we monitor exposure to investments that flag on various third-\nparty ESG metrics. We believe that this process has worked effectively over the reporting \nperiod.\n87\nSustainability and Stewardship Report\nPrinciple Ninety One’s activities \n4. Signatories identify \nand respond to market-\nwide and systemic \nrisks to promote a \nwell-functioning \nfinancial system \n(continued). \nWe recognise climate change and corporate governance as key material market-wide \nsustainability risks. \n ɽ We made significant progress on our work to address systemic risks linked to climate \nchange, particularly as part of our approach to meeting our net-zero targets over the \nreporting period. We further developed our Transition Plan Assessment Framework \nto assess our top emitters across the firm and developed engagement plans for \neach company. Please refer to page 22 for further detail on our progress and pages \n17 and 18 for examples of how our different investment teams consider carbon risk at \na strategy level. \n ɽ Governance failures are a perennial threat to companies’ ability to create long-\nterm sustainable value. Ninety One seeks to ensure boards focus on creating \nand preserving sustainable value through an effective system of governance. \nCorporate-governance analysis is integrated into our investment teams’ research. \nPlease see page 34 for details about the recently formed Governance Group, which, \namong other things, assesses and seeks to improve Ninety One’s stewardship \npolicies.\nWith an increasing focus on, and understanding of, nature-related investment risks, we \nare in the process of developing a specific framework to support our investment teams in \nidentifying, analysing and managing these risks.\nPlease refer to the Advocacy section of the report for information on how we have worked \nwith other industry participants to promote continued improvement of the functioning \nof financial markets and Appendix 5 for our contribution to the industry groups we are \ninvolved in. \n5. Signatories review \ntheir policies, assure their \nprocesses and assess \nthe effectiveness of \ntheir activities.\nOur sustainability-related policy documents are reviewed by our Sustainability team \nevery two years and are tabled for review and approval by the Global Policies Committee, \nwhich comprises senior members of the business from Executive Management, Legal, \nCompliance, Company Secretary and Operations (oversight and risk). Any material \nchanges to the policies are also reviewed and approved by the Sustainability Committee. \nWe have largely taken assurance for internal purposes of our stewardship activities to \ndate. The Sustainability Committee’s remit covers the continued enhancement and \nmanagement of Ninety One’s stewardship position and oversees the implementation \nand effectiveness of the related policies.
