Tracking progress in a portfolio\nFINANCIAL  \nINSTITUTION TRACKING OF PROGRESS\nING117 Launched in 2018, the Terra approach was designed to enable ING to measure and steer alignment of \nits lending portfolio with the Paris Agreement goals. In its 2021 Climate Report, ING reported that five \nof nine sectors are on track with climate alignment pathways, with three others close, and only one not \non track.\nBarclays118 Using its BlueTrackTM methodology to measure, track, and set targets on its financed emissions, \nBarclays is now reporting progress against its 2020 baselines. The BlueTrack TM methodology allows \nBarclays to make active choices to reshape their portfolio within their “carbon limit” for each sector, \nestimating the emissions that their clients produce and how those emissions should be linked to the \nfinancing they provide.  \nSelected targets and progress\nÝëè\u0003÷äåïè\u0003åèïòú\u0003öè÷ö\u0003òø÷\u0003öèïèæ÷èç\u0003÷äõêè÷ö\u0003äñç\u0003óòïìæìèö\u0003úè\u0003ëäùè\u0003óõèùìòøöïü\u0003äññòøñæèç\u0006\u0003\nprogress against them, and the new announcements we are now making.\nStrategic pillar Previously announced target/policy Progress4 New announcement \nBy the end of 2021 2021 Performance\n ¡( ]ÐÑÐèðìööìòñõèçøæ÷ìòñÜæòóè!2 and 23 \n¤ðäõîè÷¡åäöèç¥\u0003äêäìñö÷\u0003ä\u0003\" !(\u0003åäöèïìñè\n Üòøõæè\u0003) ]\u0003õèñèúäåïè\u0003èïèæ÷õìæì÷ü\u0003éòõ\u0003òøõ\nglobal operations\n ¡(&]\u0003ÐÑÐ\u0003èðìööìòñ\nreduction\n )$]\u0003õèñèúäåïè\u0003èïèæ÷õìæì÷ü\n Ìäõåòñ\u0003ñèø÷õäï\u0003éòõ\u0003Üæòóè\u0003\n1, Scope 2 and Scope 35\nbusiness travel emissions \nsince 2020 \n ¡) ]\u0003ÐÑÐ\u0003èðìööìòñ\u0003õèçøæ÷ìòñ\u0003ìñ\u0003Üæòóè\u0003!\u0003äñç\u0003\"\u0003¤ðäõîè÷¡\nåäöèç¥åü÷ëèèñçòé\" \"%äêäìñö÷ä\" !(åäöèïìñè\n Üòøõæè\u0003!  ]\u0003õèñèúäåïè\u0003èïèæ÷õìæì÷ü\u0003éòõ\u0003òøõ\u0003êïòåäï\nòóèõä÷ìòñöåüèñçòé\" \"%\nBy the end of 2025 2021 Performance By the end of 2030 6 \nPortfolio \nreduction \ntargets\nEnergy �\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>FINANCIAL INSTITUTION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Financial institutions are organizations that provide financial services, including banking, investment, and asset management, and are increasingly adopting net-zero transition plans to align their portfolios with climate goals)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ING<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ING is a financial institution that launched the Terra approach in 2018 to measure and steer its lending portfolio's alignment with the Paris Agreement goals, reporting progress in its Climate Report)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BARCLAYS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Barclays is a financial institution that uses the BlueTrackTM methodology to measure, track, and set targets on its financed emissions, actively reshaping its portfolio within carbon limits)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MSCIFOSSIL FUEL RESERVES SCREEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A screening tool used by funds to evaluate fossil fuel exposure in publicly listed companies, including those with fossil fuel reserves)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ING<|>PERSON<|>ING's representative or analyst involved in climate strategy and portfolio tracking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BARCLAYS<|>PERSON<|>Barclays' climate strategy team utilizing BlueTrackTM methodology)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARIS AGREEMENT<|>EVENT<|>International climate accord aiming to limit global warming, which financial institutions align their portfolios with through net-zero plans)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLIMATE REPORT<|>EVENT<|>A report published by ING detailing its progress and strategies toward climate alignment)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLUE TRACKTM<|>EVENT<|>Methodology developed by Barclays to measure and manage financed emissions within their portfolio)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Terra approach<|>EVENT<|>ING's strategy launched in 2018 to measure and steer its lending portfolio toward climate goals)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ING<|>PARIS AGREEMENT<|>ING's climate strategies are aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BARCLAYS<|>BLUE TRACKTM<|>Barclays uses the BlueTrackTM methodology to measure and manage its financed emissions<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ING<|>CLIMATE REPORT<|>ING publishes a Climate Report to communicate its progress on climate goals<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BARCLAYS<|>CLIMATE STRATEGY<|>Barclays' climate strategy involves using BlueTrackTM to set and track emissions targets<|>7)\n##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
