For our FY2021 qualitative evaluations, we expanded our scope to 19 sectors to keep in line with the \nrecommended disclosures from the TCFD Recommendations. (The previous evaluation only targeted 10 sectors.) \n \nBased on sector-specific GHG emissions, carbon efficiency, and other evaluation criteria, we categorized transition risk into five \nlevels: “Very high”, “high”, “medium”, “low”, and “very low”. These were used as reference when choosing sector s for scenario \nanalysis. We also rated physical risk and the size of clients ’ business opportunities as fitting into one of three levels, and are \nworking to increase risk awareness regarding climate change.

Following the November 2021 revisions to the guidance, the scope of the \nrecommended sectors has been expanded to the 18 sectors defined below. \nEnergy Transportation Materials and Buildings Agriculture, Food, and Forest \nProducts \n•Oil and Gas \n•Coal \n•Electric Utilities \n•Air Freight \n•Passenger Air Transportation \n•Maritime Transportation \n•Rail Transportation \n•Trucking Services \n•Automobiles and Components \n•Metals and Mining \n•Chemicals \n•Construction Materials \n•Capital Goods \n•Real Estate Management and \nDevelopment \n•Beverages \n•Agriculture \n•Packaged Food and Meats \n•Paper and Forest Products \nOur qualitative evaluation and the  sector-specific analysis of our exposure and financed emissions cover all of the \nrecommended sectors listed above. (A number of the sectors have been split, combined, or added.) \n  \nTCFD Report 2022  -39- \n \n5. Scenario analysis \nAt Mizuho, we conduct scenario analysis in order to ascertain the future impact of climate change on our group portfolio. We \nconduct the analysis under a number of scenarios, including a 1.5°C scenario, for the purpose of increasing the flexibility of plans \nand resilience of strategy in anticipation of various future climate change-related circumstances. \n \n(1) Transition risk scenario analysis \na. Targets of analysis \nTaking into account the results of our qualitative evaluation (Figure 7) and the sector-specific status of our portfolio (see page 52 \nfor sector-specific credit exposure), out of the sectors rated as “very high”, or “high” in our qualitative evaluation, the electric utilities, \noil, gas, coal, and steel sectors were chosen as the targets of our analysis. In addition, the automobile sector was identifi ed as \npresenting considerable business opportunities for our clients. As such, we added it to the targeted se ctors, as per the previous \nyear, in order to confirm the impact associated risk may have on our pursuit of finance opportunities (Table 6). \n \nTable 6: Target of transition risk scenario analysis \n Previous Current (underlines indicate changes) \nSectors targeted in \ntransition risk analysis \nElectric utilities, oil, gas, coal, and automobile \nsectors \n(worldwide) \nElectric utilities, oil, gas, coal, automobile, and \nsteel sectors \n(worldwide) \n \nb. Scenario and analysis methodology \nWe used the following four scenarios formulated by the NGFS in our transition risk analysis: Net Zero 2050, Below 2°C, Delayed \nTransition, and Current Policies (Figure 8). We chose to use NGFS scenarios with comprehensive region-specific parameters for \nour new 1.5°C scenario analysis. In addition, for sectors like the automobile sector, where NGFS scenarios are lacking in \nparameters, we have supplemented our analysis with literature referenced from the IEA and other sources. \n \nSee Table 7 for sector-specific perspectives on each sector. See Figure 9 for the main parameters utilized in our analysis. \n  \nCEO message\nOverview/Introduction\nGovernance\nStrategy\nRisk management\nMetrics and targets\nConclusion\nAppendix\n \n-40- Mizuho Financial Group \n \nFigure 8: Scenario details on transition risk \n Scenario details (NGFS scenarios)\nBelow 2°C\nNet Zero 2050\nDelayed \nTransition\nCurrent Policies\nScenario which assumes only currently implemented policies \nare preserved\nScenario which assumes a \ngradual increase in \nstringency of climate \npolicies, and a rise in global \ntemperature limited to \nbelow 2°C.
