Our growing business of coated membranes is enabling \nthe next generation of low carbon hydrogen technology, and our catalysts reduce pollution \nand help the global chemical industry de-fossilise. All this is underpinned by our circular PGM \neconomy that helps reduce waste and make the most of scarce resources. ForÂ decades our \nexpertise in metal chemistry has helped to solve the complex challenges ofÂ air pollution, and \nnow our technologies are accelerating the transition to net zero. \nThis year we have decided to scale up our ambition and announce tougher GHG reduction \ntargets for 2030 which will firmly put us on Science Based Targets initiativeâs (SBTi)1.5Â°C \ntrajectory and place us among the leading group of global businesses aiming for a rise of \nnoÂ more than 1.5Â°C. WeÂ have submitted them to SBTi for validation, as part of our Net Zero \nStandard application. \nERM Certification and Verification Services have provide limited assurance to ISAE3000 \nstandard of selected KPIs with 2030 targets.

Our capabilities, experience \nand scale put us in a great position to play to win in additional emerging markets, such as \nclean hydrogen and sustainable fuels.\nLast year we set ourselves the target that Johnson Matthey technologies would contribute \ntowards avoiding 50 million tonnes of GHGs entering the atmosphere per year by 2030, \ncompared to conventional technologies in 2020. This is equivalent to avoiding the \nemissions from half of UK transport2.
