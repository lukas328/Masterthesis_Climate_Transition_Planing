Developments in our approach to managing climate-related risks in 2022 \ninclude: \n(i) Property climate risk assessments have commenced for all sites, starting \nin the UK (refer to above section for more information). \n(ii) Climate targets and limits were agreed in 2021, as part of our approach \nto Responsible Investment. In 2022 we took action to reduce portfolio \nemissions, embedding targets within investment strategies and reducing \nexposure to higher carbon intensity issuers. \n(iii) The new Enterprise Sustainability Policy, referenced in the TCFD \nGovernance section, will continue to be embedded in 2023, through \nthe deployment of controls and continuous monitoring standards. \n(iv) The Climate-related Guidance Working Group is a global, cross-functional \nworking group which develops thematic, risk-based, practical guidance to \nimprove resilience to the physical impacts of climate change. This Working \nGroup aims to complement existing business continuity and clinical \nguidance by bringing a thematic focus on physical climate risk \nconsiderations (e.g. in 2022 it finalised its aged care heatwave guidance \nwhich shares good practice across Bupa). \n(v) The sustainability strategy, specifically the Mission Zero pillar, supports \nthe consideration and management of the risks climate change poses \nto Bupa but also the risk Bupa operations pose to the climate and wider \nenvironment. In addition, our BSC advises the Board and Executive on \nenvironment and climate change risk. \nC. We continue to integrate climate risk management into our existing Group-\nwide Risk Management Framework (RMF) which sets out how we identify, \nassess, manage and report on risks. We will continue to ensure that climate-\nrelated risks are considered appropriately throughout our governance \narrangements, including the policy framework and management committees’ \nresponsibilities. We also continue to reflect on changes in regulatory \nexpectations (e.g. from the PRA) while embedding climate risk through the \nRMF. The Group Risk Function is responsible for the oversight of identification \nand management of financial, and other, risks from climate change throughout \nthe Group. \nFor more information \non our risk \nidentification, risk \nmanagement culture \nand controls, see the \nBupa's system of \ngovernance section \non page 63 \nFor details on which \nof our significant risks \nmay be affected by \nclimate change, see \nthe Risk section \npages 46-47 \nFor further details \non our Responsible \ninvestment approach, \nsee page 32 and the \nResponsible Investment \nstatement here \nBupa Annual Report 2022 105 \n \n \n          \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n    \n  \n \n \n \n   \n   \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n              \n          \n         \n        \n           \n               \n         \n          \n            \n             \n  \n            \n             \n           \n      \n              \n                 \n            \n               \n    \n             \n          \n          \n            \n             \n            \n           \n            \n        \n   \n  \n   \n  \n     \n  \n \n    \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n   \n   \n   \n    \n  \n    \n \n  \n  \n   \n   \n          \n   \n   \n   \nStrategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements \nTask Force on Climate-related \nFinancial Disclosures (TCFD) continued \nTCFD \nRecommendation Details and Our Progress in 2022 Where can I find out more? \nMetrics and \ntargets \nA.
