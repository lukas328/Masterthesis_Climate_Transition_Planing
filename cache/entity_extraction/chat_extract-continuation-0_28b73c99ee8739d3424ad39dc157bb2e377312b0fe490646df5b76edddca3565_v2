The recoverable amounts of the cash-generating \nunits (CGUs) are determined using value in use calculations which generally use cash flow projections based on financial budgets and plans covering a three-year period approved by management. \nThe budgets and plans are based on a number of assumptions, including market share, impact of carbon pricing, expected changes to selling prices, product profitability, precious metal prices and \nother direct input costs, based on past experience and management’s expectations of future changes in the markets using external sources of information where appropriate. We also considered \nthe physical risk of climate change – including the effect of extreme weather events at sample strategic sites, based on internal and external analysis. \nSignificant CGUs \nGoodwill arising on the acquisition of businesses is allocated, at acquisition, to the CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.

Refer to note 6 for further information.  \n  \nNotes on the Accounts continued for the year ended 31st March 2023 \n171 \n5 Impairment losses continued \nKey assumptions used in value in use \nUnallocated corporate costs are split between CGUs based on their share of contribution. The three-year cash flows are extrapolated using the long term average growth rates for the relevant \nproducts, industries and countries in which the CGUs operate.  \nThe expected economic life of the Heavy Duty Catalysts has been restricted to 2040 reflecting internal climate change targets and impact of legislation changes. In the medium term, growth will \ncome from tightening emissions legislation driving demand for more sophisticated catalyst systems. Beyond the medium term, the world will increasingly use alternatives to the internal \ncombustion engine which is reflected in the long-term decline rate used in our modelling.  \nPre-tax discount rates, derived from the group’s post-tax weighted average cost of capital of 8.0% (2022: 7.7%), adjusted for the risks applicable to each CGU are used to discount these projected \nrisk-adjusted cash flows. \nThe key assumptions are: \n \nDiscount rate Long term growth rate \n2023 2022 2023 2022 \nClean Air  \n• Heavy Duty Catalysts 12.1% 11.6% –10.5% –15.1% \nCatalyst Technologies 10.8% 10.2% 3.0% 3.0% \nDifferent long term growth rates are used for the Clean Air - Heavy Duty Catalysts CGU because of expected macroeconomic trends in the industry in which the business operates. The growth rate \nfor years four to ten is expected to be 2.2% (2022: 2.7%). After that, growth is expected to decline and, therefore, the long term growth rate above is used for year eleven onwards.  \nSensitivity analysis \nThe headroom for the significant CGUs, calculated as the difference between net assets including allocated goodwill at 31st March 2023 and the value in use calculations, is shown below. The table \nalso shows, for each significant CGU, the headroom assuming a 1% decrease in the growth rate assumption and a 1% increase in the discount rate assumption used in the value in use calculations. \n \nHeadroom\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>JOHNSON MATTHEY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Johnson Matthey is a global specialty chemicals and sustainable technologies company that produces catalysts, chemicals, and other advanced materials, and reports financial performance including goodwill and impairment losses in its annual reports)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLEAN AIR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A division within Johnson Matthey focused on air pollution control technologies, including catalysts for heavy-duty vehicles)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CATALYST TECHNOLOGIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A division within Johnson Matthey specializing in catalyst development and manufacturing for various industrial applications)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VALUE BUSINESSES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A segment within Johnson Matthey comprising smaller business units with goodwill allocations, including diagnostic services)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEAVY DUTY CATALYSTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A significant business unit within Johnson Matthey's Clean Air division, producing catalysts for heavy-duty vehicles, with goodwill valued at £87m in 2023)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CATALYST TECHNOLOGIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A division within Johnson Matthey producing catalysts, with goodwill valued at £268m in 2023)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OTHER1,2<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A segment representing smaller CGUs with goodwill balances less than £5 million, including diagnostic services which has been impaired by £4 million)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DIAGNOSTIC SERVICES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A business unit within Johnson Matthey's Value Businesses segment, involved in diagnostic testing and services, with impaired goodwill)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>2023<|>EVENT<|>The fiscal year ending 31st March 2023, during which impairment losses and goodwill allocations are reported)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>2022<|>EVENT<|>The previous fiscal year, providing comparative data for goodwill and impairment analysis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FIRUZABAD<|>GEO<|>A location mentioned in example context, not directly related to the Johnson Matthey report but used as a template for entity extraction)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AURELIA<|>GEO<|>A country or region referenced in example context, not directly related to the Johnson Matthey report but used as a template for entity extraction)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KROHAARA<|>GEO<|>A location in the example context, not directly related to Johnson Matthey)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TIRUZIA<|>GEO<|>A location in the example context, not directly related to Johnson Matthey)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CASHION<|>GEO<|>A location in the example context, not directly related to Johnson Matthey)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOHNSON MATTHEY<|>CLEAN AIR<|>Johnson Matthey's division focused on air pollution control technologies<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOHNSON MATTHEY<|>CATALYST TECHNOLOGIES<|>A division within Johnson Matthey specializing in catalysts<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOHNSON MATTHEY<|>VALUE BUSINESSES<|>Segment comprising smaller units including diagnostic services<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLEAN AIR<|>HEAVY DUTY CATALYSTS<|>Heavy Duty Catalysts are part of the Clean Air division<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLEAN AIR<|>CATALYST TECHNOLOGIES<|>Catalyst Technologies is a division within Johnson Matthey, related to the Clean Air segment<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VALUE BUSINESSES<|>OTHER1,2<|>Other1,2 are part of the Value Businesses segment<|>8)\n##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
