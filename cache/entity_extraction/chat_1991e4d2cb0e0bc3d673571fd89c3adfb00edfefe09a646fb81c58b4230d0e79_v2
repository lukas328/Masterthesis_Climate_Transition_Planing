Find the right green products for you .\n114 Nationwide Building Society. Climate-related Financial Disclosures 2022 , 2022.\nAccording to Nationwide Building Society, a mutual owned by its 16.3 million members, the 29 million homes in \nthe UK account for 16% of the country’s total carbon emissions. 111 Reducing these emissions and addressing the \nbarriers to retrofit is a cross-industry challenge. \nFor its part, Nationwide has developed new green products and services focused on home energy efficiency to help \nreach its commitment to net zero by 2050. By offering innovative financing programs, it aims to improve the energy \nperformance certificate (EPC) ratings of its mortgage portfolio such that by 2030, at least 50% of homes on its \nmortgage book will be EPC C or better. Nationwide has launched propositions across three key real estate markets:\n 1. Purchasing of new energy-efficient  homes\n2. Retrofitting for homeowners\n3. Retrofitting for landlords\n \nIn 2020–21, Nationwide: 112, 113, 114\n• launched a Green Additional Borrowing mortgage product to its members to help make energy-efficient \nhome improvements;\n• partnered with Switchd to offer its members and colleagues a free six-month trial of their auto-energy tariff \nswitching service, which includes green options;\n• launched a solar panel pilot program with MakeMyHouseGreen, aiming to help 300 customers install solar \npanels on their homes;\n• contacted approximately 70,000 The Mortgage Works customers (around 33% of Nationwide’s buy-to-let book) \nwho did not appear to have a valid EPC, with the aim to remind them of the regulation and educate them about \nenergy efficiency;\n• progressed its Oakfield development in Swindon, consisting of 239 homes built to high environmental \nstandards, which it hopes will provide a blueprint for future sustainable homes;\n• launched the Green Reward Mortgage product to members, offering cash back for properties with an EPC  \nof A or high B; and \n• launched the Green Further Advance Mortgage to The Mortgage Works customers to help them make energy-\nefficient home  improvements.\nIMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY\nCONTENTS  |  FINANCIAL INSTITUTION NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLANS — FUNDAMENTALS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND GUIDANCE\n45\nThrough its products and services, Nationwide is attempting to accelerate the net-zero transition in the real \neconomy and is providing transition-related education and advice to retail customers, consistent with  \nGFANZ recommendations.  \nNationwide notes, however, that public policy changes are also required if it is to meet its net-zero objectives. \nGovernment policies and regulations promoting high energy-efficiency standards for new homes and retrofit \nincentives for homeowners and occupiers to cut their carbon emissions are considered particularly important \nfor reaching a net-zero economy.115 Nationwide has introduced its products to cater to the increase in demand \nexpected as policies and regulations are  introduced.\n115 Ibid., p. 55.\nIMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY\nCONTENTS  |  FINANCIAL INSTITUTION NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLANS — FUNDAMENTALS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND GUIDANCE\n46\nOverview and relevance: Financial institutions \nuse analytical tools and review processes to \nevaluate and inform decisions on all financing \nactivities, including risk-return ratios in investments, \nunderwriting, lending, approving new clients, and \nmore. These tools and processes form the core \nbusiness operations, and most do not account \nfor transition objectives. If institutions are to align \nbusiness activities with net-zero commitments, \nthen they should integrate net-zero data, targets, \nand objectives into these evaluation and decision-\nmaking tools and processes.  \nGuidance: The integration should be guided by \nany specific net-zero objective or target for that \nbusiness and mindful of sector-specific priority \ntransition activities. Where there is no specific \nobjective or target, processes should still align with \nthe institution’s net-zero ambition. Core decision-\nmaking processes vary across the financial sector, \nand may involve the following:\n116 Examples include the Green Bond Principles, Green Loan Principles, and the work of the Climate Bonds Initiative.\n• transaction approvals\n• lending approvals\n• investment mandate allocations\n• direct investment allocations\n• credit underwriting\n• insurance underwriting\n• client and/or investment due diligence\nCriteria used in decision-making should reflect \nany conditions laid out in policies. Where possible, \nconsider adjustments that integrate transition-\nrelevant data, information, and implications into the \ndetailed analytical processes, statements, terms \nof reference, or procedures that underpin the core \ndecision-making processes. For instance,  by:\n• adjusting factors in risk models and expected \nreturn models, such as discount rate or credit \nquality/ratings, based on a view of the transition;\n• adding transition-related diligence questions to \ncommittee processes or reviews of third parties, \nsuch as asset managers, OCIOs, investment \nconsultants, and subject matter  experts;\n• utilizing a recognized framework116 to assess the \nplan for sustainability-linked finance; and\n• incorporating client and portfolio company \ntransition plans/progress; third-party \nassessments of client/portfolio company \nactions; sector dec\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
