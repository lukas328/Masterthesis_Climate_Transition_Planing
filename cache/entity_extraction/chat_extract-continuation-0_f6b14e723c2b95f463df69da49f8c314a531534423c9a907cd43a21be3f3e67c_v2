JUST TRANSITION AND NATURE  \nIN NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLANS\nGFANZ believes the transition to a net-zero \neconomy should be a just transition and should \nstrengthen nature and biodiversity. \nTransition activities, such as replacing high-  \nemitting activities with low-emitting alternatives, \nhave the potential to disadvantage workers, \ncommunities, and already marginalized social \ngroups. At the same time, transition activities \ncan also contribute positively to economic \nopportunity, energy access and affordability, \nand community resilience. \nTransition activities can also have unintended \nnegative consequences on nature and \nbiodiversity. At the same time, protecting \nnature and biodiversity can play an important \nrole in mitigating climate change, and transition \nactivities can be pursued in ways that contribute \npositively to nature. \nGFANZ has outlined these important topics  \nas areas requiring further work to develop  \npan-sector guidance on how financial \ninstitutions can integrate them into transition \nplans, discussed in the Financial Institution \nNet-zero Transition Plans — Supplemental \nInformation report. In the meantime, financial \ninstitutions can use existing guidance and \ndevelop their own understanding and practice \nto factor these topics into the objectives and \npriorities of their net-zero transition plans.\nCONTENTS  |  FINANCIAL INSTITUTION NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLANS — FUNDAMENTALS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND GUIDANCE\n34\nAn institution should also articulate whether and \nhow it intends to use carbon credits.
