Then in \n2024–25 we aim to roll our customised \ndecarbonising benchmarks across our listed equity \nand credit portfolio, starting with c.£40 billion UK \nand US equity portfolio. \nWe describe each of these actions in more detail \nin figure 17 on the next page, as well as explaining \nthe role of our exclusions policy. Then on page 32, \nwe set out a directional roadmap for decarbonising \nour overall investments portfolio by asset class.\nEnsuring our actions are in our customers’ \nfinancial interests \nCustomised decarbonising benchmarks will \nreduce the carbon intensity of our investment \nportfolio, which we believe will make it more \nresilient over the long term. It is critical that any \nchanges to benchmarks are well tested and \nmanaged so that we can continue to protect \ncustomers’ financial outcomes.

To make sure our \nexisting customers could also benefit from this, \nin 2022 we moved c.1.5 million customers and \nc.£15 billion of assets from our existing default \noptions to ones that reflect the same thinking \nand outcomes-based approach as our new \ndefault option. \n \nThe Sustainable Multi Asset Universal Strategic \nLifestyle Profile applies an ESG approach to all \nequity and listed real estate (‘REIT’) components. \nThe equity exposure in the solution (£12 billion \nAUA) tracks sustainable indices that combine \nexclusions, tilts and stewardship activity.
