We will seek to replicate, as far as \npracticable, the potential value and time horizon of such \nremuneration, as well as performance conditions that \nmay apply. \nIn some circumstances, it may also be necessary to set \nup additional or alternative arrangements, including \nbut not limited to: \n▪ Relocation-related expenses \n▪ International assignment allowances and expenses. \nIn the case of internal promotions, any commitments \nmade before appointment may be honoured unless \nan alternative approach, more closely aligned with \nthe prevailing policy, is agreed by the Committee. \nAny special joining arrangements may include malus \nand/or clawback; for example, tied to leaving within \na predefined period. \nDifferences between the remuneration \npolicies for Executive Directors and \nother employees \nThe Remuneration Policy for the Executive Directors is \ndesigned to be broadly similar to the policy applicable \nto Bupa employees to ensure that they are both aligned \nPolicy Committee response \nNotice period and \ncompensation for \nloss of office in \nservice contracts \n▪ \n▪ \n12 months’ notice from the Company to the Executive Director. \nUp to 12 months’ base salary (in line with the notice period). Notice period payments will \neither be made as normal (if the Executive Director continues to work during the notice \nperiod or is on ‘gardening leave’) or at the termination date for any unexpired notice period. \nTreatment of MBS \non loss of office \nunder plan rules \n▪ The Committee may make an MBS payment for the year of cessation depending on the \nreason for leaving. Typically, the Committee will take into consideration the period served \nduring the year and the individual’s performance up to cessation. Any such payment is at \nthe discretion of the Committee. \n▪ Any MBS will be paid at the normal time following the end of the performance year. \nTreatment of SPP \non loss of office \nunder plan rules \n▪ An Executive Director’s award will vest in accordance with the terms of the plan and \nsatisfaction of performance conditions measured at the normal completion of the \nperformance period if the reason for leaving is redundancy, pre-agreed retirement, early \nretirement on the grounds of ill health, death or any other special circumstance agreed by \nthe Committee. In these cases, final awards may be pro-rated based on completed months \nof service. The period of active employment excludes any period of ‘gardening leave’ or other \nsuch period when the Executive Director was legally employed but not required to actively \ncarry out their duties. For any other reason, they will not be eligible for an SPP payment. \n▪ Any SPP payment will be paid at the normal time, e.g. following the end of the performance \nperiod, or two years later for any deferral. \nwith delivering sustainable business performance. \nAlthough the size of the opportunity varies, the \nunderlying principles of the salary review cycle, \nMBS and SPP are the same for the senior \nexecutive population. \nA small number of senior executives across Bupa \nparticipate in the SPP, based on the same framework \nas the Executive Directors, with award levels calculated \nas a percentage of salary based on their level of \nseniority and accountability. Vesting of the awards is \ndependent on performance against specific financial \nand non-financial measures over a three-year \nperformance period. \nPolicy on payments for loss of office \nThe table summarises the key elements of our policy \non payment for loss of office in compliance with the \nrelevant plan rules and local employment legislation. \nAny payments made due to loss of office may take \ninto account malus or clawback provisions as set out \non page 93. \nService contracts for Executive Directors \nExecutive Directors have a 12-month rolling \nemployment contract. The notice requirement is 12 \nmonths from both the Company and the individual, \nwhich may be payable in lieu. These contracts also \ninclude specific post-termination restrictions. Executive \nDirectors are usually permitted, subject to the Board’s \napproval, to have one external NED role and to accept \nand retain the fee for this appointment. This is on the \ncondition that any external appointment does not give \nrise to a conflict of interest. \nBupa Annual Report 2022 95 \n    \n     \n                   \n                  \n                 \n        \n      \n     \n   \n     \n  \n          \n          \n          \n       \n          \n        \n  \n     \n  \n           \n \n     \n   \n  \n           \n          \n        \n         \n        \n           \n        \n          \n        \n     \n          \n  \n   \n   \nStrategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements \nDirectors’ remuneration report \nPart 3: Policy continued \nRemuneration Policy table – NEDs \nTerms of engagement for NEDs \nThe terms of engagement for the Non-Executive Directors (NEDs) of Bupa set out the fees and benefits to which \nthey are entitled as well as\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BUPA<|><organization<|>Bupa is a healthcare company that provides health insurance, medical services, and related healthcare products.
