Within \nthese documents can be found directives for preventing \nand reducing accidents, incidents and losses, as well as \nthe responsibilities regarding the management of the \nrisks relating to human, equity, production, environmen-\ntal and community preservation We have implemented \nindicators, work committees and procedures designed to \ninvestigate, mitigate and prevent accidents, as well as to \nengage employees on the matter , all of which are con-\nsidered material by our stakeholders, who stressed their \nconcern over the issue during the most recent materiality \nprocess. \nAlso forming part of this management system are: the \n‘Risk Management Program’ (RMP), developed in ac-\ncordance with international standards (ISO 31000); the \n‘Occupational Risk Management Program’ (ORMP); the \n‘Occupational Health Medical Control Program’ (PCMSO); \nthe ‘Hearing Protection Program’ (HPP); the ‘Ergonomics \nProgram’ (EP); the ‘Respiratory Protection Program’ (RPP); \nthe ‘Management of Information on Legal Requirements’, \nand other routines and tools, such as the Mapping of Job \nRisks, the results of which are discussed every month by \nthe Health and Safety Committees forming part of the \nsenior management and technical areas, meaning we can \nmonitor not only the end-indicators, but also the mid-indi-\ncators during each stage of evolution.\nOur work aimed at lowering the accident frequency rates \nis ongoing, as is that aimed at reducing the exposure to \nserious risks and events such as accidents involving time \noff work and fatalities. In this area, our technical team can \ncount upon support from a specialist consultancy. We are \nnow in a significantly more improved position than we \nwere six years ago, within the positive benchmark rates \nfor the frozen foods sector , but we are continuing to work \ntowards achieving a frequency rate of 4%, in line with the \ninternational benchmark for segments such as that of \nconsumer goods.\nAt BRF, our employees and service providers directly \nlinked to the business are covered by the OHS manage-\nment system at at least one level, even when their work \nlocations are not controlled by the Company. Our suppli-\ners are ratified in accordance with corporate norms which \nanalyze their reputations and compliance with labor leg-\nislation, whilst our agreements with them contain clauses \nrelated to maintenance of the health and safety of the \nworkers. Furthermore, in the Commercial area, part of the \nroutine of our sales consultants involves using the BRF \nConnect app to report any situations to their managers \nthat they may observe when visiting their clients’ premises \n- ice accumulating on the floors of cold storage spaces or \nunsafe practices, for example. By doing so, the manager \nreceiving the inputs can contact the client to address the \nissues.\nUpon joining the Company, our employees are provided \nwith guidance on the requirement to report any critical \naccidents, incidents or irregularities that they may wit-\nness, as well as inform their immediate supervisor or \nInternal Occupational Accident Prevention Commission \n(‘CIPA’) of any irregularities identified, whilst they also have \nthe right to suggest improvements. The CIPA is composed \nof elected employees and recommended individuals who \nparticipate in strategic monthly meetings with senior \nmanagement to better understand the risks and adopt \ncontrol measures and means of preventing accidents and \nincidents. The group has full autonomy to suggest im-\nprovements and intervene in processes when any sort of \nrisk is identified. \nFinally, we also have an Observation and Prevention \nProgram, this being a tool to assist those employees \nwho observe any sort of irregularity or unsafe behavior \nin approaching their colleague in a friendly manner , thus \navoiding problems or reprisals and allowing for mutual \ncare and continuous learning.\nThrough the offering of forums and meetings, every new \nemployee is presented with the Health and Safety Policy \nand the Company’s Golden Rules. They are also instructed \non the use, storage and maintenance of PPE (Personal \nProtective Equipment) and observation of the Emergen-\ncy Response Plan (ERP). At the beginning of 2023, the \nGolden Rules were reviewed and simplified with the aim \nof facilitating their understanding and adoption in the \nday-to-day activities of our employees.\nThe employees working with special or high equipment \nor activities receive specific training in accordance with \nthe relevant Regulatory Norms (RNs) and BRF’s internal \ndirectives. \n70\nOur strategy\nCulture and \nEngagement\nValue Generation\nIndicators  \nand annex\n3\n4\n5\n6\nOur way of  \ndoing\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BRF DIGITAL ACADEMY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The BRF Digital Academy was created in 2018 to provide mandatory and institutional training to all employees, involving 100% of staff in 2022, with over 2,600 courses accessed via various devices, aiming to enhance skills related to sustainability, ethics, conduct, diversity, and equality.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>BRF<|>ORGANIZATION<|>BRF is a company that operates in the food sector, implementing health, safety, and sustainability initiatives, including the BRF Digital Academy and comprehensive occupational health and safety management systems.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>2022<|>EVENT<|>The year 2022 marked a milestone for BRF, with full employee participation in training programs and ongoing safety and sustainability efforts.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>ISO 31000<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ISO 31000 is an international standard for risk management, which BRF’s Risk Management Program (RMP) aligns with to ensure safety and risk mitigation.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>CIPA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Internal Occupational Accident Prevention Commission (CIPA) is composed of elected employees and management representatives, participating in strategic meetings to identify risks and suggest safety improvements.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Health and Safety Policy<|>ORGANIZATION<|>BRF’s Health and Safety Policy establishes guidelines and rules for employee safety, including PPE use, emergency procedures, and safety training.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Golden Rules<|>ORGANIZATION<|>BRF’s Golden Rules are simplified safety guidelines provided to employees to promote understanding and adherence to safety practices in daily activities.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Employees<|>PERSON<|>BRF employees are trained on health and safety policies, encouraged to report irregularities, and participate in safety programs to promote a safe working environment.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Suppliers<|>ORGANIZATION<|>BRF’s suppliers are evaluated for reputation and compliance with labor laws, with agreements containing clauses to maintain workers’ health and safety.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>BRF Connect app<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The BRF Connect app is used by sales consultants to report unsafe practices or hazards observed during client visits, facilitating prompt corrective actions.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Health and Safety Committees<|>ORGANIZATION<|>These committees, part of BRF’s management structure, meet monthly to monitor safety indicators, investigate incidents, and implement risk control measures.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Occupational Risk Management Program<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The ORMP is part of BRF’s safety system, developed according to international standards, aimed at identifying and mitigating workplace risks.)##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
