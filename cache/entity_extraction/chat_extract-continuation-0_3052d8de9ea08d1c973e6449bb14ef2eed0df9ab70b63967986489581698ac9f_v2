This includes daylight \nenergy saving lighting systems and timing clocks for \nexternal signage and marketing digital displays.\nBut our ambition is to do more. We will continue \nto improve our design practices and use only the \nmost sustainable suppliers and materials with an aim \nof achieving Gold SKA accreditation in early 2023.\n(1) The SKA assessment scheme assesses the environmental \nimpact of refurbishments and fitouts.\nSince 2020, we have  \nbeen on a journey to \nimprove and embed \nsustainable practices \nacross all our \nbranch locations. \nClimate transition plan: Case study\n52NatWest Group plc | 2022 Climate-related Disclosures Report\nGovernance Strategy and Climate transition plan Risk Management and Scenario Analysis Metrics and TargetsIntroduction\nHow we identify, assess, and manage \nclimate-related risk, including scenario analysis.\nIn this section\n4.1 How climate-related risks are integrated into NatWest Group’s \nrisk management processes\n4.2 Our processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risk\n4.2a Scenario analysis\n4.3 Managing our exposure to climate-related risk\n4\n Risk management \nand scenario \nanalysis\n53NatWest Group plc | 2022 Climate-related Disclosures Report\nGovernance Strategy and Climate transition plan Risk Management and Scenario Analysis Metrics and TargetsIntroduction\nNatWest Group’s pathway to integration of climate risk\nDuring 2022 we continued to mature the integration of climate-related risk \nwithin NatWest Group’s risk management processes. Climate risk was first \nincluded as a principal risk in the NatWest Group risk directory in early 2021 \nalongside an iterative multi-year approach for full integration. The timing of this \nmulti-year journey reflects both the complexity of the task and evolving nature \nof climate data capabilities and supporting tooling.\nIn 2021, we achieved the first-generation implementation of climate risk \nmaturity through application of predominantly qualitative approaches, \nconcentrated within priority sectors or customers.\nIn 2022, we enhanced our level of maturity through:\n • an increase in the application of quantitative analysis;\n • increased utilisation of data within decision-making, risk monitoring and  \nrisk reporting; and\n • extending the scope of application, resulting in limited gaps in coverage, \nacross heightened climate-related risk sectors and the customers within.\nExamples of 2022 enhancements include:\n • Increased application of quantitative climate scenario analysis, used to \nidentify and assess potential climate-related risk impacts upon market risk, \npension risk and conduct risk.\n • Utilisation and further development of a suite of key risk indicators, with \ntransition underway to operational limits, which have been developed to \ndetermine the boundaries that would result in potential risk exposure \noutside thresholds, and used to inform climate risk reporting.\n • Enhancements to risk appetite measures used for monitoring and reporting \nto Board Risk Committee. New measures were developed in 2022 to \nprovide a focus on monitoring progress towards decarbonisation, both for \nfinancing activities and our own operations. These are intended to reflect \nthe correlation with climate-related risk exposure and a deviation from \nintended transition pathways.\nHow climate-related risks are \nintegrated into NatWest Group’s risk \nmanagement processes\nThe image below represents our journey to fully embedding climate risk management within business activities and processes, \nincluding target state and ongoing progress.\nFull  \nIntegration\nSystematic application of \nadvanced climate analytics, \ninforming risk assessments and \nscenario analysis\nSystematic updates to \nquantified climate-related \nrisk
