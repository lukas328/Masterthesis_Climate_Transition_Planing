We have many clients who, despite acknowledging climate change countermeasures \nbeing an operational challenge that needs to be faced, are unsure about setting targets and worried about what action \nto take. For this reason, Mizuho is enhancing our middle market firm and SME -oriented sustainability-related financing \nand consulting support, with engagement as a starting point. \n \nWe provide solutions through both financial and non-financial services. Specifically, we have approximately 2,000 \nrelationship managers who have gained internal qualifications related to SDGs. Through conversing with clients and \nusing simple diagnostic tools, we are provi ding support free of charge to clients who are clarify ing the purposes and \nchallenges of SDG -related initiatives, setting target s, and planning measures. Along with this, we are also providing \nfinancing such as SDG initiative support loans and private placement bonds for clients who have announced targets for \nSDG-related initiatives. Also, we are supporting middle market firms and SMEs in their efforts to design climate change \ncountermeasures with our  Mizuho Sustainability -Linked Loan Pro product.
