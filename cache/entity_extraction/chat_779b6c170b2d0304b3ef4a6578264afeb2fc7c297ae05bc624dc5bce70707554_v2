This permits insurance premium rate revisions to respond quickly to changes in customer risk \nprofiles, claims experience and market considerations. \nThe ability to review premium rates is a significant mitigant to pricing risk. The Group does not underwrite a \nsignificant amount of general insurance business that commits it to cover risks at premiums fixed beyond a \n12-month period from inception or renewal. \nBupa Annual Report 2022 184 \n \n                     \n                \n                \n             \n           \n                 \n                \n              \n              \n                \n              \n                \n         \n \n                   \n               \n                 \n            \n                \n            \n                   \n                     \n       \n                \n               \n                   \n                    \n                 \n                  \n  \n       \n                 \n                 \n                 \n           \n                \n        \n                    \n                \n                 \n                 \n              \n     \n           \n              \n   \n                   \n                  \n                \n               \n             \n \n                   \n                   \n                   \n             \n     \n          \n      \n   \nStrategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements \nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \ncontinued \nClaims risk \nClaims risk is the risk of claims exceeding the amounts assumed in the premium rates. This can be driven by an \nadverse fluctuation in the amount and incidence of claims incurred and external factors such as medical inflation. \nClaims risk is managed and controlled by means of pre-authorisation of claims, outpatient benefit limits, the use \nof consultant networks and agreed networks of hospitals and charges. Specific claims management processes \nvary across the Group depending on local requirements, market environment and practice. \nAdverse claims experience, for example, which is caused by external factors such as medical inflation, will affect \ncash flows after the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Recent adverse claims experience is reflected \nin these Consolidated Financial Statements in claims paid and movements in the provisions for claims. \nGenerally, the Group’s health insurance contracts provide for the reimbursement of incurred medical expenses, \ntypically in-hospital for treatment related to acute, rather than chronic, medical conditions. The contracts do not \nprovide for capital sums or indemnified amounts. Therefore, claims experience is underpinned by prevailing rates \nof illness events giving rise to hospitalisations. Claims risk is generally mitigated by having processes to ensure \nthat both the treatments and the resulting reimbursements are appropriate. \n(ii) Reserving risk \nReserving risk is the risk that provisions made for claims prove to be insufficient in light of later events and \nclaims experience. There is a relatively low exposure to reserving risk compared with underwriting risk due \nto the very short-term nature of the claims development patterns. The short-term nature of the Group’s general \ninsurance contracts means that movements in claims development assumptions are generally not significant. \nThe development claims settlement patterns are kept under constant review to maintain the validity of the \nassumptions and, hence, the validity of the estimation of recognised general insurance liabilities. \nThe amount of claims provision at any given time that relates to potential claims payments that have not been \nresolved within one year is around 5% in the context of the Group. The small provisions that relate to longer than \none year can be calculated with reasonable confidence. \nIn the early stages of the pandemic, government restrictions across many of our markets affected insurance \ncustomers’ ability to access treatment in private healthcare facilities and make claims, particularly for elective \nprocedures. A proportion of the resultant shortfall in claims is expected to rebound over time and this could result \nin the cost of claims increasing in the long run, due to the deferred costs of treating undiagnosed or under-treated \nillnesses. The Group has established reserves for the deferred claims where a constructive obligation exists. As with \nany reserve of this nature, there is inherent uncertainty in the key judgements, including claims inflation, which may \nimpact future results. \n(iii) Other risks related to underwriting health insurance business \nClaims provisions are not discounted and their short-term nature means that changes in interest rates have no \nimpact on reserving risk. In addition, the future premium income and claims outflows of health insurance premium \nliabilities are largely unaffected by changes in interest rates. However, changes to inflationary factors such as wage \ninflation and medical cost inflation affect the value of future claims outflows. \nNone of the Group’s general insurance contracts contain embedded derivatives, so there are no additional financial \nrisks, including interest rate risk, arising from the contracts. \nThe Group is exposed to foreign currency risk through some of the insurance liabilities which are settled in a local \ncurrency. Where possible, these liabilities are matched to assets in the relevant currency to hedge this exposure. \nThe majority of the Group’s general insurance activities are single-line health portfolios. Even though only one line \nof business is involved, the Group does not have significant concentration of insurance risk for the following \nreasons: \n▪ Broad geographical diversity across several markets – across the UK, Spain, Australia, Latin America, Türkiye, \nthe Middle East and Hong Kong. \n▪ Product diversity between domestic and expatriate, and individual and corporate health insurance. \n▪ A variety of claims type exposures across diverse medical providers: consultants, clinics, individual hospitals \nand hospital groups. \nThe Group as a whole, and its principal general insurance entities, are well diversified in respect of insurance risk. \nOnly in selected circumstances does the Group use reinsurance. The reinsurance used does not give rise to a \nmaterial counterparty default credit risk exposure for the Group. Restrictions are in place on the credit quality \nand amount of reinsurance ceded to individual counterparties. In most jurisdictions, Bupa has established fee \nagreements with healthcare provider groups to limit the impact of unexpected claims cost inflation. \n(iv) Catastrophe risk \nA natural disaster or a\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
