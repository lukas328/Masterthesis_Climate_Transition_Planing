This allows for portfolio growth in \nenergy efficient, Scope 1 and 2 companies \nas there is insufficient data available to \nmeasure Scope 3 emissions in the portfolio.\nIn the case of Eurozone sovereign fixed \nincome, a qualitative indicator has been \nchosen, as recommended by PAII in the \nabsence of methodologies for assigning \nemissions to sovereign fixed income. It is \nused the Climate Change Performance \nIndex (CCPI), which evaluates a country’s \nprogress in the fight against climate \nchange based on the evolution of per capita \nemissions, energy efficiency indicators and \nclimate change policies.\nAs a reference scenario in the emissions \nreduction pathway, it is used the IEA Net \nZero 2050 scenario, which is one of the \nmost widely used in the financial industry \nand consistent with those used by the BBVA \nGroup to set its decarbonization targets.\nThe Paris Aligned Investor Initiative (PAII), \nNet Zero Investment Framework has been \nselected as the target setting framework, \nrecommended by the Net Zero Asset \nManagers initiative, among the most widely \nused by asset managers and with the \ngreatest methodological coverage by asset \ntype. Under this framework, a portfolio \nalignment target and emission reduction \ntargets by asset type should be established.\nIn the portfolio alignment goal, assets that \nhave reached Net Zero, are aligned with Net \nZero or are in the process of alignment with \nNet Zero are included.\nP.  81\nBBVA Report on TCFD 2022\nThis English version is a translation of the original in Spanish for information purposes only.
