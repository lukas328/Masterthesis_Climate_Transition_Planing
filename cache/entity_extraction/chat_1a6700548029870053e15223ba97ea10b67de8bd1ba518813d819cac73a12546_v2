As a global business with a large supplier base, 96% of \nour market-based emissions arise from our supply chain, meaning businesses \nwhose services we utilise are responsible for more than 550,000 tonnes \nof CO2e a year. It’s essential we account for and reduce these emissions in \npartnership with our suppliers to support the global net zero ambition.\nWhat?\nWe will work with our suppliers to aim for 67% of our suppliers (by emissions) \nto set science-based targets to reduce emissions by 2026.\nHow?\nWe have a large supplier base, with around 7,000 individual suppliers in 2021. \nEmissions resulting from LSEG’s purchased goods and services are part of our \nscope 3 emissions, the largest portion of our total reported emissions. \nSuppliers contributing the greatest share of these emissions are those \ninvolved in IT and professional services, with approximately 166 suppliers \nresponsible for 70% of our supplier emissions in 2021.\nThrough a robust engagement plan we will work with our suppliers to \nunderstand their challenges, track data and encourage action. \nWorking with our supply chain to \nreduce emissions \nLSEG CLIMATE TRANSITION PLAN 202225\nCONTENTS\nFigure 4: Our suppliers with emissions science-based targets in place Through a robust \nengagement plan we will \nwork with our suppliers \nto understand their \nchallenges, track data and \nencourage action. \nSuppliers with science-based \nemissions targets in place\n2021\n17%\n2026\n67%\nCONTENTS\nLSEG CLIMATE TRANSITION PLAN 202226\nWhy?\nSourcing electricity from renewable sources will not only lower our \nscope 2 market-based emissions but will support the increased market \ndemand for low-carbon electricity. For a location portfolio of our size \nand scale we are looking at this holistically across our business.  \nFirstly, our priority is to reduce our scope 2 emissions and secondly,  \nwe will ensure any residual emissions will be from a renewable source.\nWhat?\nWe will ensure 100% of the electricity we consume is from renewable \nsources by increasing green tariffs across our portfolio, exploring on-\nsite generation, and purchasing Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs) \nwhere those options aren’t currently available.\nHow?\nSourcing 100% of our electricity from renewable sources depends on \navailability of green tariffs in the different regions where we operate. \nWhere green tariffs are available, and we have control over the energy \nsupply we are seeking to switch to renewable electricity sources. \nWhere green tariffs are not available we are purchasing credible \nand traceable Energy Attribute Certificates which are market-based \ninstruments that are created when 1 megawatt hour of electricity is \ngenerated from renewable sources. \nOur long-term approach is to determine the feasibility to invest  \nin Virtual Power Purchase Agreements (VPPA).\nThe key steps we are taking to shift to renewable electricity  \nsources include:\n – Identify credible and strategic options for purchasing  \nrenewable energy\n – Identify strategic locations for transition to green tariffs\n – Implement guidance for sites and procurements\n – Determine opportunities for on-site generation\n – Review longer term options for renewable energy purchasing\nIncreasing renewable electricity \nacross our portfolio\nFigure 5: Buildings on renewable tariff \n% of electricity consumption  \n2021\n11%\n2026\nXX%\nCONTENTS\nWhy?\nAlongside a robust emissions reduction plan across our locations, our \noperations, technology and travel, we will also incorporate credible offsets to \nneutralise and remove residual emissions. We know that a reliance on offsets, \nhowever credible is not a satisfactory end solution. However, used as part of \na robust strategy where reductions are the key objective, then it is a valuable \nand impactful tool to support climate projects close to our global operations.\nWhat? \nFor emissions that we cannot eliminate we will support nature-based solutions \nthat have socioeconomic benefits and receive carbon neutral certification.\nHow?\nFrom 2021 we have offset our emissions from scope 1, scope 2 and scope 3 \n(business travel).\nThis is being done in partnership with Natural Capital Partners, an external  \nnature-based solutions consultant and focuses on sourcing offsets which \nachieve the following: \n – Credible: robust approach which aligns with the CarbonNeutral® Protocol \n – Alignment with best practice: supports our business rationale, is transparent \nand reduces reputational risk\n – Positively impacts our locations and communities: solutions that are \nconsiderate of the impacts in the communities and locations we operate, \nensuring that those most impacted by climate change on the ground see \nthe benefits\n – Demonstrate leadership: underpin a robust and deliberate approach\nNeutralising and removing residual emissions\nLSEG CLIMATE TRANSITION PLAN 202227\nLSEG CLIMATE TRANSITION PLAN 202228\nCONTENTS\nProjects supported through offsets in 2021\nProject Standards What?
