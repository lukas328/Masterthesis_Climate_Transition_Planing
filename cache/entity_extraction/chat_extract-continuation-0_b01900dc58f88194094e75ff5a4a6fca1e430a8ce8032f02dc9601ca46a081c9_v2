In other \nwords, it is made up principally of proteins and fats as well \nas by the biodegradable detergents used in the sanitation \nprocess. The Company treats 100% of this waste and \nconstantly monitors the quality of the rivers from which \nit collects its water and into which it releases the waste \nfollowing treatment. As such, BRF can operate more \nproactively in the mitigation of possible environmental \nimpacts and in the promotion of a harmonious interaction \nwith the environment.\nWe also have a corporate directive that is applicable \nto our industrial and farming activities, which aims to \nstandardize the indicators as well as the frequency in \nmonitoring and compliance of the discharge of waste.\nIn 2022, BRF invested R$ 73.7 million to guarantee the \nefficiency of its water and waste treatment stations. \nFurthermore, around R$ 2 million was invested in \nthe acquisition of laboratory equipment used in the \nmanagement and control of its processes, thus ensuring \nthe efficiency of its treatment stations. In 2022, BRF \nachieved 99% efficiency in its waste treatment stations, \nwhich was verified by external laboratories and certified \nby Inmetro. Specifically for the Biochemical Oxygen \nDemand (BOD) indicator , which measures the biode-\ngradable polluting load of the waste, a removal ratio of \n99% was recorded. \n \nNeither were there any incidents related to non-com-\npliance with water-quality licenses, norms, or regulations \nduring the reporting period.\nForest management GRI 304-1\nWe have forest assets destined for the production of \nbiomass as an energy source, totaling 28,000 hectares \ndistributed across 8 Brazilian states and 189 farms \n(99 are our own and 90 leased). Species belonging to \nthe eucalyptus genus make up 88.33% of this area, \nwhile 1.23% is covered by pine an 0.34% by other tree \ngenus (such as araucária, bamboo and mimosa). The \nremaining 10.1% is open area that is awaiting the next \nplanting cycle.\nOf our own farms, two are within a Conservation Unit \n(the Escarpa Devoniana State EPA) and 41 contain up \nto 10km of land classified as a conservation unit. The \nsurvey of the proximity between these farms and the \nPriority Areas for Conservation of the Biodiversity was \nundertaken in accordance with the methodology set \nforth by CONABIO Resolution nº 39 dated 12/14/2005. \nUltimately, we obtained the results set out in the \nfollowing table:\n7 units are at a distance of up to 10 km \nfrom a priority area for conservation with a \nhigh level of biological importance;\n44 units are at a distance of up to 10 km \nfrom a priority area for conservation with a \nvery high level of biological importance;\n21 units are at a distance of up to 10 \nkm from a priority area for conservation \nwith an extremely high level of biological \nimport\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BRF<|><organization<|>BRF is a company involved in water management, waste treatment, and forest management, operating in various regions including Brazil, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates.
