For our initial baseline and target, we \nconsidered  North American clients given the regional variation of data quality. The PCAF Commercial Real \nEstate asset class methodology includes on-balance sheet loans specifically for the purchase and refinance \nof commercial real estate and investments in the same. In alignment with the PCAF Standard, our baseline \nemissions are comprised of a building’s operational emissions, or Scope 1 and 2. We have included three \nloan portfolios for the baseline emissions and annual absolute emissions disclosure for this sector — Citi \nCommunity Capital (CCC), Global Wealth and Markets. However , we decided to not include CCC in our target \nsetting process, so as to avoid any unintended incentives to reduce lending in this area. \nIn calculating our baseline, we have relied on publicly available data through CRREM, the EIA Commercial \nBuilding Energy Consumption Survey (CBES), Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS), and the \nEPA. These data sources, while regionally specific, still create a highly estimated data quality emissions \nfootprint. We are continuing to develop strategies for ensuring that we have the sufficient quantity and \nquality of data, as measured against the PCAF data score hierarchy. This year , our PCAF data quality \nscore for the CRE sector was 4.4 (out of 5), indicating the high degree of estimation used to calculate this \nfootprint. Unlike other sectors, where we can rely on corporate emissions reporting to bolster our data \nquality, building-specific data (such as metered energy use and calculated emissions) are not as readily \nreported and in a consistent manner across regions. Therefore, improving the data quality of the CRE \nsector calculations will require a unique engagement approach that occurs in a different context than that \nof our corporate clients. As we refine the data in the coming years, we will continue to assess appropriate \ntarget pathways for the portfolio. \nFor the CRE sector , we have set an intensity target, highlighting the projected sectoral growth decoupled \nfrom GHG emissions, and acknowledge that decarbonization of the CRE sector will largely rely on the \ndecarbonization of the Power sector (a primary source of building emissions is purchased electricity). We \nhave benchmarked against the U.S. CRREM scenarios for property types relevant to the current portfolio.\nNext Steps  \nWe recognize that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to achieving 1.5°C-aligned targets across sectors. \nAs illustrated in the Achieving 2030 Targets graphic on page 25, there are a variety of levers that we \nexpect to be needed to achieve our targets. Client engagement remains the priority, and as we proceed \nwith our client reviews, we will look to identify and communicate expectations we see for our clients.\nOur baseline emissions calculations and sector target setting will continue to evolve as we expect our \naccess to quality data to increase. We plan to continue progressing through our Net Zero Plan for the \nAuto Manufacturing, Commercial Real Estate, Steel and Thermal Coal Mining sectors; notably, developing \nstrategies to achieve our targets and beginning reporting and verification of our progress. In 2023-2024, \nwe intend to assess the materiality to calculate baselines and set targets for our remaining sectors, \nincluding Agriculture6, Aluminum, Aviation, Cement, and Shipping.\n6 Assessment of the Agriculture sector will take into account the impact of food security considerations as well as social impacts. \n24 | TCFD REPORT 2022: CITI’S APPROACH TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND NET ZERO\n \nNet Zero Plan – Energy and Power Update  \nThe first step in the implementation of our Net Zero Plan for the Energy and Power sectors has been to \nincrease engagement with our clients to better understand their emissions profile and transition plans, a \nprocess that we anticipate will continue through the end of 2023. Last year , we began extensive efforts to \nreview our Energy and Power client base, collect available emissions data, establish a baseline for financed \nemissions for these two sectors and set a series of goals to reduce our financed emissions footprint by \n2030. Our initial focus consists of engaging with our clients across a broad range of key considerations \nincluding: GHG emissions (as disclosed or via third-party estimations where not disclosed), GHG emissions \nreduction targets, climate risk scoring, decarbonization/transition plans and other considerations.\nEmissions Data Lag  \nThe quality and availability of climate-related data continues to be a significant challenge. At the \ntime of the analysis disclosed in this report, the data available for calculating financed emissions \nand emissions intensity and measuring progress was nearly two years old, given the availability \nof the data at the time.
