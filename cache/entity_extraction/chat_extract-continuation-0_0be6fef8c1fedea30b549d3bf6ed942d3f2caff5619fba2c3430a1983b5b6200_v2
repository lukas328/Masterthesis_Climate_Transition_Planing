As well \nas the commitment to becoming Net Zero by 2040, we \nhave targets relating to energy consumption using clean \nsources and a reduction in our use of water and we have \nmade significant advances in our means of control to \nensure the traceability of grains originating from the Am-\nazon and Cerrado regions, as we aim to establish a chain \nthat is free from deforestation and with a low impact on \nbiodiversity. Using geospatial technology and data sci-\nence with investment of approximately R$ 618,000 per \nyear .\nWhat opportunities exist?  \nOur operations depend upon the use of energy sources. \nAs such, we have started to invest in the construction of \nour own clean source energy production plants. As well as \nensuring the provision of energy for our units and miti-\ngating the emission of greenhouse gases, these invest-\nments bring economic opportunities by offering compet-\nitive production values and potential cost reductions over \nthe next 15 years.   \nEnvironmental compliance and access \nto water and energy resources\nAffected capital:  \nNatural capital\nWhat is the risk?  \nJust as a lack of water affects any human activity, in the \ncase of BRF, the impact of water shortages can be signifi-\ncantly felt throughout its production chain, especially in \nrelation to the irrigation of grains for the production of \nanimal feed, providing water for animal consumption or \nour productive processes.\nHow do we manage this? Within our system of envi-\nronmental management, we have established a series \nof guidelines for gauging the water vulnerability of our \nplants, monitoring our consumption to be able to ration \nthe use of water in our processes, and implementing \ncorrective actions and contingency plans for when this \nrisk arises. We also have plans in place to prioritize invest-\nments in the transportation of water to our productive \nunits, as a means of increasing the capillarity of our me-\ntering and for the reuse and recycling of this resource. \nWhat opportunities exist? Our opportunity drivers \ninvolve the evolution and ongoing improvement of our \nwater management, thereby boosting the potential for \nwater recycling and reuse, increasing the capillarity of our \nmetering, eliminating waste and finding technologies that \nstreamline the use of water in our operations. Net Zero\nby 2040\nis the commitment that \nBRF has made, our biggest \ncontribution to combating \nclimate change.\n2022 Integrated  \nReport\nOur way of  \ndoing business\nOur strategy\nCulture and \nEngagement\nValue Generation\nIndicators  \nand annex\n3\n4\n5\n6\n2\nPresentation1\n31\nTrade barriers and market \nprotections SASB FB-MP-250a.4\nAffected capital:  \nFinancial capital\nWhat is the risk?  \nMore rigorous commercial barriers in our leading export \nmarkets can negatively affect our operational results.\nHow do we manage this?  \nSome countries, such as Russia and South Africa, have a \nhistory of imposing trade barriers on the importation of \nfood products. Furthermore, many developed countries \nuse direct and indirect subsidies to increase the compet-\nitive standing of their own producers in other markets. \nThe European Union, for example, has adopted a system \nof quotas for certain poultry products as a means of \nmitigating the effects Brazil’s lower production costs have \non European producers, whilst it has also been consid-\nering new regulations that could reduce the access that \ncertain products have to the market. Since 2017, the \nChinese government has been performing anti-dumping \ninvestigations in relation to Brazilian exports of whole \nchickens and chicken cuts, including our exports. Simi-\nlar moves have been implemented by the South African \ngovernment, but these have not involved investigations \ninto BRF, although they could result in new restrictive \nmeasures. The South African government decided to \nimpose a provisional tariff of 265% for companies which \ndo not request individual defense, as was our case. It is \nnot certain whether the local government will impose \nfurther restrictions on poultry and/or food commerce. \nThere have also been changes underway in Saudi Arabia, \none of our leading importers, which reduced the validity \nperiod for chicken from one year to 90 days, which they \ncommunicated to the World Trade Organization, although \nthe country closed the investigation in August 2021. To \ncircumvent these challenges, we paid close attention to \ninternational events concerning governments and au-\nthorities and sought to guarantee assertive planning of \nsupply, demand and production amongst BRF’s units both \nin Brazil and overseas. \nWhat opportunities exist?  \nWe have continued focusing on the evolution of our \nprocesses and on guaranteeing the confidence of the \nauthorities, as well as the certification of the plants and \nour active participation in trade agreements that contrib-\nute to BRF’s business and to the needs of the different \nmarkets. We continually monitor all the the markets in \nwhich we operate through consultants, local supervision, \nassociations and other mechanisms. Furthermore, we are \nstrengthening our processes relating to products with \nhigher aggregated value. \nData Protection and Cybersecurity \nGRI 3-3: Material topic (Ethics, integrity and compliance)\nAffected capitals: Intellectual capital and Social capital\nWhat is the\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BRAZIL<|><geo><|>Brazil is a country where the company operates, with regulations governing greenhouse gas emissions and energy policies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMAZON<|><geo><|>The Amazon region is a key area for grain origin, with efforts to establish a deforestation-free supply chain using geospatial technology)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CERRADO<|><geo><|>The Cerrado region is another important grain-producing area involved in the company's supply chain management)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BRF<|><organization><|>BRF is a company committed to sustainability, climate change mitigation, and environmental management, investing in clean energy and water recycling)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NET ZERO<|><event><|>BRF's commitment to achieving Net Zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040 as part of its climate change strategy)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GEOSPATIAL TECHNOLOGY<|><organization><|>Geospatial technology is used by BRF to trace grains and ensure supply chain sustainability)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DATA SCIENCE<|><organization><|>Data science is employed by BRF to analyze and improve environmental and operational processes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>R$ 618,000<|><organization><|>The annual investment BRF allocates towards geospatial technology and data science initiatives)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WATER<|><resource><|>Water is a critical resource for BRF's operations, with management plans to monitor and recycle water to mitigate shortages)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ENERGY<|><resource><|>Energy is essential for BRF's operations, with investments in clean energy production to reduce greenhouse gas emissions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NET ZERO<|><event><|>BRF's goal to reach Net Zero emissions by 2040, involving water and energy management strategies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRADE BARRIERS<|><event><|>Trade barriers and market protections pose risks to BRF's export activities, with measures like tariffs and quotas affecting market access)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINA<|><geo><|>China is a key market where anti-dumping investigations impact Brazilian poultry exports, including BRF's products)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOUTH AFRICA<|><geo><|>South Africa has imposed tariffs and restrictions on poultry imports, affecting BRF's market access)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAUDI ARABIA<|><geo><|>Saudi Arabia reduced the validity period for chicken imports, influencing BRF's export operations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRADE AGREEMENTS<|><organization><|>BRF actively participates in trade agreements to facilitate market access and mitigate trade risks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CYBERSECURITY<|><event><|>Data protection and cybersecurity are material topics for BRF, impacting its intellectual and social capital)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMAZON<|>BRF<|>BRF sources grains from the Amazon region, aiming for a deforestation-free supply chain<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CERRADO<|>BRF<|>BRF sources grains from the Cerrado region, with efforts to reduce environmental impact<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRF<|>NET ZERO<|>BRF<|>BRF has committed to achieving Net Zero emissions by 2040<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GEOSPATIAL TECHNOLOGY<|>BRF<|>BRF uses geospatial technology to trace grain origins and ensure supply chain sustainability<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DATA SCIENCE<|>BRF<|>BRF employs data science to analyze environmental and operational data<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>R$ 618,000<|>BRF<|>BRF invests annually in geospatial technology and data science<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WATER<|>BRF<|>Water management is critical for BRF's operations, with plans for monitoring, recycling, and contingency measures<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ENERGY<|>BRF<|>BRF invests in clean energy production to reduce greenhouse gases<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRADE BARRIERS<|>BRF<|>Trade barriers and tariffs threaten BRF's export markets, prompting strategic responses<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHINA<|>BRF<|>BRF's poultry exports are affected by anti-dumping investigations in China<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SOUTH AFRICA<|>BRF<|>South African tariffs and restrictions impact BRF's market access<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAUDI ARABIA<|>BRF<|>Changes in import validity periods in Saudi Arabia affect BRF's exports<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRADE AGREEMENTS<|>BRF<|>BRF participates in trade agreements to mitigate market access risks<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CYBERSECURITY<|>BRF<|>Cybersecurity and data protection are key to maintaining operational integrity and stakeholder trust<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
