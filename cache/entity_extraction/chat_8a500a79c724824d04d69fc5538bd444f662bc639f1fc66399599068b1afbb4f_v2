the allowance for known \ninflation when setting inflation assumptions; \nand, discount rates. Small changes in these \nassumptions can have a significant impact on \nthe defined benefit pension obligations and \nthe Company’s net pension surplus. \nFor the valuation of defined benefit pension \nobligations, we performed the following \nprocedures: \n▪ Assessed the qualifications and experience of \nthe external actuary to determine if they have \nthe knowledge and experience required to \nperform the valuation of the defined benefit \npension schemes; \n▪ Challenged the key assumptions, including \nthe mortality projection, inflation and discount \nrates. In critically assessing the key \nassumptions, we have utilised our own \npension valuation experts, and considered \nbenchmarking against available market \ndata; and \n▪ Assessed whether the disclosures in relation \nto the valuation of the defined benefit pension \nobligations are compliant with the relevant \nfinancial reporting requirements. \nBased on the procedures performed and the \nevidence obtained, we consider the valuation \nof the defined benefit pension obligations to \nbe appropriate. \nHow we tailored the audit scope \nWe tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we \nperformed enough work to be able to give an opinion \non the financial statements as a whole, taking into \naccount the structure of the Group and the Company, \nthe accounting processes and controls, and the industry \nin which they operate. \nFor the Group audit we defined a component as being \na single reporting pack within the Group’s consolidation \nprocess. Based on the output of our risk assessment, \nalong with our understanding of the Bupa Group \nstructure, we identified 22 components for which a \nfull scope audit of their financial information has been \nperformed. This was determined by assessing those \ncomponents considered to be financially significant \nand with reference to our risk assessment. \nWe identified a further 15 components where specific \naudit procedures were performed on certain balances \nand transactions to provide sufficient and appropriate \naudit coverage over individual financial statement \nline items. \nThe components where we performed audit procedures \nincluded some operating in each of the Group’s Market \nUnits and covered 89% of Group Revenue, 94% of \nGroup Loss before taxation expense and 85% of \nGroup Total assets. \nWe also performed audit procedures over the Group \nCentre functions, including the consolidation process \nand certain treasury and payroll processes. \nWe performed analytical review procedures over the \nremaining components. \nAs the Group audit team, we determined the level of \ninvolvement required at those components to be able \nto conclude whether sufficient and appropriate audit \nevidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion \non the consolidated financial statements as a whole.
