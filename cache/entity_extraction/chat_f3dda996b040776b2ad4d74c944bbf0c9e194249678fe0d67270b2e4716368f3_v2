In 2030, the restriction will be extended to \neconomic groups and companies that have any percentage \nof their revenue arising from thermal coal energy generation.\nIn the case of prospective economic groups, that is, potential \nclients, the beginning of a relationship will not be accepted \nwhen a dependence of revenue higher than 10% arising \nfrom thermal coal energy generation or from the installed \ncapacity higher than 1,000 MW is verified. \nAdditionally, the restrictions also apply to any assets, \neconomic groups and companies that are expanding their \nthermal coal energy generation activity. \nRestriction for coal mining and dedicated \ninfrastructure\nThe restrictions apply directly to mineral coal extraction \nassets (coal mining) and dedicated infrastructure and \nto economic groups and companies that have in 2023, \nmore than 15% of their revenue arising from coal mining \nor dedicated infrastructure or whose annual mineral coal \nextraction exceeds 10 million metric tons. In 2030, the \nrestrictions will be extended to economic groups and \ncompanies that have any percentage of their revenue arising \nfrom these activities, that is, the limit of annual mineral coal \nextraction will be zero. \nIn the case of prospective economic groups, that is, potential \nclients, the beginning of a relationship will not be accepted \nwhen a dependence of revenue higher than 10% arising from \ncoal mining or dedicated infrastructure or the annual mineral \ncoal extraction exceeds 10 million tons is verified.\nAdditionally, the restrictions also apply to any economic \ngroups and companies that are expanding their coal mining \nactivities or dedicated infrastructure, regardless of the share \nof their revenue.\nOperations that promote the managed \nphase-out of coal\nTo reduce HGH emissions and reach Net Zero in 2050, highly \ncarbon-intensive assets – such as the case of thermal \ncoal assets – must go through a transition to less carbon-\nintensive sources and may, in some cases, involve an early \nretirement process, that is, the end of the operation before \nreaching its useful life. Some of these assets may also be \nimpaired, whether due to change on the demand side or to \nregulations that change the scenario of operation of that \nasset as a result of the energy transition.\nIf, on one hand, the phase-out of coal operations is expected \nto increase the use of renewable types of energy, on the \nother hand, there may be undesired consequences if the \nassets are transferred to the control of agents with ESG \nand climate management capacity lower than the previous \nowners or who do not promote their decommissioning or \nthe transition to assets that are more in line with a Net Zero \nscenario.   More important than the transfer of ownership is \nto ensure that carbon-intensive assets go through a proper \ntransition or, when applicable, decommissioning, a process \nthat must be carried out on an orderly basis and in line with \nthe principles of a fair transition.\nAccordingly, we understand that the operations that promote \nthe phase-out of carbon-intensive assets may be important, \nprovided that it is associated with the engagement \nwith companies and the adoption of conditions that are \ncontractually defined that provide for the decommissioning \nof coal assets before 2030 and associated with the adoption \nof good environmental, social and climate practices. \nThe bank will finance and provide services to current \nand future clients in their initiatives that result in the \ndecarbonization of their head offices. The goal is never \nto not support any client but to support them in their \njourney to reduce emissions.\nFor the purpose of impacting the real economy and following \ngood international practices, at this time, the following \nare exceptions to the rule: (i) specific contracts of coal \nsupply to steel and iron plants; (ii) specific operations with \na contractually defined allocation of funds to promote \nthe energy transition, provided that the progress and \nachievement of the transition goals are verified; (iii) \noperations that help promote the managed phase-out of \nassets related to mineral coal provided that the criteria \nestablished by GFANZ are met.\nEngagement and transparency\nIn order to implement this measure, we will train our \nemployees and promote the engagement of the clients \nthat operate in the affected activities so as to promote \nthe transition to less carbon-intensive activities, in \nparticular to renewable\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
