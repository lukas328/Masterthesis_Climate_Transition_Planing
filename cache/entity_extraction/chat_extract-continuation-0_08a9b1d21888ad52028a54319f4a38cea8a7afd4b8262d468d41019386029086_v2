In 2022, the \nfirst climate stress test by the European \nCentral Bank and the first thematic review in \nrelation to the expectations of the European \nsupervisor took place. In addition to its own \nsupervisory activities, BBVA has actively \nparticipated in various working sessions, \nsharing its experiences with the European \nCentral Bank, the Bank of Spain, the Bank’s \nAssociation of T urkey and the Bank of \nMexico, among others.\nThirdly, and beyond the financial regulatory \nsphere, BBVA has continued to promote \ninitiatives to ask governments for more \nambitious action on climate change and \npublic policies. In this regard, it is worth \nnoting the calls to the G20 led by the WEF \nin Davos and at COP27 , as well as the letter \npromoted by We Mean Business Coalition \nand the Grupo Español de Crecimiento Verde \non REPowerEU. \nFinally, a fourth area of involvement with \ngovernments has to do with the promotion \nof sustainable finance in emerging countries. \nBBVA considers it a priority to close the \nlarge gap in sustainable financing in these \ncountries, without which it will not be \npossible to achieve zero net emissions.\nIn April 2022, within the framework of \nGFANZ, BBVA promoted the creation of \nthe Climate Finance Leadership Initiative \n(CFLI) in Colombia, which it currently chairs \ntogether with Bancolombia. The initiative \naims to catalyze sustainable financing in \nthe country by bringing together leading \ncompanies in the private sector and with the \nactive involvement of local government and \nthe support of multilateral entities.\nIn September 2022, BBVA was appointed \na member of the European High-Level \nExpert Group tasked with providing \nrecommendations to the European \nCommission to boost sustainable financing \nin emerging countries.\nP.  50\nBBVA Report on TCFD 2022\nThis English version is a translation of the original in Spanish for information purposes only.

Accordingly, in 2022 \nwork continued on the deployment of the \nsustainability data strategy, based on the \nPrinciples for effective risk data aggregation \nand risk BCBS 239, in which sustainability \ndata needs have been identified, data gaps \nhave been assessed and a conceptual \nmodel and implementation plan have been \ndeveloped. All this is geared to guaranteeing \na comprehensive vision of the Group’s \nclimate change risks to ensure their correct \ncontrol and management. In response to \nboth regulatory and management needs, \nand so on, the data considered include data \nrelated to customer climate scorings, real \nestate energy efficiency certificates, ESG \nratings, greenhouse gas emissions, asset \nand collateral location and sector-specific \nmetrics, etc.\nRisk\nAssessm ent\nFRAMEWORKS\nScenario \nAnalysis\nRISK MAPPING\nRISK \nMANAGEMENT\nRisk \nAppetite\nMonitoring \nand managementPricingCustomer\n Acceptance\nClimate change risk management in BBVA \nGroup is based on the risk planning process \nwhich is marked by the defined risk appetite \nand makes use of management frameworks \nwhich establish how these risks are to be \naddressed in day-to-day business activities.\nP.  52\nBBVA Report on TCFD 2022\nThis English version is a translation of the original in Spanish for information purposes only.
