The exercise demonstrated the \ncomplexity of defining what constitutes greenwashing \nand the importance of maintaining effective controls \nin an increasingly competitive market. NatWest Group \ncontinues to review current policies, processes, and \ncontrols to ensure the risk of greenwashing is \nadequately addressed in our frameworks.\nThe outcomes resulted in a potential financial impact of \nless than £70 million in the 1-in-25 year scenario and \nless than £315 million in the 1-in-100 year scenario.\nOperational Risk\nWe conducted operational risk scenarios in relation to \nphysical risk in 2020 and 2021.\nThe outcomes resulted in a potential financial impact \nof less than £1 million in the 1-in-25 year scenario and \nless than £20 million in the 1-in-100 year scenario.\nPension Risk\nIn 2022, we explored the resilience of our main defined \nbenefit pension scheme to climate-related risks, \nutilising the scenarios described on page 59. The \npension scheme was resilient to the scenarios as a \nresult of its strong funding position and limited \nexposure to high climate risk assets and geographies.\nIn addition, we are actively engaged with the Trustees \nof the pension scheme and their advisers, which \nprovides an understanding of their approach to \nmanaging the impact of climate change on NatWest \nGroup’s schemes. See the Trustee’s 2022 TCFD \nReport for further detail on the approach taken by the \nTrustee of NatWest Group’s largest scheme.\nMarket Risk\nClimate change has the potential to affect all market \nrisk factors that NatWest Group is exposed to. Climate \nregulatory guidance is in its infancy for traded market \nrisk. However, NatWest Group is enhancing its climate \nmarket risk framework and building climate into \nscenario analysis and risk appetite. In 2022 a \nfirst-generation short-term climate transition stress \ntest was developed.\nThe scenario assessed the impact of a disorderly \ntransition to a low-carbon economy on fair-valued \npositions. It explores hypothetical EU and UK \nregulation mandating firms to reduce carbon \nemissions across all scopes by 50% by 2030, with a \ngovernment carbon tax from 2025. These shocks are \napplied instantaneously across the issuer and \ncounterparty credit spread risks in the trading book. \nScenarios are expected to be refined further as \nimproved data becomes available.\nAs regulatory guidance develops, NatWest Group will \ncontinue to develop a range of key metrics and \ninternal reporting tools to assess and monitor \nclimate-related risks and opportunities.\nLiquidity Risk\nA climate-specific liquidity scenario was developed to \nassess the impact of an acute physical event on the \nliquidity position of NatWest Group.\nThe scenario focuses on a major flood-related event \nto the UK and Northern Europe with widespread \ndisruption and a temporary fall in economic output.\nThe disruption results in higher demand for cash \nfrom certain impacted business sectors due to the \nuncertainty. Volatility in financial markets impacts \nGBP, UK bonds and asset prices. Non-UK and \nEuropean depositors re-evaluate their exposure to the \nUK and European financial sector.\nManaging climate-related model risks\nClimate risk considerations have resulted in increased \nmateriality and complexity for models, with challenges \npresented by the availability of data and lack of \nbenchmarking options. A model risk review for \nsector-specific emission models was conducted in \n2022, in accordance with model risk policy \nrequirements. This included an assessment of \nmateriality and independent validation across various \nmodel dimensions.\nScenario Analysis continued\nClimate scenario analysis is already producing \nuseful insights to help identify and develop \nstrategies to manage the impacts from climate \nchange. However, NatWest Group recognises that \nclimate scenario analytics is a new specialism for \nthe industry. Analytics and integration with business \noperations is continuously improving on what is \na multi-year journey towards full maturity, with \nprioritisation on the most material risks and \nexposures relevant to NatWest Group. Regulatory \nexpectations continue to increase at pace, with a \nDear CEO Letter providing thematic feedback on \nthe PRA’s supervision of climate-related financial \nrisk and the CBES exercise, and a Dear CFO letter \ncovering impact assessment of climate risks on \nbalance sheet valuations in 2022.\nThe challenges and limitations, as noted within \nthis section and in previous disclosures remain \nprevalent to both NatWest Group and the wider \nindustry. NatWest Group is participating in a \nnumber of industry initiatives to contribute to \ncreating solutions to limitations through, for \nexample, participation in the Climate Financial \nRisk Forum (CFRF); Global Financial Markets \nAssociation climate data initiative; Bank of \nEngland conference on the treatment of climate \nrisk within the regulatory capital framework; \nand other climate risk initiatives\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NATWEST GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>NATWEST GROUP is a major UK-based banking and financial services organization actively involved in climate risk management, scenario analysis, and supporting customer transition to a low-carbon economy)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>2020<|>EVENT<|>The year when NATWEST GROUP set its climate ambition to support customer transition)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FEBRUARY 2023<|>EVENT<|>The date when NATWEST GROUP announced updates to its climate ambition)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>2021<|>EVENT<|>The year when NATWEST GROUP conducted scenario analysis to assess climate risk impact on principal risks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>2022<|>EVENT<|>The year when NATWEST GROUP conducted an exercise exploring increased competition in green finance and climate-related risk scenarios)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>2023<|>EVENT<|>The year during which NATWEST GROUP continued to develop climate scenario analysis capabilities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOVERNANCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>NATWEST GROUP's governance structures include policies, processes, and controls to address climate risk and greenwashing)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RISK MANAGEMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>NATWEST GROUP's risk management involves scenario analysis for climate-related physical, transition, and market risks, including stress testing and resilience assessments)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLIMATE SCENARIO ANALYSIS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>NATWEST GROUP's analytical approach to evaluate climate-related risks and impacts on various risk categories)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GREEN FINANCE MARKET<|>GEO<|>Market sector where increased competition can lead to product innovation and governance challenges, as explored in 2022 scenario exercises)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UK<|>GEO<|>Country impacted by climate-related physical events and regulatory developments affecting NATWEST GROUP's operations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NORTHERN EUROPE<|>GEO<|>Region affected by climate-related physical events, such as floods, impacting liquidity scenarios)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EU<|>GEO<|>Region where hypothetical regulation mandates a 50% reduction in carbon emissions by 2030, affecting market risk scenarios)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UK<|>GEO<|>Country where government carbon tax from 2025 is considered in climate transition stress tests)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRUSTEES<|>PERSON<|>The trustees of NATWEST GROUP's pension scheme, involved in managing climate-related risks and scheme resilience)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLIMATE RISK<|>EVENT<|>The overarching risk related to climate change impacts on financial stability, operations, and assets)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLIMATE TRANSITION<|>EVENT<|>The process of moving towards a low-carbon economy, with associated risks and regulatory developments)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GREENWASHING<|>EVENT<|>The risk of misleading claims about environmental practices, addressed through scenario analysis and controls)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATWEST GROUP<|>GOVERNANCE<|>NATWEST GROUP has established governance policies to manage climate risk and greenwashing<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATWEST GROUP<|>RISK MANAGEMENT<|>NATWEST GROUP conducts scenario analysis and stress testing to assess climate-related risks<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATWEST GROUP<|>2020<|>NATWEST GROUP<|>set its climate ambition to support customer transition<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATWEST GROUP<|>FEBRUARY 2023<|>NATWEST GROUP<|>announced updates to its climate ambition<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATWEST GROUP<|>2021<|>NATWEST GROUP<|>conducted scenario analysis on principal risks<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATWEST GROUP<|>2022<|>NATWEST GROUP<|>explored climate risk scenarios including increased competition and physical risks<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATWEST GROUP<|>2023<|>NATWEST GROUP<|>continued to develop climate scenario analysis capabilities<|>6)\n##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
