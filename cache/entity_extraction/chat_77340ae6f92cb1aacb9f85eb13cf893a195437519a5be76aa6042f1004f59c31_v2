We are demonstrating our climate goals through: our \nscience-based targets, our ambition to become a net zero business by 2040, implementing our wider sustainability \nstrategy (see page 22-23 for more details on the strategy), and by transforming our business to embed \nsustainability into all decision-making. We will continue to develop the detail of our TCFD disclosures as we \ncomplete further analysis and strengthen our approach. \nTCFD \nrecommendation Details and our progress in 2022 Where can I find out more? \nGovernance \nA. Describe the \nBoard’s \noversight of \nclimate-\nrelated risks \nand \nopportunities \nB. Describe \nmanagement’s \nrole in \nassessing and \nmanaging \nclimate-\nrelated risks \nand \nopportunities \nA. The Board has overall responsibility for oversight of climate-related risks and \nopportunities but delegates more detailed oversight to its Committees as \nappropriate. \nAs noted in the Board of Directors section on page 61, Pia Heidenmark Cook was \nappointed as a Non-Executive Director in 2022. Pia brings considerable corporate \nESG and sustainability expertise to support with the Board's effective oversight of \nclimate-related risks and opportunities. Additionally, as detailed on page 22, we \ndelivered two Board upskilling sessions as part of our Sustainability Academy. \nIn 2022, the Board approved our new sustainability strategy, recommended by the \nBoard Sustainability Committee (BSC). The sustainability strategy sets out our \nmission to build a healthier future for people and the planet, which also \nincorporates our ambition to be net zero by 2040. \nThe Board approved a revised Enterprise Sustainability Policy to align with the \nsustainability strategy and ensures Market Unit level governance over \nsustainability issues. \nThe Board reviewed and approved our Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions Report \nfor 2021 covering scope 1, 2 and selected scope 3 categories and includes GHG \nemissions data for 2019, 2020 and 2021. The Board was supported by the Audit \nCommittee and BSC in reviewing this report. The Audit Committee also had \noversight over the external limited assurance performed by PwC of our 2021 \nGHG emissions footprint. \nThe Risk Committee (RC) and the BSC have defined responsibilities within their \nTerms of Reference relating to Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG). \nThe RC has oversight of climate-related risks and is aware of how climate \nchange may impact our different business lines and geographies. \nB. The Chief Executive Committee (CEC) is accountable for the executive \nleadership, and execution of Bupa’s sustainability strategy, including our \nnet zero ambition and supporting science-based targets. The Sustainability \nSteering Committee is accountable to the CEC for driving delivery of the \nsustainability strategy. The Committee meets monthly to assess performance \nagainst deliverables and ensure that risks are being identified and \nappropriately managed. The updated Enterprise Sustainability Policy \nreferenced above articulates management’s role in supporting the delivery of \nour sustainability strategy including in assessing and managing climate-related \nrisks and opportunities. \nThe Bupa Enterprise Risk Committee (BERC), which is responsible for the \nleadership and oversight of risk across the Group, along with some of its sub-\ncommittees, also oversees the management of climate-related risks across the \nGroup (e.g., how Bupa’s risk profile may be impacted by climate change, the \nresults of global scenario analyses, mitigations and disclosures). \nClimate-related risks are also considered by first-line fora which are sub-\ncommittees of the BERC; for example, the Corporate Finance Executive and \nSolvency & Capital Committees consider the potential for risks from investment \nportfolio and regulatory capital perspectives. \nMore details on \nsustainability and ESG \ngovernance can be \nfound on page 24 \nFor more \ninformation on our \nsustainability strategy \nsee page 22-23 \nThe Board \nSustainability \nCommittee’s report can \nbe found on page 79 \nOur 2021 Greenhouse \nGas Emissions Report \ncan be found on \nBupa.com here \nThe Audit Committee’s \nreport can be found on \npage 67 \nThe Risk Committee’s \nreport can be found \non page 73 \nMore details on \nmanagement’s role can \nbe found on page 56 \nMore details on our \nclimate-related \nremuneration can be \nfound in the metrics \nand targets section \nof this TCFD table \nBupa Annual Report 2022 101\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
