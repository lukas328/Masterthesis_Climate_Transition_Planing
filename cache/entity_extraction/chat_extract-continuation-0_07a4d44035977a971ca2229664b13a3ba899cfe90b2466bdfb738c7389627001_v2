For Citi’s operational footprint, we have evaluated 360 primary Citi locations through IPCC-aligned \nscenarios. This will allow us to better assess, evaluate and manage the potential climate-related physical \nrisks to which our operations may be subject.  \nAs a result of this work, Citi has improved its understanding of the potential risk impacts to its operations \nwith considerations for:\n1. Incremental Climate Physical Risk Forecast: \nWhich geographic locations have the highest future incremental physical risk exposure due to \nclimate change (includes both acute and chronic physical risk perils)?\n2. Concentration Risk: \nIn which locations does Citi have the highest concentrations of business disruption risk, based on \nstaff concentrations and high criticality processes?\nCiti combines the findings from the concentration risk and incremental climate physical risk forecast to \ngenerate an inherent risk of business disruption due to climate change mapped against each business \nwithin the primary locations for Citi facilities. Through this process, Citi is better able to identify the overall \nclimate-driven inherent business disruption risk and the level of staff and business process concentration in \neach location.\nThe highest operational risks were found to be physical damage risk (from both acute and chronic weather \nevents) and business disruption and third-party risk (from acute weather events). \nWhile this exercise is still an initial methodology that may further evolve, these early findings will support \nCiti’s decision making in areas such as our short- and medium-term placement of processes, staff and \ntechnology infrastructure; policies and standards for high-risk locations; and enhancement of continuity of \nbusinesses and disaster recovery plans, among others.  \n \n Climate Training   \nAchieving our goals and managing risk requires continual learning and development in the climate space. \nAccordingly, we have established a number of initiatives around further training of our workforce across \nthe frontline and various functions. These initiatives included the 2021 launch of a foundational Climate \nRisk Training module firmwide and the provision of supplemental presentations and workshops to target \ngroups. This training aimed to educate a broader audience on the integration of climate risk considerations \ninto our risk management processes. To date, this initial recommended training module has been taken by \napproximately 5,000 employees.\nCiti recognizes that climate-related training needs to be tailored to different positions and teams (e.g., risk \nmanagement employees, frontline bankers and industry teams) where the development of subject matter \n48 | TCFD REPORT 2022: CITI’S APPROACH TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND NET ZERO\nexpertise is imperative. Therefore, in 2022, Citi launched two different training pilots that involved virtual \nand in-person workshops for colleagues in banking, risk and global functions. The first training focused \non foundational knowledge of sustainability and climate science for a cross-business cohort of BCMA \nbankers. The second of these trainings focused on a “deeper dive” in assessing transition plans and client \nengagement, specifically for the Energy and Power portfolios.\nTCFD REPORT 2022: CITI’S APPROACH TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND NET ZERO | 49\nCiti’s climate-related metrics and targets provide quantitative information on our climate strategy and \nperformance. In this section we summarize the operational and financial data that support our climate \nstrategy and performance, and guides our progress towards our Net Zero Plan and our climate-related goals. \n \nOur $1 Trillion Sustainable Finance Commitment   \nThe month after we announced our net zero commitment, we also set our $1 Trillion Sustainable Finance Goal \nfor 2030. This commitment is aligned with the UN SDGs, and spans our business offerings and exemplifies \nhow our Net Zero Plan is being integrated across Citi. We believe that Citi, as the world’s most global bank, has \nan important role to play in supporting businesses’ transitions toward a more just and sustainable low-carbon \neconomy. Our $1 trillion commitment includes environmental and social criteria and is a core component of \nour work to accelerate the transition that supports society’s environmental, social and economic needs. \n \nMetrics & Targets\n \nPART 5\n50 | TCFD REPORT 2022: CITI’S APPROACH TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND NET ZERO\nPROGRESS TOWARDS OUR $1 TRILLION SUSTAINABLE FINANCE GOAL COMMITMENT  \n($ IN BILLIONS)\n1 Following the announcement of the $1 Trillion Sustainable Finance Goal in 2021, we performed a retroactive review of 2020 \nsustainable finance activities using our updated goal criteria, which is reflected in the accounting of environmental and social \nfinance activities on this page. \n2 Denotes activities falling under multiple environmental or social criteria, including green or social bond transactions where the \nissuer’s framework comprises multiple eligible categories.  \n3 Refers to transactions that met both environmental and social finance criteria.
