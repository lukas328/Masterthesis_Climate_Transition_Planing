We are subject to financial services \nregulatory regimes in our insurance businesses and \ncare quality regulators in our provision and aged \ncare businesses. In some cases, our regulators are \nindependent of governments, and in other situations \nour activities are directly regulated by national or \nlocal governments. \nRegulators ultimately aim to make sure that we have \nthe financial resources and the risk management \nframework necessary to protect customers and ensure \nthat they receive high levels of care and are treated \nfairly. These objectives clearly align with our strategy \nand customer-centric ambition. Our regulators \nexpect us to: \n▪ Maintain sufficient capital, with specific requirements \nfor reserves in our insurance businesses \n▪ Provide high-quality, clinically robust services \n▪ Ensure that we operate in a responsible and \nsustainable way \n▪ Have robust and effective processes and controls in \nplace to mitigate risks to protect our customers. \nBupa is firmly committed to achieving high standards \nof compliance with our regulatory obligations in all \nof the markets in which we operate. Increased levels \nof regulation, and liaison between regulators, are a \ncontinuing international trend. Therefore, we take a \nproactive and coordinated approach to managing the \nregulatory risks to which we are exposed in order to \nreduce the risk of our customers suffering detriment, \nand minimising any financial or reputational impact \non Bupa. \nWe have a Group-wide Regulatory Compliance Risk \nPolicy in place to ensure high standards of compliance \nwith the requirements of all relevant regulators. We \nhave a regular programme of interaction with the \nGroup’s lead insurance regulator, the Prudential \nRegulation Authority (PRA), and engage with them on \nkey Board decisions. Senior members of the executive \nteam, the Chairman and the Chairs of the Board’s \nstanding committees have regular meetings with the \nPRA. Relationships with other regulators are maintained \nat a local level by our Market Unit and Business Unit \nmanagement teams, with subsidiary board interaction \nwith local insurance regulators, as appropriate. \nBond investors \nThe Group has a series of debt securities in issue \nthrough Bupa’s subsidiary company, Bupa Finance plc, \nwhich is therefore required to operate in accordance \nwith the relevant UK Listing Rules and the Disclosure \nGuidance and Transparency Rules, and with the Market \nAbuse Regulation. \nBriefing calls are held for bondholders to discuss the full \nyear and half year results. This provides an opportunity \nfor them to question management on Bupa’s financial \nperformance and strategy. We hold road shows for \ncurrent and prospective bondholders during the year, \nand other significant developments are communicated \nvia regulatory announcements, press releases and \npublished on our website, bupa.com. Investors are \ninterested in the Group’s financial performance and \nstrength and increasingly also in our sustainability \nand wider ESG activities. \nAssociation Members \nAs a private company limited by guarantee, Bupa does \nnot have shareholders and the governance and many of \nthe oversight activities performed by shareholders are \ninstead performed by the AMs. This includes voting on \nresolutions at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) that \nshareholders of a UK public listed company would \ntypically be asked to approve. All AMs, other than \nDirectors of the Board (who automatically serve as AMs \nduring their tenure as Directors), normally serve for an \ninitial term of ten years, which can be extended for \nfurther terms of five years. AMs have no equity holding \nin Bupa and no right to dividends, only receiving \nreasonable expenses for travelling for Bupa meetings or \nevents. They are eminent individuals in their own field, \ncoming from a diverse range of sectors including \ninternational businesses – with an emphasis on \ninsurance and financial services, healthcare, academia, \nNGOs, regulatory and public service. \nBupa Annual Report 2022 37 \n        \n         \n        \n         \n         \n         \n         \n          \n        \n      \n       \n        \n         \n         \n        \n        \n       \n      \n        \n          \n      \n            \n       \n        \n         \n        \n        \n           \n          \n         \n         \n         \n   \n         \n        \n     \n        \n    \n       \n \n         \n      \n  \n       \n          \n   \n      \n          \n        \n           \n        \n            \n   \n   \n   \n       \n   \n     \n   \n      \n   \n       \n        \n \n  \n       \n         \n        \n           \n        \n            \n         \n          \n      \n       \n        \n        \n  \n       \n        \n      \n       \n    \n   \n        \n       \n           \n      \n      \n \n       \n            \n       \n        \n        \n          \n   \n   \nStrategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements \nSection 172 statement continued \nAMs are selected based on recent, and relevant \nexperience in their field, their capacity to make a \ncontribution, and experience in the key markets in \nwhich Bupa operates, and a substantial majority of them \nare independent of Bupa.
