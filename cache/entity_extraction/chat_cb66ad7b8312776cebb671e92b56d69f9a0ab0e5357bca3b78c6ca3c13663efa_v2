Scenario analysis is a central part of how we monitor and manage \nour risk profile and our aim is to use analytics to support decision-making at both customer and strategic portfolio \nlevels, recognising this will take several years to fully mature as models, methodologies and data evolve. We are \nactively developing ‘in-house’ modelling capabilities to reduce reliance on third-party models, while retaining \nspecialist input to ensure NatWest Group is at the forefront of the evolving discipline of climate risk management. In \naddition to the Transition Risk Calculator - see page 31, in 2022, our focus has been on:\nCorporate transition risk counterparty modelling: \nWe commenced the build of a flexible, internal, corporate transition risk modelling capability to:  \n • Provide inputs to our heightened climate-related risk sectors selection process, climate risk scorecards, \nand other future internal use cases.\n • Meet future regulatory stress testing requirements.\n • Reduce our reliance on third-party modelling providers and incorporate best practices identified during the \nCBES exercise.\nWe intend to implement these models during 2023, with planned scenario analysis to be executed to support \ninternal use cases and model assurance.\nSectoral scenario modelling: In 2022, NatWest Group also developed commercial and corporate probability of \ndefault models that provide insights on the impact of climate-related transition risk at a sector level using our \ncorporate Transition Risk Calculator as inputs. In 2023, we intend to use this modelling approach for:\n • ICAAP: Our 2021 ICAAP assessment included a forward-looking view of our capital adequacy under a scenario \nleveraging the CBES Late Action scenario, featuring a disruptive transition. Our approach will be enhanced for \nthe 2022 ICAAP exercise to utilise our sectoral scenario modelling to embed transition risk within the \nmacroeconomic variables. This will help capture the risk where we are exposed to sectors expected to be \nimpacted more by climate-related transition risk.\n • IFRS9: The Transition Risk Calculator gives us the capability to translate a forward view of climate policy into \nsector level macroeconomic impacts. In 2022, we enhanced our capabilities to incorporate this into our IFRS9 \nprocesses. As covered in more detail on page 306 of the 2022 NatWest Group plc Annual Report and Accounts, \nwe expect to finalise our review and incorporate this into the Expected Credit Loss (ECL) calculation in 2023, \nonce further testing and checks are completed. A key part of this is determining that any adjustment resulting \nfrom the inclusion of new climate-related inputs does not double count or omit credit losses arising from other \ninputs.\nIf we had applied this information as at 31 December 2022 it would have resulted in a potential increase in ECL \nof less than £25 million. We expect that the effect of climate costs on ECL will increase as government policy, \norganisations and individuals react to changes in climate as well as the probable increased occurrence of \nclimate-related loss events, such as flooding and wildfire.\n • Strategic planning: Using our sectoral scenario modelling, we plan to integrate our central view on the \nevolution of climate transition policy over the planning horizon within the core macroeconomic scenarios used \nas part of our annual financial planning process.\nEmbedding climate in customer and portfolio decision-making: Climate risk scenario analysis gives us detailed \ninsights into the distribution of physical and transition climate-related risk across, and within, sectors. To support \nintegration of climate scenario outcomes into customer-level risk management and decision-making, we have \nincorporated these within the process to identify heightened climate-related risk sectors - see sections 4.2 and \n5.1, and the assessment of customer-level climate-related risk through climate risk scorecards - see sections 3.6 \nand 4.2.\nPhysical risk and real asset modelling: In 2022, we began the development of our in-house physical risk and real \nasset modelling capabilities, which we expect to complete in 2023. While these models are developed, we retain the \ncapability to use our existing physical climate risk scenario analytics to support risk management and decision-\nmaking in these areas, for example in the Transition Risk Calculator.\nScenario Analysis4.2a\nThe resilience of NatWest Group’s strategy, taking into consideration different \nclimate-related scenarios\nDuring 2022, we continued to develop our internal scenario analysis tools and core strategic climate \nrisk modelling capabilities to embed within our existing risk management processes. This builds on our \nwork in 2021 and 2022, in running our internal scenario analysis for participation in the Bank of \nEngland’s CBES exercise, using a combination of our internal models and third-party models. This work \nallowed us to assess our exposure to climate-related risk across our lending book and provided insights \nwhich we continue to incorporate within our climate strategy and used to inform work on the initial \niteration of our Climate transition plan.\nOne of the key lessons from this work is that while climate-related risks could potentially amplify other \nrisk drivers, for example resulting in effects such as the erosion of competitiveness, profitability, or \nreputational damage, overall NatWest Group is resilient to these risks, within the context of the \nscenarios tested. We will continue to monitor and manage this through our enterprise-wide risk \nmanagement framework. This is consistent with the PRA’s aggregate findings from the CBES exercise, \npublished in July 2022, and justifies our continued focus on the measurement, management, and \nmonitoring of climate-related risks.\nA priority area of focus for NatWest Group in 2022 has been the continued enhancement of how\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
