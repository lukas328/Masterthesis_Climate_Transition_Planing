TD’s Climate Target Operating Model (TOM) and ESG Center of Expertise (COE)\nSub-sector: Banking\nIn November 2020, TD announced its Climate Action Plan, including a target to achieve net-zero GHG emissions \nassociated with its operations and financing activities by 2050. 306, 307 Since announcing the plan and targets, TD \nhas joined NZBA and has also announced interim Scope 3 emissions targets for key sectors. 308 TD’s ESG strategy \nis coordinated across the bank and increasingly integrated into its business as usual practices, including through \nthe establishment of its Climate TOM and ESG COE, which have been mobilized to deliver on and embed TD’s ESG \nstrategy throughout the organization. 309 \nTD’s Climate TOM represents an important step toward implementing the actions necessary to reduce the bank’s \nGHG emissions, further embed enterprise climate-related risk management practices into its business activities, \nand capitalize on climate-related opportunities. 310 The Climate TOM is a framework that outlines how functions, \ncapabilities, governance, and supporting infrastructure will be configured or managed to achieve the strategic \n304 Commercial International Bank.

The roadmap describes key milestones TD is focused on achieving over a three-  \nto four-year period to build the required climate capabilities and supporting infrastructure. 313 \nThe ESG COE and Climate TOM work very closely together. The COE was created in 2021 to bring together the \nexperience, expertise, and talent of colleagues working on ESG issues across the enterprise. 314 TD uses both a \ntop-down and bottom-up approach to embedding ESG within its business and culture, in addition to focusing \non educating leadership in key ESG areas to support alignment across the enterprise. The ESG COE coordinates \nexpanding ESG expertise, including understanding climate change, within TD’s lines of business. 315 The ESG \nCOE also facilitates coordination and knowledge-sharing across key areas including research, policies, risk \nmanagement, sustainable financing, and reporting. 316 \nTD has also linked senior executive compensation with the bank’s ESG performance, further reinforcing the \nimportance of ESG as a core component of TD’s business strategy and future. 317 These factors further demonstrate \nTD’s commitment toward creating a culture where colleagues can contribute to and are responsible for advancing \nthe enterprise’s Climate Action Plan.\nExample 27. Bank of America’s training for employees to support clients’ transition to net zero\nSub-sector: Banking\nBank of America is committed to helping finance the transition to net zero before 2050. One of the five pillars in \nits “Approach to Zero™” framework strategy is assisting clients in their own net-zero objectives. 318 Because a key \naspect of its Approach to Zero™ includes extensive engagement with its clients across all lines of business, the \ncompany has developed net-zero awareness training for its banking, credit, and risk teammates to increase their \nknowledge of how best to support clients in reaching net zero. \nIt has created an online ESG (environmental, social, and governance), Climate, and Sustainable Finance college \nthat is available to all teammates. 319 The aim of the training is to deepen employees’ understanding of the primary \ndecarbonization strategies for individual sectors and the financing solutions Bank of America can offer to assist \nclients in their net-zero transition. These training initiatives focus on developing skills and knowledge to help \nenable employees, managers, and teams across lines of business with the design and implementation of products \nand services that will support the acceleration of the transition to net zero. \n311 TD. 2021 TD’s Climate Action Plan: Report on Progress and Update on TCFD , 2021, p. 15.\n312 Ibid., p. 15.\n313 Ibid., p. 6.\n314 TD.
