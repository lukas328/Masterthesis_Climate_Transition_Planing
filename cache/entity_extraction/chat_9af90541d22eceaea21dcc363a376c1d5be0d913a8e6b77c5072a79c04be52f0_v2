In case of a discrepancy, the Spanish original will prevail.\nSECTION 03  / MANAGEMENT OF RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CLIMATE CHANGE\nRisk planning\nRisk appetite Framework (RAF)\nBBVA’s Risk Appetite Framework, approved \nby the corporate governance bodies and \napplicable to all the Group’s material \ngeographic areas, determines the risk \nlevels that BBVA is willing to assume to \nachieve its targets, considering the organic \nevolution of the business. It is organized \nunder a pyramidal structure that starts \nfrom the thresholds of the core metrics \nand the metrics by type of risk and declines \nin a framework of management limits. \nThe Framework has a general statement \nthat sets out the general principles of the \nrisk strategy and the target risk profile. \nThe statement includes a commitment \nto sustainable development as one \nof the elements defined by the BBVA \nbusiness model, focusing on supporting \nthe customer in the transition toward a \nsustainable future, and incorporating the \nclimate factor in risk management. This \nstatement is complemented and detailed \nby a quantification of the appetite through \nmetrics and thresholds that provide a \nclear and concise guide to the maximum \nacceptable risk profile. \nA quantitative transition risk metric has been \nincorporated into the framework since 2021. \nThis High T ransition Risk metric measures \nExposure at Default (EAD) in relation to \ncapital of the activities most exposed \nto transition risk in accordance with the \nT axonomy defined internally (High T ransition \nRisk), focusing on activities classified as \nHigh or Very High risk. With respect to this \nmetric, the Board of Directors of BBVA \nhas approved thresholds at a Group and \ngeographic area level, which determine the \nmaximum appetite for this risk. \nFurthermore, a new metric has been \nincluded in the 2023 management limits, \ncalled High Market Misalignment. This \nmetric is defined as the percentage of the \ncapital base of exposure to customers \nwhose issuance intensity is above 30% of \nthe market average. This metric takes a \ntransition risk management approach by \nfocusing on customers with a clear level of \nmisalignment with respect to the emissions \nintensity trajectories established by the \nInternational Energy Agency, The Net Zero \nEmissions scenario for each of the sectors. \nThe calculation scope is the loan portfolio \nof the autos, power generation, steel and \ncement sectors.\nThe definition of the levels of tolerance \nestablished in the Risk Appetite Framework \nare based on the Risk Assessment and \nScenario analyses described below.\nP.  53\nBBVA Report on TCFD 2022\nThis English version is a translation of the original in Spanish for information purposes only.

These last two \naspects are integrated into the management \nthrough processes such as admission \nframeworks or the establishment of risk \nlimits.\nAs part of its General Risk Management and \nControl Model, the Group develops periodic \nrisk identification and assessment processes \nto identify material risks that could have \na negative impact on its risk profile and to \nmanage those risks actively and proactively. \nThese processes cover all types of risks \nfaced by the Group in its daily activity, \nincluding those risks that are more difficult \nto quantify. Since 2022, the General Risk \nManagement and Control Model specifically \nconsiders sustainability as an essential part \nof the Group’s strategy.\nThe Global Risk Assessment is a prospective \nexercise which updates at least twice a \nyear, and allows a comparison between risk \ntypes, business activities and moments in \ntime, facilitating the understanding of the \nBank’s positioning and its development, \nand identifying the material risks to cover \nwith capital. Since 2020 the Group has \ncarried out a climate assessment, mainly of \na qualitative nature, which assesses BBVA’s \nvulnerability to transition and physical risk. \nAs in the case of the global assessment, \nthe climate assessment process is of a \nparticipative and global nature in the GRM \narea. The results of the assessment are \nsubmitted to the highest executive risk \ncommittee (GRMC), as well as the corporate \nbodies, as this assessment is integrated in \nkey corporate processes such as the Risk \nAppetite Framework and the Internal Capital \nAdequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP).\nThe climate change risk assessment process \nruns parallel to the Group’s global risk \nassessment, although there are two major \ndifferences. First, there are still no mature \nindicators to assess the different risks \nquantitatively and second, the time horizon \nof the analysis is much more extensive. \nThe analysis is carried out for a short-term \nhorizon coinciding with the planning horizon \n(4 years), medium term (4-10 years) and \nlong term (over 10 years). The climate \nchange risk assessment, like the other risks, \nis carried out from two perspectives of the \nglobal assessment:\nP.  54\nBBVA Report on TCFD 2022\nThis English version is a translation of the original in Spanish for information purposes only.
