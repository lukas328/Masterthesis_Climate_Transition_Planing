supplier's \nsustainability performance and helps us prioritise our engagement � \nWe conduct performance dialogues with all scorecard suppliers \nwhich, for low-performing suppliers from any segment, follow up on \nperformance and action plans until our standards are met � \nContractor safety \nAs the safety performance of our own employees has improved \nsignificantly over the years, the performance of contractors has \nbecome an increasingly important focus area �\nWe continue to collaborate with external partners to drive and \nimprove performance across the industry � In 2022, we began \nworking on contractor safety governance � Our data shows that our \ncontractors contribute a disproportionate share of our incidents \nwhen compared to their exposure hours � In 2023, we will strengthen \nour governance through audits and inspections � \nWith the rapid expansion of the wind industry, many inexperienced \ncontractors are exposed to the risks of working at heights, in tight \nspaces, with high-voltage electricity, and surrounded by high-lift \noperations � To minimise these risks, we are committed to only ever \nworking with trained and competent technicians � \nDespite these efforts, three contractor fatalities occurred in 2022 � \nThese incidents have been fully investigated to determine the root \ncauses� In October 2022, we globally implemented a new incident \nmanagement platform to facilitate better reporting, a more \nsystematic approach to determine the root causes, and to follow \ncorrective actions � We also established a set of root cause catego -\nries in our management system to better determine which root \ncauses should be addressed first � \nBeginning January 2023, safety data for all contractors will be \nintegrated within our HSE management system, and despite the \nexpanded scope, we will maintain the same ambitious targets for \ncontractors as for our own employees (see page 45) �\n \nContractor and supplier

them, are stated in our Human Rights Policy, Employee Code of \nConduct, and Supplier Code of Conduct � The policies are publicly \navailable on vestas �com�\nOur Human Rights Policy (see page 41) establishes our commitment \nto respecting human rights and acknowledges community engage -\nment, the rights of indigenous people, land acquisition, and \nresettlement as the most salient human rights issues for our \nindustry � We facilitate non-judicial access to remedy for internal  \nand external stakeholders through our globally applied grievance \nmechanism, which enables host communities to raise concerns  \nor grievances � \nOur Employee Code of Conduct includes the section ‘Our \nResponsibilites Towards Communities �' This topic sets out our \nexpectations towards our own employees concerning engagement \nwith host communities � We expect our employees to engage with \nand listen to host communities respectfully, in an inclusive and \nculturally appropriate way � \nOur commitment to  \nrespect host communities\nAffected communities\nIn addition, our Supplier Code of Conduct includes similar provisions \nrequiring our suppliers to avoid causing or contributing to negative \nimpacts on host communities, to engage with and listen to commu -\nnities in a respectful way, and to establish appropriate grievance \nmechanisms � Information on how we communicate with suppliers on \nour Supplier Code of Conduct can be found on page 53 � \nFurthermore, communities can register complaints via EthicsLine  \nto report any concerns of potential breach of our Code of Conduct \n(see page 42)�\nSocial Due Diligence Process\nWorking together with our clients to prevent and agree on the  \nmost effective mitigation measures for actual or potential social \nimpacts of the project benefits all parties, including local communi -\nties� Our Social Due Diligence framework is implemented globally \nand informed by the findings of our Human Rights Assessment, \ninternational industry practice, and international standards �  \nThe process is an integral part of our Sales Gate Process when \nbidding on a wind farm tender – from Qualifying, to Value \nEngineering and Negotiation � \nThe methodology is applied to projects over a certain threshold \nlocated outside high-income OECD countries, and projects in OECD \ncountries where there might be a risk of impacting indigenous \npeoples’ lands, territories, and livelihoods � In projects where \nindigenous peoples’ lands are involved, we take additional measures \nto establish whether the project has been developed in accordance \nwith national law and international standards � \nOur SDD framework ensures that we identify, prevent and mitigate \npotential adverse human rights impacts on affected communities in \na timely manner, and take their perspective into consideration in our \ndecision-making processes � At the same time, we strive to enhance \npositive impacts, thereby making our projects more inclusive � \n59\nVestas Sustainability Report 2022\nSocialIn brief General GovernanceEnvironment Sustainability data Appendix\nIdentifying, preventing  \nand mitigating social
