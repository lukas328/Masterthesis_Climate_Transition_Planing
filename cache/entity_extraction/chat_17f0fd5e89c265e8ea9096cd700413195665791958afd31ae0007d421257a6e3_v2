We also know that we cannot deliver net zero alone \nand will become increasingly dependent on others,  \nsuch as governments and high-emitting sectors, to \nachieve our net zero goals. That’s why we are going to  \nbe vocal in calling for action from others and convening \nstakeholders to drive the wider system change that  \nwill ultimately be needed to become net zero. \n \nOn a personal level, I am extremely proud of what we \nhave already achieved and excited by the ambition \nencapsulated in our Net Zero Transition Plan. By \nimplementing it, we will be simultaneously playing  \nour part in tackling climate change and helping our \ncustomers secure a life of possibilities.\nWith a baseline carbon footprint of 24 MtCO 2e – \naccounting for 99% of our overall carbon footprint – our \ninvestment portfolio is where we can have the greatest \nimpact. We have placed our customers at the heart of our \nthinking and believe that the actions we are taking to \ndecarbonise our investment portfolio are fully aligned \nwith their financial interests. Our focus is on managing \nthe risks and maximising the opportunities of climate \nchange for our customers. And with recent customer \nresearch telling us that 80% of our customers are \nconcerned about climate change and 90% expect us  \nto invest their money responsibly, it’s also what they want \nus to do. \n \nWe have already taken some exciting initial steps, such  \nas decarbonising c.£12 billion of equity and listed real \nestate in our default workplace pension proposition. \nOver the next 12–18 months we are planning to \ndecarbonise c.£12.5 billion of our shareholder corporate \ncredit, and apply a customised decarbonising \nbenchmark to c.£40 billion invested across our UK and \nUS equity portfolios. By 2025 we aim to have introduced \ndecarbonisation strategies across our £160 billion listed \nequity and credit portfolio. \n \nTaking bold action to reduce our direct operational \nemissions and working with our suppliers to reduce their \nemissions is also crucial. It demonstrates leadership and \nshows that we are willing to walk the walk. That’s why we \nare so proud to have achieved our 2025 Scope 1 and 2 \ndecarbonisation targets for our own operations three \nyears ahead of plan. We will use this as a platform to  \ngo even further on eliminating and reducing our \noperational emissions and scaling up our engagement \nwith key suppliers. \n \nI am hugely excited to be writing this foreword for our \nNet Zero Transition Plan, which marks an important step\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
