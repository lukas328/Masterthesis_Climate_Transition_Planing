While alternative \npowertrains, such as fuel cell and battery \nelectric, continue to develop, automotive \ncatalysts will be needed in engines using \ndrop-in sustainable fuels. We need to be \ndoing all we can to ensure the vehicles \non our roads now are as clean as possible.\nWhat we are doing\nToday, one in three cars worldwide carries \nJM’s emission control technology. And we \ncontinue to invest and innovate to ensure \nthat our technologies help customers meet \nthe higher standards demanded by new \nlegislations. We are investing in our plants \nthroughout the world, and continue to \ninnovate to further optimise performance \nof gasoline and diesel autocatalysts, as well \nas how best to control emissions from \nalternative fuel sources in the future.\nOutlook\nAll over the world, governments are \nbringing in legislation to incentivise \ninvestments in sustainable technology \nand business practices. For example, \n2022 saw the introduction of the Inflation \nReduction Act (IRA) in the US and the \nGreen Deal Industrial Plan in Europe. \nThese sit alongside a growing body \nof national legislation and targets to reach \nnet zero by 2050. \nOpportunities and challenges\nThe market is moving in our direction \nfaster than expected. Across the energy, \nchemicals and transport sectors, the \ntransition being driven by these new \nrequirements is likely to involve a mosaic \nof different technologies and solutions. \nIn addition, governments are increasingly \nfocused on security of supply for critical \nminerals, including PGMs, which is aligned \nto our recycling strategies.\nWhat we are doing\nWe work alongside our partners and peers \nto create a unified voice to help influence \npolicy in a way that accelerates the energy \ntransition. For example, we are working \nclosely with the Association for Emissions \nControl by Catalyst (AECC) and parties \nacross the industry to ensure that the \nEuropean Commission enables a swift \nadoption of the ambitious Euro \n7 emission standards. \nOutlook\nGlobal GDP is predicted to slow in \n2023/24, with some countries potentially \nentering recession. Inflationary pressures, \nsupply chain challenges as well as the \nongoing impact of the conflict in Ukraine \nmight affect activity. \nOpportunities and challenges\nWhile Johnson Matthey continues to deal \nwith economic headwinds, the \nmacroeconomic picture demonstrates \nmore than ever the importance of \naccelerating the energy transition. This \nhas sharpened our focus, enabling us to \nbe laser-clear on our strengths, and make \nprogress towards our 2030 goals.\nWhat we are doing\nOur transformation and commitment to \ncatalysing the net zero transition for our \ncustomers enables us to take full \nadvantage of the opportunities we see \nbeing created in a more volatile and \ncomplex world. We have also adapted \nas necessary. In 2022, we ceased all new \nopportunities in Russia, closed our Moscow \noffice and evaluated all other activities \non a case by case basis.
