\nworkers\nWorkers in the value chain By integrating sustainability requirements into our onboarding  \nand auditing processes, we aim to partner with our suppliers in \nbuilding a sustainable and resilient supply base, attuned to local \nneeds and conditions � \nBased on our Materiality Assessment and Human Rights \nAssessment, the most salient risks identified in the supply chain \ninclude occupational health & safety, sourcing from high-risk and \nconflict affected areas, forced labour and modern slavery, child \nlabour and juvenile work, and the supply chain in general � \nIn addition to our Human Rights Policy (see page 41), we supplement \nthe management of identified risks related to value chain workers \nwith the Vestas Conflict Minerals Policy and the Vestas Supplier \nCode of Conduct �\nThe Conflict Minerals Policy  was enacted in 2022 � We do not source \nminerals or metals directly � However, we do source parts and \ncomponents from our suppliers which might contain potential \nconflict minerals (Tin, Tantalum, Tungsten and Gold) � The policy is \naligned with the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible \nSupply Chains of Minerals and outlines our expectations to suppliers \nregarding responsible minerals sourcing �\n \nThe Vestas Supplier Code of Conduct outlines our expectations to \nsuppliers in four main areas: Human Rights, Working with Integrity, \nRespecting the Environment, and Fair Business Practices � \nThe Supplier Code of Conduct applies to all Vestas suppliers, and is \naligned with our commitments to the UN Global Compact principles � \nIt is also based on international standards, including the \nInternational Bill of Human Rights, the eight core conventions of the \nInternational Labour Organization, and the UN Guiding Principles on \nBusiness and Human Rights � It encompasses all applicable areas \nfrom the Human Rights and Conflict Minerals policies and sets the \nmandatory requirements for our suppliers � It is crucial that the \nhealth and safety of everyone involved in turbine production, \ninstallation, and service is always protected � Thus, a specific section \nof the Supplier Code of Conduct covers our requirements related to \nhealth and safety � \nThe above policies are made public on vestas �com, and the Supplier \nCode of Conduct is an integrated part of the purchase agreement \nwith suppliers � All new suppliers must commit to the code as a \npre-requisite for transacting with Vestas � This is accomplished \nthrough the signing of purchase agreements between Vestas and \nour suppliers �\nWe always welcome questions or comments from our suppliers \nrelated to the Supplier Code of Conduct, and see this dialogue as a \nway to ensure understanding of our compliance requirements � In \nautumn 2022, three webinars were organised with a total of 294 \nparticipants � The aim was to give an understanding of our overall \nsustainability strategy and communicate our expectations of \nsuppliers � A specific webinar covered the social aspects of the \nSupplier Code of Conduct � \n53\nVestas Sustainability Report 2022\nSocialIn brief General GovernanceEnvironment
