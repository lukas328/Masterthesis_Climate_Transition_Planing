These results guide the sector operations strategies, as well as the individualized client management, which may \nhave their risk rating affected. \nIn addition to the portfolio standpoint demonstrated by applying the methodology for the calculation of sensitivity, we also \nmaintain the assessment of climate risk at the client level. \nMethodology for the calculation of sensitivity\nClimate risk management in credit granting\nIn this regard, the risk rating of clients in Itaú BBA  \nsegment becomes sensitive in accordance with their \nexposure to climate risk, for example assessing the \nphysical risk through their sensitivity to water shortage \nor, in the context of transition risk in carbon-intensive \nclients, assessing their ability and resilience to offset \nemissions through carbon credits. Additionally, we \nevaluated the climate management practices of \nour clients to capture actions that contribute to \nmitigate both physical and transition risks to which they \nare exposed.  \nFor products such as long-term financing for projects \n(project finance), for which the risks are primarily \nlinked to the cash flows of the project itself, we apply \nthe Equator Principles, which include management \nof climate change-related impacts based on the \nInternational Finance Corporation’s (IFC) Performance \nStandards. See further details in our ESG Report.\nIn addition, we assess our appetite to assuming climate risk, which is reflected in the limits established and monitored \nmonthly through an integrated approach by the Executive Committee and the Board of Directors.  In this context, in \nDecember 2022, 12% of our credit portfolio was concentrated in sectors categorized with “High” exposure to climate risks.\nrelevance\nclimate risk\ncredit quality\nproportionality\n% of the portfolio\nWeighted Average Term\n+\n48 \nItaú Unibanco Holding S.A.climate report 2022\nadaptation to physical risks in \noperation management\nCases of operational losses from climate events\n \nAdaptation plan: flood in branches and client service interruption  \n • Description of the risk: Every year, in the rain period, some of our branches suffer with natural \ndisasters, such as floods, which affect our operation, creating several risks, such as safety risk \nto our clients and employees and big financial losses to the business.  In order to mitigate these \nimpacts, we conducted a study for branches that have recent history of climate events, aimed at \ndirecting preventive actions to these points of sale.\n • Nature of the impact: financial and non-financial impact\n • Time horizon of the risk: short term (mainly).\n • Scope: national scope with greater number of branches affected in the states of São Paulo, Rio de \nJaneiro and Minas Gerais. \n • Severity: approximately 80 branches (2% of total) with history and potential risk of new events.\n • Nature of the impact: environmental, social and economic.\n • Mitigation actions: we forward the assessment to specialists who will indicate any possible \nmitigating solutions to the branches, based on the surrounding landform, record of floods and \ncharacteristics of the building.\n • Main results: the architectural adaptation of the buildings (floodgates, changes in layout, etc.) of \nseven branches is already in progress.  The recommendation for other cases was to transfer the \nbranch to another location that is not exposed to the risk of flood.\n \nContingency plan for water and energy risks \n • Description of the risk: shortage of electricity supplied by concessionaires and shortage of water \nsupplied by concessionaire, for undetermined period.\n • Nature of the impact: financial and non-financial impact.\n • Time horizon of the risk: cyclical and unpredictable events, impacts may occur in the short, \nmedium and long term.\n • Scope: business center and Data Center.\n • Severity: business departments affected, such as digital branches.\n • Nature of the impact: financial and non-financial impact.\n • Mitigation actions: scheduled annual maintenance of substations, with monitoring of the levels \nof the diesel oil tanks of generators, and simulations of electricity shortage.  And maintenance \nof the level of water inflow in the reservoirs at a minimum of 80%, monitoring of the levels of the \nreservoirs by the operations center and issue of levels of alerts for supply.\n • Main results: no unavailability was recorded in electrical or water installations in the business \ncenter in the past five years.\nIn view of the worsening of extreme natural events, a consequence of climate change, and of our climate risk assessment, we established some plans for adapting to physical risks. Client service \ninterruption is a risk that had to be addressed.  To this end, we conducted a pilot vulnerability study for branches that have recent history of being impacted by climate events, aimed at directing \npreventive actions to these points of sale.
