This is our fourth TCFD \nReport since we voluntarily began reporting \nusing the framework in 2018.\nThis report reflects a summary of our progress \nmade to date towards incorporating climate risk \nand opportunity identification and management \ninto our business strategy and disclosure efforts, \nconsistent with TCFD recommendations. The \navailable tools and methodologies to assess \nclimate impacts, evaluate progress in reducing \ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and assess \npotential climate-driven risks to our own assets \nand business strategy continue to evolve and \nimprove. Citi is committed to contributing to \nmethodology improvements and evolving its \ntools to assess climate risk as well as advancing \nour Net Zero Plan. Climate data, including the \nquantification of the GHG emissions associated \nwith our clients and our estimates of emissions \nassociated with clients’ value chains, will continue \nto evolve as this data improves. \nCiti has committed to achieving net zero emissions \nassociated with our financing activities by 2050, \nand net zero emissions for our operations by \n2030. Our 2021 TCFD Report included Citi’s \nbaseline financed emissions and 2030 targets for \nour Energy and Power loan portfolios, including \nthe methodologies used and initial transition \nplans. This year’s report includes our first update \nsince setting those targets, our progress made \nto date on our Net Zero Plan and inaugural 2030 \ntargets for four additional loan portfolio sectors —  \nAuto Manufacturing, Commercial Real Estate, \nSteel and Thermal Coal Mining. \nOur climate risk and net zero work are related and \nreinforce each other . Whereas our climate risk \nwork focuses on the identification, measurement \nand management of key risks arising from climate \nchange, our net zero work focuses on Citi’s \nimpacts on the climate and achieving our net \nzero emissions targets, which also help reduce \nrisk. Common linkages exist between the two \nworkstreams. For example, both rely on common \ndata elements such as GHG emissions and a better \nunderstanding of our clients’ climate change \nmitigation and/or adaptation plans. Additionally, \nrisk management tools can help achieve our net \nzero goals, and our Net Zero Plan can drive risk \nmitigation, particularly for credit, strategic and \nreputational risk.\nContents\nLetter from the CEO\nPart 1: Introduction \nPart 2: Governance \nPart 3: Strategy \nPart 4: Risk Management  \nPart 5: Metrics & Targets \nPart 6: Looking Forward  \nAppendices  \n04\n06\n11\n17\n39\n49\n64\n67\nTCFD REPORT 2022: CITI’S APPROACH TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND NET ZERO | 3\nOur TCFD disclosure reflects our commitment to \nunderstanding and integrating climate risk into \nour risk management governance, processes and \nstrategies, as well as our commitment to achieving \nour net zero goals.  \n\n4 | TCFD REPORT 2022: CITI’S APPROACH TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND NET ZERO\nThe events of the past year have underscored that the transition to a \nnet zero economy will not be smooth or linear . The global ramifications \nof Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have led to massive volatility in the \nenergy markets and renewed concerns about energy security. This has \ncreated additional momentum for the energy transition to counter the growing climate crisis. It has also \nraised new considerations that must be accounted for . \nAddressing the world’s energy and climate needs will be a balancing act. On the one hand, investing in \nenergy security is essential — the global economy still runs primarily on oil and natural gas and many \ndeveloping nations have neither the resources nor the infrastructure to make a quick shift to renewables. \nAt the same time, investment in clean energy technologies is critical to addressing climate change, and \nsupport for companies working to dramatically reduce their carbon footprints must continue wherever \nthey may be on their respective journeys. These considerations — the energy transition, energy security \nand access to energy — are not mutually exclusive and must be solved for simultaneously.\nAt Citi, we are putting our expertise and resources to work to help our clients tackle these climate and \nenergy challenges. In January 2022, we released our initial plan for achieving net zero emissions by 2050, \nsetting ambitious 2030 financed emissions reduction targets for our energy and power loan portfolios. \nIn this year’s Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) Report, we share our first \nyear of progress towards these targets and set out 2030 targets for additional sectors including auto \nmanufacturing, commercial real estate, steel and thermal coal mining.  \nI have engaged with many of our clients around the world who are committed to doing what it takes to \ntransition to a low-carbon economy. There is a universal acknowledgement, particularly within the hard-\nto-abate sectors and developing economies, that the transition will take time. So, we will continue to work \nalongside our clients as they map out pathways that are orderly but ambitious, whilst ensuring they can \ncontinue to meet the world’s energy needs.\nWe need to invest heavily to scale new sustainable technologies and their supporting infrastructures to be \nviable alternatives to fossil fuels, and we have to drive down their associated cost curves to ensure their \naffordability. Nowhere is the criticality of affordable solutions more important than in emerging markets. \nOur work last\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
