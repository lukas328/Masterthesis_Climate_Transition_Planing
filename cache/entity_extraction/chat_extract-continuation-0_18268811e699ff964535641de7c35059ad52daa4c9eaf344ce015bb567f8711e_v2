In \nparticular, we have developed a climate transition \nstrategy for this portfolio, which aims to better \nidentify the universe of net-zero-aligned assets \navailable to us. Net-zero-aligned assets are based \non Institutional Investors Group on Climate \nChange (‘IIGCC‘) criteria. We intend to invest \n40–50%, of the shareholder liquid asset portfolio \nin net zero-aligned assets by 2025, and 50–70%, \nof the portfolio by 2030. To ensure this remains \non track, we will pursue portfolio tilts and/or \ntrades as necessary to increase the proportion of \nassets that are net zero-aligned. Over time, we will \nlook to extend our thinking on non-indexed \nportfolios to other relevant components of the \ninvestment portfolio where we can increase net \nzero alignment.\nIt is our responsibility to consider financially \nmaterial risks and we believe reducing the carbon \nintensity of our investment portfolio makes it more \nresilient over the long term.\nWe are working with leading index providers to \ndesign customised equity benchmarks which \ndecarbonise, and intend to apply these to all \npolicyholder funds where we have control of the \ninvestment strategy. We plan to initially apply the \ntitled benchmark to UK and US equity assets, \naccounting for c.£40 billion AUA 1. Over the \ncourse of 2024 and 2025 we plan for the \nbenchmark to be applied to equities in other \nregions and our credit portfolios, to a further \nc.£100 billion AUA.\nAligning assets to climate-aware benchmarks \nin this way is consistent with our focus on risk \nmanagement as it enables us to reduce exposure \nto climate risk – which presents a potential \nmaterial financial risk to customers.\n1 AUA as at YE2021. \n3\n31\nPhoenix Group Holdings plc Net Zero Transition Plan\nInvest Engage Lead\nEmbedding net zero \nin our business\nBecoming a \nnet zero business Measuring our progress\nExecutive \nsummary\nExecute actions continued \n1.
