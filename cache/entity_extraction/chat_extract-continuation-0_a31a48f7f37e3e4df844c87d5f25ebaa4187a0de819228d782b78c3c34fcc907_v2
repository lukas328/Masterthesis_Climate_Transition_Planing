Can provide additional co-benefits for local \ncommunities.\nMitigation: Avoiding or reducing emissions of greenhouse \ngas emissions into the atmosphere to prevent the planet \nfrom warming to more extreme temperatures.\nNet Zero: Net zero emissions are reached when \nanthropogenic (i.e., human-caused) emissions of \ngreenhouse gases to the atmosphere are balanced by \nanthropogenic removals over a specified period. A science \nbased approach to net zero covers emission scopes 1, 2 & 3 \nwith direct abatement of approximately 95%\nNeutralisation: refers to long term removal of atmospheric \ncarbon dioxide (offsetting) equivalent to an organization’s \nresidual emissions in order to reach net zero\nOffsetting: Offsetting is a method of indirectly reducing \nresidual emissions after reducing them as much as possible. \nCompanies with residual emissions within their value \nchain are expected to neutralise those emissions with an \nequivalent amount of carbon dioxide removals. \nResidual Emissions: Any greenhouse gas emissions that \nremain after a project or organisation has implemented all \ntechnically and economically feasible opportunities.\nScope 1 Emissions: The direct emissions from owned \nor controlled sources, including company facilities and \ncompany vehicles. These are predominantly from the \ncombustion/use of fossil fuel derived energy sources.\nScope 2 Emissions: Covers indirect emissions from the \ngeneration of purchased electricity, steam, heating and \ncooling consumed by the reporting company.\nScope 3 Emissions: Includes all other indirect emissions that \noccur in a company’s upstream and downstream value \nchain, typically from sources that they do not control or \nown. This includes purchased goods and services, capital \ngoods, fuel and energy related activities, transportation \nand distribution, waste generated in operations, business \ntravel, employee commuting, leased assets, use of sold \nproducts, end of life treatment of sold products, franchises \nand investments.\nSupply Chain Emissions: emissions from our upstream and \ndownstream activities from assets or activities not owned or \ncontrolled by Diageo (see Scope 3 emissions).\nTotal Value Chain Emissions: emissions from our supply \nchain as well as our own operations and activities (i.e. \nScope 1+ Scope 2 + Scope 3 emissions). Also referred to as \ntotal value chain footprint.\nTCFD: Task force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures\nSUPPORTING DOCUMENTS\nTo help us achieve our strategic goals to accelerate to a \nlow carbon world, we are frequently reviewing how best \nto support our colleagues across the business. We are \nupdating, and developing, policies, standards, guidelines and \nimplementation toolkits to enable employees, suppliers and \nother stakeholders to understand what their role is and what \naction they need to take.\nWe want to ensure that we follow a credible decarbonization \npathway using a systems thinking approach that helps us to \nanticipate challenges (i.e. renewable energy intermittency) \nand unintended consequences (i.e. deforestation or shifting \nan impact elsewhere) so we continually build on our internal \nknowledge and capabilities with support from external \nexpertise.\nThe Diageo Environment Policy brings together our \nsustainability pillars, framed by our Society 2030: Spirit of \nProgress action plan and Pioneering Grain to Glass strategic \ntargets. It links our work in carbon & climate to our other \ncritical sustainability focus areas like water, sustainable design \n& biodiversity.\nWe also continue to extend our assessment of climate change \nimpacts, and our existing disclosures, on our journey to \nadopting all the recommendations of the Task Force\non Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). We have \nincorporated the TCFD framework into our reporting and are \naccelerating efforts to mitigate climate change risks and identify \nopportunities for transitioning quickly to a low carbon future.\nOur ESG Reporting Index contains additional information \nwhich is not included in the Annual Report. It is structured as \nthree frameworks: the GRI index follows the GRI Sustainability \nReporting Standards framework, while the UNGC index follows \nthe UNGC advanced reporting criteria and serves as our\nannual Communication on Progress.
