It has established a Net Zero Task Force, led \nby its Chief Sustainability Officer, with leaders from across the business. The task force was formed to collectively \nbuild knowledge on net zero, inform decisions on methodology, and ensure that information is flowing across \nCiti’s businesses. Additionally, Citi has formed sustainability and transitions teams in the lines of business to share \nexpertise and more effectively evaluate and pursue client opportunities. “Through these teams, we have increased \nthe climate fluency of our business team leaders, allowing climate considerations to be better integrated into our \nbusiness decision-making,” the company stated in its 2021 TCFD report.\nCiti acknowledges that a net-zero target must be translated into policies, procedures, and programs that guide \nsustainable finance operations. While Citi has begun this work, it notes that “we are still developing internal \nprocesses in several areas, particularly in identifying metrics and performance indicators to demonstrate Citi’s \nprogress in achieving the targets in our net-zero plan while simultaneously managing our level of risk and returns \non our portfolios.”\nExample 24. MSCI’s clear roles and responsibilities\nSub-sector: Financial Service Provider\nMSCI provides indices, data, and analytics to the financial and investment industry. It has committed to aligning all \nrelevant services and products to achieve net-zero GHG emissions by 2050 or sooner. It has also defined one of its \nstrategic pillars of growth to “Lead the enablement of ESG and climate investment integration.” 296 As part of this, \nMSCI provides and is further developing a wide range of climate-focused data and analytics products and services.297 \nMSCI has established governance processes and structures with clear roles and responsibilities for realizing this \nstrategy. In its 2020 TCFD report ,298 it set out a governance and reporting structure that included describing the \nresponsibilities of the Board’s standing committees, including the allocation of responsibilities with respect to \nclimate change. The Board receives regular updates on MSCI’s net-zero commitment and other climate-related \ninitiatives. MSCI also leveraged its in-house expertise around climate science and climate-related solutions to  \ninform Board education sessions that strengthened the Board’s foundational knowledge of climate, including on  \nnet-zero commitments. 299 \nGoals related to climate change are also KPIs that factor into the compensation of certain executives. While all its \nexecutive officers support its climate initiatives, MSCI’s 2022 proxy statement specifically describes actions taken \nby the CEO and the General Counsel to advance MSCI’s climate capabilities and to help clients transition to a \nnet-zero world.300 In 2022, all members of the company’s Executive Committee, a committee comprising 23 of the \ncompany’s senior-most leaders, will include a climate commitment goal in their 2022 individual KPIs that they will \nbe assessed against in  2023.\n296 MSCI. 2021 Annual  Report .\n297 MSCI. 2022 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and Proxy Statement , March 2022, p. 73. \n298 MSCI.

Proper skills, training, and \ncommunication are needed to ensure that plans are \nimplemented as designed and implementation risks \nare managed. Implementing a net-zero transition \nwill be a multiyear effort and should be designed to \ncontinue being implemented, regardless of changes \nin the Board and senior management. Therefore, \nadoption of the plan requires a commitment \nto culture change, communication, broader \ntraining for employees, and innovation across the \nfinancial institution.\nGuidance: Financial institutions should provide \nsupport required for individuals to perform their \nassigned roles in designing and implementing \ntransition plans. \nOrganizations should consider conducting \nassessments to determine if key individuals have \nthe required skills and knowledge appropriate to \ntheir role. Roles range from strategic oversight \n301 Specific transition skills may include building familiarity with accepted sustainability standards, which will vary based on the \nfinancial institution’s type, geography, and jurisdiction and may include frameworks like the European Union’s Taxonomy, the U.S.  \nSecurities and Exchange Commission’s proposed rules on climate disclosure, or the Science Based Targets initiative’s guidance for \nthe financial sector. Another example of transition skills and training could be technical competency around scenario analysis and \nscience-based transition  pathways.\nof the net-zero transition plan from the Board, \nstrategy oversight bodies, and senior management \nto day-to-day plan execution by employees. \nFinancial institutions should\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CITI<|><organization<|>Citi is a major financial institution actively developing and implementing climate change strategies, including establishing a Net Zero Task Force led by its Chief Sustainability Officer, and forming sustainability and transition teams to integrate climate considerations into business decision-making.>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BARCLAYS<|><organization<|>Barclays is a financial services company that has published a Climate Strategy, Targets, and Progress report for 2022, indicating its commitment to climate-related goals and transparency.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MSCI<|><organization<|>MSCI is a financial service provider that offers indices, data, and analytics to support sustainable investing, with a commitment to achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 or sooner, and has established governance structures to oversee its climate initiatives.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHIEF SUSTAINABILITY OFFICER<|><person<|>The Chief Sustainability Officer at Citi leads the Net Zero Task Force, overseeing the development of climate strategies, building knowledge on net zero, and ensuring effective communication across Citi’s businesses.>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NET ZERO TASK FORCE<|><organization<|>The Net Zero Task Force at Citi is a dedicated team formed to build expertise on net zero, inform decision-making, and facilitate the integration of climate goals into Citi’s operations, led by the Chief Sustainability Officer.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOARD<|><organization<|>The Board of MSCI has responsibilities related to climate change governance, including receiving regular updates on net-zero commitments and overseeing climate-related initiatives.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE<|><organization<|>MSCI’s Executive Committee, comprising 23 senior leaders, has climate commitment goals included in their KPIs, supporting the company’s climate initiatives and transition to a net-zero world.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SENIOR MANAGERS<|><person<|>Citi’s senior managers and their teams are responsible for developing and implementing climate change strategies, incorporating climate goals into performance reviews.>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLIMATE CHANGE<|><event<|>Climate change is a global environmental issue that financial institutions like Citi, Barclays, and MSCI are actively addressing through strategic planning, risk management, and sustainability initiatives.>)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CITI<|>NET ZERO TASK FORCE<|>Citi established the Net Zero Task Force to develop and oversee its climate change and net zero strategies<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MSCI<|>BOARD<|>MSCI’s Board receives regular updates on climate initiatives and oversees governance related to climate change<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MSCI<|>EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE<|>The Executive Committee supports MSCI’s climate goals by including climate KPIs in their performance assessments<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CITI<|>SENIOR MANAGERS<|>Senior managers at Citi are responsible for implementing climate change strategies and integrating climate considerations into their teams’ operations<|>8)\n##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
