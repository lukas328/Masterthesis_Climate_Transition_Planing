We developed in-house forecasts for specific source / demand combinations close \nto our areas of expertise in automotive, chemicals, hydrogen and other industries, while \nensuring that, at a macro level, we remained within IEA’s forecasts.\nWe update our scenarios annually to reflect changes in external drivers, incorporating \nthe latest from internationally recognised sources alongside our own forecasts. Our updates \nin the last year point towards an acceleration in demand for low-carbon hydrogen.\nWe model scenarios up to 2100 (see chart below), but look at shorter-term horizons, \nspecifically 2030 and 2040, to inform our strategic and operational decisions. The table below \ndetails the main qualitative and quantitative assumptions we used for our 2040 scenarios. \nWe use the pragmatic evolution scenario as our base case for our strategic planning.\nMarket Sector Metric (2040) Unit Rapid transition Pragmatic evolution Slow transition\nGlobal Total primary energy demand Exajoules (EJ) 500-550 600-650 700-750\nRenewables supply (excluding use of biomass) % of total energy supply c. 55% c. 35% c. 25%\nAutomotive Global sales of zero-emissions vehicles % of total automotive sales c. 90% c. 70% c. 40%\nGlobal sales of fuel cell electric vehicles % of total automotive sales c. 20% c. 15% c. 10%\nHydrogen Global hydrogen production Mt p.a 350-400 200-250 150-200\nTotal anthropogenic emissions (GtCO2/yr)\nPragmatic evolutionSlow transition Rapid transition\n-10\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n60\n50\n2020 21002060 2065 2070 2075 2080 2085 2090 20952050 205520452040203520302025\nClimate scenarios for evaluating physical risks\nChanging weather patterns as the climate warms may result in physical risks to our assets and \nsupply chains. We have evaluated the exposure of all our assets and those of our strategic \nsuppliers to these risks.\n We used the Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs), the latest climate change modelling \nscenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The SSPs produce \nforward-looking climate data by running climate models driven by assumptions about future \nglobal GHG emissions, together with plausible future socio-economic development metrics \n(economic growth / GDP, demographics, land use and urbanisation), and incorporating the \nlikely implementation of adaptation and mitigation measures.  \nWe looked at three SSPs for the locations of all our own operations and those of our strategic \nsuppliers. We considered four time horizons – 2020 (our baseline), 2030, 2040 and 2050 \nto identify the top hazards and how they are likely to change.\nScenario Assumed temperature increase (relative to 1850-1900)\nSSP 1-2.6 Best estimate of 1.7oC warming by 2041-2060, and 1.8oC by 2081-2100\nSSP 2-4.5 Best estimate of 2.0oC warming by 2041-2060, and 2.7oC by 2081-2100\nSSP 5-8.5 Best estimate of 2.4oC warming by 2041-2060, and 4.4oC by 2081-2100\nSSP 5-8.5 is an extreme scenario that is unlikely to arise, but it is useful for stress testing. \nWe use it to test the resilience of our most important sites.\nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 2023 47\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION\nTask Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures continued\nThrough our scenario work, we identified three distinct potential climate-related impacts, which represent both risks and opportunities for our business. We have added the first climate impact risk \nto our principal risks because it is of strategic importance to our business (see page 62).\nWe use our climate scenarios to evaluate these risks and opportunities in the short (0–3 years), medium (3–10 years) and long term (10+ years), in line with our usual business planning \ntimescales. We believe the pragmatic evolution climate scenario is most likely to occur, so have used it as the base case for assessing our transition impacts, and the other two scenarios to stress \ntest the sensitivity and resilience of our business plans.\nPrimary driver \nof impact\nOpportunities  \n(with time horizons)\nRisks \n(with time horizons)\nManagement  \nof impacts\nFinancial impacts \n(after management)\nKPIs to  \nmonitor impacts \n1.
