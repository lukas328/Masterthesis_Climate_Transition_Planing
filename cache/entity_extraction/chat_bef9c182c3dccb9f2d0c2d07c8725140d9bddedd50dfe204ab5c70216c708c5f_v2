However, The Bupa Pension Scheme’s investment \nstrategy aims to hedge against interest and inflation risk as measured on a long-term funding basis, via a liability-\ndriven investment strategy that utilises a combination of high-quality gilts and swaps. This means that on a funding \nvaluation basis, assets will move broadly in the same direction as the liabilities, although this can differ under the \nIAS 19 valuation. Following the increased bond yields in the period, there was a significant decrease in the value \nof assets, offsetting the reduction in liabilities. \nGiven the scheme’s asset holdings, the key remaining risk in The Bupa Pension Scheme’s investment strategy is \ncredit risk. This is managed via limits on credit quality of counterparties, collateral arrangements in the case of \nderivatives and repurchase agreements and regular monitoring of investment managers. Holdings of corporate \ninstruments are highly diversified by issuer, economic sector and geography. The specific risks associated with \nthe derivatives used in the hedging programme are managed via limits on leverage, stress testing of collateral \nrequirements, and by maintaining a prudent buffer of liquid assets to meet potential collateral calls. This approach \nenabled the Scheme to maintain adequate collateral headroom during the gilt market stress during the year. \nBupa Annual Report 2022 158 \n    \n               \n          \n              \n             \n \n  \n \n    \n      \n      \n      \n  \n      \n                  \n                   \n                   \n                 \n \n                     \n           \n                    \n    \n                   \n  \n          \n                  \n                  \n              \n                \n        \n \n    \n    \n  \n    \n \n \n \n \n    \n     \n \n  \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n    \n     \n \n  \n \n \n                  \n                  \n       \n                     \n                 \n              \n                 \n       \n          \n      \n   \nStrategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements \nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \ncontinued \n7.2 Actuarial assumptions \nThe responsibility for setting the assumptions underlying the IAS 19 valuations rests with Bupa's Directors, \nhaving first taken advice from the Group’s independent actuary. \nThe key weighted average financial assumptions used when valuing the obligations of the post-employment \nbenefit schemes under IAS 19 for the schemes within the Group are as follows: \nFunded schemes \n2022 \n% \n2021 \n% \nUnfunded schemes \n2022 \n% \n2021 \n% \nInflation rate 3.7 3.4 3.8 3.4 \nRate of increase in salaries 4.2 3.8 – – \nRate of increase of pensions in payment 3.1 3.2 4.5 3.8 \nRate of increase of pensions in deferment 3.3 2.8 4.5 3.8 \nDiscount rate for scheme assets and obligations 5.0 1.8 5.0 1.8 \nMedical cost trend – – 4.8 4.0 \n(a) Actuarial assumptions underlying the valuation of obligations \nThe inflation rate assumption is set by reference to the difference between the yield on long-term fixed interest \ngilts and the real yield on index-linked gilts, with a deduction of 0.2% to reflect an inflation risk premium. \nThe rate of increase in salaries is equal to the long-term expected annual average salary pay increase for the \nemployees who are members of the respective schemes. This assumption is set relative to the inflation rate \nassumption. \nThe rate of increase of pensions in payment is the same as the inflation rate, with the exception of benefits which \nreceive fixed increases in payment as defined under the respective scheme rules. \nThe rate of increase of pensions in deferment is set relative to the inflation rate assumption and adjusted for any \nrelevant caps or collars. \nThe discount rate used to value scheme liabilities is the yield at the reporting date on high-quality corporate bonds \nof appropriate term. \nSensitivity analysis of the principal assumptions used to measure scheme liabilities \nThe sensitivity analysis provided below is based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions \nconstant. In practice, this is unlikely to occur and experience variations for some of the assumptions may be \ncorrelated. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions \nthe same method (projected unit credit method) has been applied as when calculating the pension liability \nrecognised within the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. \nRate of increase in \nDiscount rate Rate of inflation salaries Rate of mortality \n2022 \nChange in assumption Increase/decrease \nby 0.5% \nIncrease/decrease \nby 0.25% \nIncrease/decrease \nby 0.25% Increase by one year \nIndicative impact on scheme Decrease £83m/ Increase/decrease Increase/decrease \nliabilities increase £88m £39m £2m Increase £29m \n2021 \nChange in assumption Increase/decrease \nby 0.5% \nIncrease/decrease \nby 0.25% \nIncrease/decrease \nby 0.25% Increase by one year \nIndicative impact on scheme Decrease £165m/ Increase/decrease Increase/decrease \nliabilities increase £204m £69m £7m Increase £71m \n(b) Mortality assumptions \nThe Trustees of The Bupa Pension Scheme undertook a scheme-specific mortality investigation as part of the 1 July \n2020 triennial valuation. Assumptions have been adopted in line with this analysis for the purposes of IAS 19 \nvaluation as at 31 December 2022. \nThe mortality tables adopted as at 31 December 2022 are the S3PA year of birth mortality tables using the CMI \n2021 projection model, with a long-term rate of improvement of 1.5% p.a. adjusted by 95% (male non-pensioners); \n94%\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
