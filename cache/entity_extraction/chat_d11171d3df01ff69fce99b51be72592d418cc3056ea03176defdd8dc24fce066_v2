They oversee, constructively challenge and \nhold to account, management in their implementation \nof strategy within the Group’s system of governance \nand the risk appetite set by the Board. The Board \nconsiders each of the current NEDs to meet the \nindependence criteria in the Code. \nThe Board comprises a majority of independent NEDs, \nand all Directors offer themselves for annual re-election \nby the AMs. NEDs are appointed for an initial three-year \nterm, and any term beyond six years is subject to \nparticularly rigorous review. A copy of the standard \nNED Terms of Engagement, setting out their expected \ntime commitment, is available here on bupa.com and at \nBupa’s registered office. These are also available for \ninspection by the AMs before and during the AGM. \nDuring the year, frequent meetings of the NEDs \nwere held without management present. \nThe Group Company Secretary \nColin Campbell supports the Chairman and the Board \nby ensuring that the Board has the policies, processes, \ninformation, time and resources it needs in order \nto function effectively and efficiently. This includes \nensuring that the Board receives accurate, timely \nand clear information, and assisting in the Board \nand Committee evaluation process, NED succession \nplanning and recruitment, and engaging with AMs, \nincluding arranging the Annual General Meeting (AGM). \nBupa Annual Report 2022 51 \n     \n \n        \n        \n          \n          \n         \n        \n         \n     \n          \n    \n        \n       \n        \n       \n           \n         \n      \n        \n          \n       \n      \n       \n       \n  \n      \n        \n        \n         \n             \n          \n        \n           \n           \n          \n         \n        \n         \n       \n        \n         \n           \n       \n         \n    \n   \n         \n          \n         \n          \n         \n         \n      \n       \n       \n       \n      \n          \n          \n        \n         \n   \n     \n           \n         \n         \n         \n       \n      \n        \n          \n       \n        \n        \n     \n         \n          \n   \n          \n \n   \nStrategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements \nLeadership continued \nBoard diversity, skills and succession \nplanning \nSuccession plans are regularly reviewed by the Board \nand the Nomination & Governance Committee, and we \nplan a phased replacement of NEDs who are coming to \nthe end of their tenure. This approach is designed to \nensure continuity on the Board and to maintain an \nappropriate balance of skills and experience on the \nBoard and its Committees. The Board as a whole \nreviews succession plans for senior executives \nto ensure that we have a strong pipeline of executive \ntalent within the business. \nBupa’s Board Diversity Policy is available here on \nbupa.com. The Policy requires all Board appointments \nto be made on merit, employing objective criteria \nreflecting the skills, knowledge and experience required \nto ensure a rounded and effective Board. The Board is \nfocused on increasing diversity and aspires to achieve \nan appropriate proportion of Directors reflecting \ndifferent ethnic and social backgrounds who have direct \nexperience of some of Bupa’s key markets. At Bupa, the \nconcept of diversity includes race, social, educational \nand professional background, disability, gender, sexual \norientation, religion, belief and age, as well as \nculture, personality, work style, and cognitive and \npersonal strengths. \nDiversity also includes a diversity of perspectives \non what motivates and interests Bupa’s existing and \npotential customers. We aim to ensure that candidates \nfor the Board and senior management are taken from \nas wide a pool as possible, and the firms that assist us \nin our recruitment are all signatories to the Voluntary \nCode of Conduct for Executive Search Firms. Currently, \n33% of the Board, and 27% of the CEC, are women. \nAs at 31 December 2022, 46% (2021: 47%) of the \ndirect reports of the CEC were women compared to \n76% of Bupa’s workforce as a whole. Gunjan Bhow’s \nappointment to the Board has provided some ethnic \nand geographical diversity to the Board as well as \ndigital expertise, which had previously been identified \nas a key gap in the Board’s skill set. \nWe note that Bupa’s Chairman, CEO, CFO and SID \nare all currently men, which falls short of the diversity \nstandards being introduced for UK listed companies, \nand intend to address this in succession planning and \nfuture recruitment for these roles. \nConflicts of interest \nEach Director is required to notify the Company as \nsoon as possible of any actual or potential conflicts \nof interest, and this requirement has been adhered \nto during the year. In addition, the Group Company \nSecretary carries out an annual review of all Directors’ \nactual or potential conflicts of interest and any such \npotential conflicts were recorded and authorised. \nThe Nomination & Governance Committee reviews \nDirectors’ potential conflicts during the year as \nappropriate. Should a conflict arise, the relevant \nDirector agrees to exclude themselves from \ndiscussions and voting on any matter in which they \nmay be conflicted. Many of our NEDs hold external \nappointments, but each NED has confirmed that they \nare able to devote sufficient time to perform their \nrole effectively. \nBoard training and knowledge building \nEach of the Directors is required to keep up to date \non matters potentially affecting the business, and we \narrange regular briefings for them over and above any \ntraining they may receive outside of Bupa. During the \nyear, the Board participated in several development \nsessions on environmental and sustainability matters, \nproviding the Board with valuable reference points in \nan increasingly important area which lies at the heart \nof Bupa’s strategy.
