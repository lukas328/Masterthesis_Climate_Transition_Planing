AXA Investment Managers (AXA IM) takes a “three strikes, you’re out” escalation \napproach for portfolio  companies\nSub-sector: Asset  Management\nAs active asset managers, AXA IM considers its power to influence portfolio companies’ behavior. It believes \n“engagement and open dialogue with companies and clients is crucial to understanding and influencing the net-\nzero trajectories.” As noted by AXA IM 's Executive Chairman, “if we don’t see progress and strong commitments \nfrom companies, we need to be brave and bold in their investment decisions and be ready to divest”. 200 \nBeginning in 2022, AXA IM, the asset management arm of the French multinational insurance company, began \napplying a stronger climate lens in making its investment decisions. 201 AXA IM’s approach involves evaluating high-\nimpact companies and issuers, and grouping them into categories to inform ongoing decision-making.\nENGAGEMENT STRATEGY\nCONTENTS  |  FINANCIAL INSTITUTION NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLANS — FUNDAMENTALS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND GUIDANCE\n66\nWith respect to companies AXA IM considers to be laggards, AXA IM will apply a “three strikes and you’re out” \napproach. 202 This means that if AXA IM does not feel the company’s progress on its net-zero path is substantial \nwithin three years (2025), AXA IM will divest from the company so that it can reallocate the capital to climate \ntransition leaders.  \nThis example is one approach of an escalation process for a portfolio company engagement strategy. When \nclients or portfolio companies show little or no response to calls for climate action, a financial institution should \nconsider using the stewardship or financing levers at its disposal.\n202 AXA IM. 2021 Active Ownership and Stewardship Report , May 2022, p. 10.\n203 Blackrock.

BlackRock’s public-private finance vehicle ― Climate Finance  Partnership\nSub-sector: Asset  Management\nBlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, completed the fundraise of its Climate Finance Partnership (CFP) \nFund in October 2021, achieving a $673 million final close ,203 exceeding its target by 35%. The CFP is a public-\nprivate finance vehicle, first announced in September 2018, that is focused on investing in climate infrastructure \nacross emerging and developing markets. CFP is supported by a diverse global investor group including \ngovernments, philanthropies, and institutional investors.  \nThe Climate Finance Partnership is built on the following:\nBlended Finance Structure: CFP uses a structure that seeks to de-risk the investment in emerging markets for \ninstitutional investors. 204 The governments of France, Germany, and Japan, together with U.S.  philanthropic \ninstitutions and a global multi-energy company, participate through a subordinated equity tranche to incentivize \nprivate investors to participate.\nClimate Infrastructure Investing:  CFP aims to invest in climate solutions such as onshore wind and utility-scale \nand distributed solar PV, and supporting climate infrastructure such as battery storage and clean transmission \nprojects. Through these investments, the CFP aims to reduce potential emissions from emerging markets by \npreventing the need for incremental fossil fuel development and generation while providing access to affordable, \nreliable, clean  energy.\nESG Risk Identification, Management, and Reporting:  CFP is implementing an ESG framework compliant with \nInternational Finance Corporation (IFC) performance standards to support the entire life cycle of its investments. \nCFP has also put together a collaborative committee composed of experts across BlackRock and some of CFP’s \ninvestors, seeking to bring together leaders in the field of ESG risk identification and management. CFP and its \ninvestors will also feature measurement and reporting aligned with the UN SDGs, Global Impact Investing Network \n(GIIN), and Impact Reporting and Investment Standards (IRIS).  \nThis fundraising effort is an example of how financial institutions can engage with private and public partners, \nincluding their clients, to mobilize institutional capital for the transition in emerging markets.\nENGAGEMENT STRATEGY\nCONTENTS  |  FINANCIAL INSTITUTION NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLANS — FUNDAMENTALS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND GUIDANCE\n67\n \nExample 14.

Dai-ichi has also been participating in collaborative engagement initiatives \nsuch as Climate Action 100+ and Institutional Investors Collective Engagement Forum (IICEF) to add to its \nengagement  activities.\nWith regard to climate change issues, Dai-ichi asks companies to 1) set ambitious reduction targets consistent with \nthe Paris Agreement, 2) formulate a concrete roadmap to achieve the targets, and 3) integrate the targets and \nroadmap into their medium- and long-term strategies. \nDai-ichi tracks engagement progress based on four milestones:\nFigure 16: Dai-ichi engagement  milestones\n41\n Progress has been made to solve the issues raised with\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
