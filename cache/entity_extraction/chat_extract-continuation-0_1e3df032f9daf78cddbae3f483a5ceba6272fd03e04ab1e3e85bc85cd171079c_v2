The content \nof these plans includes an analysis of the \nrisks and opportunities of the sector, the \nlong-term vision of the role of the sector in \nthe decarbonization of the economy and \nthe strategic responses of the actors of the \nentire sector.\nIn addition, the plans include an analysis \nof the current state of the portfolio and \nthe positioning with respect to the Group’s \nobjective for the sector, as well as the \nidentification of drivers to manage the risk \nof portfolio transition, including the portfolio \nalignment metric. All this is reflected in \nthe formulation of a business plan, which \nincludes the identification of opportunities \nwith existing and potential clients, and \na tiered approach to define the appetite \ntowards clients in the sector. These business \nplans allow the definition of projected \ndecarbonization curves for each sector to \nmonitor progress in the alignment exercise.\nDuring 2022, a series of multidisciplinary \nworking groups have been launched, \nmade up of teams from GRM, CIB, \nSustainability and Strategy, called Climate \nand Environmental Sectoral Panels. These \ngroups have developed Sector Strategic \nPlans in the oil & gas and electricity \n(which includes electricity generation) \nsectors. This work has made it possible \nto define strategies and business plans \naimed at meeting the alignment objectives \nestablished in the medium term as \nwell as mitigating the risks related to \ndecarbonization in the balance.\nThis work is a fundamental part of portfolio \nalignment management and input for the \ndefinition of the risk appetite included in \nthe Sector Frameworks. In 2023, plans will \nbe implemented for the rest of the sectors \nfor which an alignment objective has been \ndefined.\nP.  60\nBBVA Report on TCFD 2022\nThis English version is a translation of the original in Spanish for information purposes only. In case of a discrepancy, the Spanish original will prevail.\nSECTION 03 / MANAGEMENT OF RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CLIMATE CHANGE\nLoan portfolio alignment with \nNet Zero 2050\nThe Net Zero 2050 commitment (zero \nnet emissions in 2050) also includes \nemissions from customers who receive \nfinancing from the Bank. For this reason, \nin order to accompany its clients in the \ntransition towards a more sustainable future, \nwith specific plans and objectives, BBVA \nundertook to publish alignment objectives \nfor the sectors defined  in the Guide to set \nthe Net Zero Banking Alliance objectives.\nBBVA’s commitment to alignment involves \nestablishing a framework comprising \nobjectives and commitments for the \ndifferent sectors considered to be the \ngreatest emitters. These objectives, as \ndefined in the aforementioned Guide, must \nbe set at the sectoral level. In this sense, \nBBVA announced its objective of phase-\nout of activities related to coal, ceasing \nto finance companies involved in these \nactivities before 2030 in developed countries \nand before 2040 in the rest of the countries \nin which BBVA is present. (under the terms \nof the Environmental and Social Framework).\nUnder the PACTA methodology, BBVA \npublished intermediate decarbonization \ntargets for 2030 for the power generation, \nautos, steel and cement sectors, which, \ntogether with coal, account for 60% of global \nCO2 emissions. The Net Zero scenario of the \nInternational Energy Agency (IEA) has been \nused as a benchmark. \nIn 2022, BBVA published its alignment target \nfor the Oil & Gas sector. BBVA is participating \nin the definition within the NZBA of a specific \nguideline for this sector. However, given its \nrelevance in global emissions, it was decided to \npublish a metric that would include the largest \namount of emissions given the information \navailable. The PCAF methodology has been \nused for the calculation and a scope 1, 2 and 3 \nabsolute emission reduction target has been \nestablished for oil exploration and production. \nIn order to follow up on these objectives and \nsupervise their compliance, a Sustainability \nAlignment Steering Group (SASG) has \nbeen created made up of the heads of the \nBusiness, Risk, Sustainability and Strategy \nareas, with the following functions:\n Approval of the proposal of the sectoral \nalignment objectives and intermediate \nobjectives, as well as the methodologies \nused in their calculation\n Evaluation of the fulfillment of these \nobjectives and the promotion of initiatives \nto facilitate their management.\n Analysis and understanding of the best \npractices in the sector, promoting the \nintegration of sustainable criteria in day-\ntoday business.\nAfter having passed through the SASG, \nthe monitoring of compliance with the \nobjectives, including the explanation \nof possible deviations and measures \nto redirect them (if applicable), will be \nsubmitted for review to the highest \nexecutive level and subsequently to the \ncorporate bodies, at least twice a year.\nT o facilitate effective management and \ncompliance with the alignment objectives, \nBBVA has developed a series of internal \ntools that allow it to integrate the \nmanagement of these objectives into the \nday-to-day risk and business processes. \nThese tools include:\n Alignment dashboard  with PACTA \nmethodology.\n TRi (T ransition Risk Indicator), a tool \nfor assessing each customer’s current \nemissions profile and decarbonization \nstrategies.\n Sustainability Client T oolkit , which \ncompiles ESG information from large \ncorporations and/or entities with \npublic information that is required at \nmanagement level in a single repository \nfor use from the front end. \nFor additional information, see section \nMeasurement and integration of transition risk.\nP.  61\nBBVA Report on
