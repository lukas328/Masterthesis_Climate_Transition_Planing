We also award points on 0.25 \nincrements, based on the level of disclosure companies provide and the quality of the response. The Risk Management & Accounting pillar has only two indicators, whereas the Strategy pillar can achieve up to \nnine indicators for some sectors. The qualitative nature of assessing Governance and Strategy indicators also lends them to undergo more scrutiny. We demand strong governance and robust strategies in place, \nand there are always areas where more disclosure is required. The more companies disclose, the more of their plans and processes we can assess. The highest scoring pillars of the framework are Transparency \nand Metrics & Targets. Transparency, with three indicators, is relatively easy to score high on, as the assessment is on the production of reports and not an assessment of the quality of reporting â€“ such issues are \noften raised in other parts of the assessment framework. The Metrics & Targets pillar scores companies on a reasonably quantitative basis and most listed companies are accustomed to disclosing carbon \nemissions data.\n3\n36\nPhoenix Group Holdings plc Net Zero Transition Plan\nInvest Engage Lead\nEmbedding net zero \nin our business\nBecoming a \nnet zero business Measuring our progress\nExecutive \nsummary\nExecute actions continued \n2.
