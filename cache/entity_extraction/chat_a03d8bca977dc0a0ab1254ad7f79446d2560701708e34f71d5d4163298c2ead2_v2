Our initiatives thus far \nOver the last 20 years, Mizuho has taken part in a number of initiatives and pilot programs related to the environment and climate \nchange, and we are applying the expert insights and knowledge we have gained from these experiences to moving forward our \nclimate change initiatives. \n \nEngagement (constructive dialogue) with clients has been attracting greater interest as one aspect of the important role financial \ninstitutions have to play. We began our engagement initiatives in 2018, ahead of other  financial institutions, and have continued \nto improve on them since then. We are also improving our disclosures, having become in FY2020 the first financial services group \nin Japan to publish a TCFD Report. \n \nIn FY2021, in line with our policy of positively contributing to the achievement of a low-carbon society by 2050 and of undertaking \ntransformation to a portfolio aligned with the targets in the Paris Agreement, we began working toward measuring our GHG \nemissions from financing and investment and setting medium- to long-term targets. Alongside this, we joined related international \ninitiatives. \n \nIn July 2021, we became the first Japanese financial institution to join the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF), \na global initiative that enables financial institutions  to measure and disclose the indirect GHG emissions of their loans and \ninvestments. In November 2021, we were appointed chair of the PCAF Japan coalition, which was launched by the Japanese \nfinancial institutions participating in PCAF. \n \nIn October, we join ed the Net -Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA), an international banking initiative aiming to align lending and \ninvestment portfolios with net-zero GHG emissions by 2050. \n(See pages 66 and 27 for details about PCAF and the NZBA.) \n  \n  \nTCFD Report 2022  -13- \n \nFigure 2: Our initiatives thus far \n \n Endorsed the Task Force on Climate-related \nFinancial Disclosures (TCFD)\n Participated in Climate Action 100+ \n(Asset Management One)\n Became signatory to the UN PRI\n(Asset Management One)\n2018\n2020\n Established the Environmental Policy\n Set targets for sustainable finance and targets to \nreduce outstanding credit balance for coal-fired power \ngeneration facilities\n Issued TCFD Report (the first \nfor a financial group in Japan)\n Disclosed SASB Index\n Implemented fourth update to the Equator Principles \n(“EP4”) (Mizuho Bank)\n Participated in the Net Zero Asset Managers \ninitiative\n(Asset Management One)\n2021\n Strengthened commitment and response towards \naligning with the Paris Agreement\n⁃ Revised the Environmental Policy, clarifying the \ntransformation to a portfolio aligned with the targets \nin the Paris Agreement\n⁃ Established new Scope 1 and 2 targets for the \ngroup to reduce greenhouse gas emissions\n⁃ Strengthened transition risk response (develop\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
