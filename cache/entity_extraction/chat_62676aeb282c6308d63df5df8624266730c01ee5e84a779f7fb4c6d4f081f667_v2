The hub \nworks for the purpose of generating knowledge, innovation \nand connections for low-carbon solutions, in addition to \npositioning and communication. Among the main results of \nthe hub in its launch year are:\n • 28 startups participating in the ESG hub at \nthe end of 2022\n • Organization of the BID ao Cubo Bioeconomia (IDB at \nCubo Bioeconomy) in partnership with the Inter-American \nDevelopment Bank (IDB) for the purpose of accelerating \nstartups focused on bioeconomy in the Northern and \nNortheastern regions of Brazil\n • Organization of four sector MeetUps focused on \nthe Agriculture, Energy, Oil and Gas and Steel and \nIron industries.\nAgriculture MeetUp \nThe event had the participation of representatives from the industry, Itaú Unibanco and the startups and discussed the main decarbonization challenges in the sector, in \naddition to the ESG topics in general, such as the challenge of supply chain management, measurement of greenhouse gas emissions and generation of high-integrity carbon \ncredits.  The video of the event is available here and the content prepared based on the discussions was made available on Blog do Cubo (Cubo’s Blog).\nOil and Gas MeetUp \nThe second sector event organized by Cubo ESG discussed the decarbonization challenges in the Oil and Gas chain, including the challenges of reducing greenhouse gas \nemissions and capturing carbon. The video of the event is available here and the technical content is available on Blog do Cubo (Cubo’s Blog).\nEnergy MeetUp\nOrganized after COP27, it presented an overview of the main results of the event and discussed important challenges and innovations for the industry, such as the greater \noffer of renewable energy and the possible solutions brought by the increase in the use of green hydrogen. The video of the event is available here and the technical content \nis available on Blog do Cubo (Cubo’s Blog).\nSteel and Iron MeetUp\nThe event discussed the main challenges for the decarbonization of the sector that plays a crucial role in the Net Zero agenda by meeting the demand for more sustainable \nmaterials and the specific challenges of Brazil, such as the importance of a regulated carbon market.  The technical content is available on Blog do Cubo (Cubo’s Blog).\nOver the course of 2023, Cubo ESG will also have the ESG Journey, which is aimed at identifying the main decarbonization challenges and opportunities of our clients and connecting them to \nthe hub’s startups.  Among the activities expected are the organization of thematic events and the assessment of up to 100 Brazilian corporations by means of surveys and in-depth interviews. \n28 \nItaú Unibanco Holding S.A.climate report 2022\nAssociations\nWe participate in forums such as the Brazilian \nBusiness Council for Sustainable Development \n(CEBDS), the Global Compact, the International \nChamber of Commerce, the Brazilian Coalition \non Climate, Forests and Agriculture and the \nCommitment to Climate and we engage in \ndialogue with the many industries of the real \neconomy, contributing to the dissemination of \nknowledge and cooperating with the different \ndecarbonization challenges.  The participation \nin these forums has been providing us with \na broader knowledge of the decarbonization \nchallenges of our clients.\nWe also participate in specific forums of the \nfinancial industry, such as the Brazilian Federation \nof Banks (FEBRABAN), the United Nations \nEnvironmental Programme Finance Initiative \n(UNEP-FI), the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA), \nthe Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero \n(GFANZ) and the Amazon Plan, which enable the \nexchange of knowledge and progress in initiatives \nthat increase the role of the financial system in \nthe decarbonization agenda.  As an example, our \nparticipation in the Working Group of UNEP-FI \nhas allowed for the construction of a broad base \nof knowledge with respect to the implementation \nof the Task-Force on Climate-Related Financial \nDisclosures (TCFD) in financial institutions from \nall over the world. The content is available on the \nUNEP-FI website. \nPublic Authorities \nA significant part of the decarbonization \nagenda depends on the formulation of public \npolicies. For this reason, we have an active \nadvocacy strategy to encourage the \npromotion of knowledge and actions for the \ndecarbonization of the real economy, just like \nour work with the Executive, Legislative and \nJudiciary branches, together with many relevant \nmarket players, associations and representation \nentities, for the alignment of understandings \nand the submission of recommendations on bills \nthat are pending in the National Congress on \nthe ESG and climate topics, such as the case of \ncarbon market regulation. Regarding the records \nof interactions with public agents, we identified \n9 agendas related to bills involving carbon credit \nregulation (here under the financial product \nimpact bias). \nSuppliers\nFor the purpose of working on all links of the \nchain, we also promote engagement with our \nsupply chain by means of a questionnaire to \nqualify the practices adopted with respect \nto environmental, social and climate topics \nand also carry out a workshop for active \nsuppliers and the office responsible for this \nrelationship. Together with CDP , we provide \nspecific training on disclosure of emissions \ndata for suppliers taking into consideration \nthe industries in which they operate and the \nvolume of their contracts.\n29 \nItaú Unibanco Holding S.A.climate report 2022\nBusiness: Reduce impacts and generate \nopportunities \nIn our climate strategy, we also carry out\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
