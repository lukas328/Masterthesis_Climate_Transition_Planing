Currently, Vale is seeking to reduce Scope 3 by \n15% by 2035. During our engagement, the company highlighted the approaches \nit is taking to achieve this:\n É½ Vale aims to shift its product portfolio towards higher quality iron ore. \nItsÂ â€˜green briquettesâ€™ can reduce its steelmaking customersâ€™ production-\nprocess emissions by 10%.\n É½  The company will report on how many of its customers have emissions \nreduction targets and has engaged with 50% of them on this issue. \n É½  It currently has two eco-shipping pilot programmes.\nWhile US$4-6 billion of capital expenditure has been allocated to addressing \nScope 1 and 2 emissions, there is still too much uncertainty to set a budget \nforÂ Scope 3. \nPositively, we note Valeâ€™s focus on the justice element of transition. The impacts \nof the company on livelihoods, communities and wellbeing are key considerations \nfor Valeâ€™s sustainability team. While there is no formal policy on just transition, \nwe are pleased to see the social aspect embedded in the way Vale views \nsustainability â€“ a substantial change following the devastating dam collapse \ninÂ 2019. \nEquities\nEnvironmental \nSustainabilityÂ and Stewardship Report\n39\nCase study:\nVerisign: challenging on diversity, equity \nandÂ inclusion policies and progress\nObjective The Ninety One Quality philosophy means the investment team has a natural \nbias towards businesses that rely on intangible competitive advantages \nsuch as technological expertise or brands. The attraction and retention of \ntalent is often a key risk and opportunity for such companies, and therefore \nthe way that companies manage diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) is \nhighly relevant to these human capital-reliant businesses. Applying our \nDEI analytical toolkit, the Quality teamâ€™s research flagged Verisign, which \nprovides domain-name registry and other internet-related services, as an \nengagement priority, as it lags peers in several respects, including on DEI \ndisclosures.\nOutcome\n \nThe companyâ€™s response to the engagement was positive, and a one-to-\none meeting gave the investment team comfort on Verisignâ€™s direction \nof travel. Under the leadership of a recently appointed DEI director, \nVerisign is now discussing improving disclosure, and whether to introduce \nrepresentation targets and/or a DEI component to remuneration. We will \nmonitor developments and engage as necessary to support Verisign on \nthis journey. \nSocial\nEquities\nSustainabilityÂ and Stewardship Report\n40\nCase study:\nTransnet: addressing issues impacting \nSouth African infrastructure\nObjective Transnet owns South Africaâ€™s railway, ports and pipelines infrastructure \nand is the largest and most crucial part of the countryâ€™s freight logistics \nchain. We have been engaging with company management to discuss \nmanagement effectiveness and board composition.\nWe initially set out our concerns to management in writing, highlighting \nthat investor confidence is already weak on the back of the companyâ€™s \npoor operational performance. This has led to cash interest covenants \nbeing breached, which raises significant concern over the companyâ€™s \nability to access debt capital markets at a time when Transnet has large, \nimminent refinancing needs. As one of the largest debt investors in the \ndomestic market, we are also concerned about the multiplier effect on \nthe economy if a solution for the rail network is not reached quickly. An \napparent lack of the necessary operational and financial skills in the \nleadership team, with vacant board seats and a lack of appropriate skills on \nthe board, increased the lack of confidence in the company. We urged the \nboard to demonstrate to the debt capital markets that there is a credible \nturnaround plan. Our concern was that if Transnet does not present \na credible action plan soon, local investors will step away, which will \nsignificantly exacerbate the problems faced by Transnetâ€™s balance sheet. \nThis communication was followed up by an in-person meeting with the \nexecutive team. Management indicated that the board was in discussion \nwith the Department of Public Enterprises (Transnet is 100% owned \nby the South African government) and was anticipating an imminent \nannouncement on filling the vacant seats as well as bringing the right \nskillsÂ onboard.\nOutcome The board seats have now been filled and we have since seen an \nappreciable turnaround in operational performance and management \nfocus. Additionally, the National Treasury has been working with the \nNational Logistics Crisis Committee to put in place a government \nguarantee facility to assist in the acute liquidity requirements.\nGovernance\nFixed Income\nSustainabilityÂ and Stewardship Report\n41\nAlternatives Case study:\nP3 Group\nObjective There have been many instances of poor corporate governance in \nEuropeâ€™s real estate sector in recent years. Since the end of ultra-low \ninterest rates and as financing conditions have tightened, evidence \nof improper dealmaking, aggressive accounting practices, complex \nand obscure capital structures, and a need for more consistent \nreporting criteria have come to light. P3 Group, an industrial-focused \nReal Estate owner and developer in Europe, is currently executing an \nacquisition-led growth strategy, which exacerbates the governance-\nrelated risks the sector is prone to. We engaged with the management \nteam of P3 to gain a deeper understanding of the groupâ€™s corporate \ngovernance policies, board and capital structure. We aimed to get a \nsense of managementâ€™s risk tolerance and understand the policies and \nstructures in place to keep this in check.\nOutcome\n \nOur engagement helped us to conclude that the conservative nature \nof P3â€™s funding, and the scale of its investments and growth targets, \nalongside its solid corporate governance foundations, help mitigate \nsome of the inherent risks of an acquisition-led growth strategy\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
