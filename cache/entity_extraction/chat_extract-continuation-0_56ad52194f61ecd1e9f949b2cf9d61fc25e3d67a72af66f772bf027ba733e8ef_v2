Rebaselined to remove divested businesses, please see page 222 for more information\nInternal carbon pricing (ICP)\nLast year, we introduced a shadow carbon price to our capital investment business case \nassessment process, as recommended by the Bank of England. The intention is that this will \nincentivise us to reach net zero by ensuring all investments are made in the context of a \nlow-carbon world where the price of carbon is higher than it is today. Although the ICP is not \na real cost of the investment, it demonstrates what the impact would be of carbon taxation \nforecast for 2030 and beyond, and we use it to evaluate and compare potential investments. \nWe have implemented the ICP for Scope 1 and 2 emissions for the asset when operational. \nThe intention is to extend this to Scope 3 (raw material and supply chain impacts emissions) \nin the future. We chose not to apply ICP to emissions related to the development of the \nproject itself, such as equipment manufacture, or to construction-related emissions, since \nsuch emissions are both short term and generally minor in relation to the overall life of the \nasset. The price applied in 2022/23 was £100/tonnes CO2e, with sensitivity analysis conducted \nat £50/tonnes CO2e and £150/tonnes CO2e.\nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 202352\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION\nTask Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures continued\nChief Financial Officer’s review\nDespite challenging markets, we have made steady \nprogress in implementing our new strategy – doing \nexactly what we set out to do and starting to win back \nthe trust of stakeholders.\nExecuting with discipline\nDuring this year, I have spent a lot of time speaking with our internal and external \nstakeholders, and the message is clear. They see the pathway for strong ongoing cash \ngeneration from our mature businesses, as well as the exciting potential of our growth \nopportunities in hydrogen and catalyst technologies, all underpinned by our leading \ntechnology. But they have also been repeatedly disappointed by our performance and \ninvestment decisions in recent years and want to know why it will be different this time. \nSo, 2022/23, with our new leadership team, has been about doing what we said we would \ndo at the start of the year. We have achieved the key milestones we set for this year, and \nour strategic scorecard is in good shape. This is an important part of showing ourselves, \nour investors and other stakeholders that we not only have market-leading technology and \nexpertise – but we are positioned for long-term value creation too. While still early days in \nexecuting our strategy, I am encouraged by the progress that has been made to date and \nmore convinced than ever that we have set the right path to growth for Johnson Matthey.\nWe have continued to simplify our portfolio during the year, announcing the sale of Piezo \nProducts and the Diagnostics Services business. We are on track on our remaining \ndivestments. Simplifying the business removes complexity and allows us to focus on our core \nstrengths and the engines of growth within the business. \nInternally, our cost-reduction programme is making inroads by simplifying, standardising and \ngetting greater value from our back-office functions. We have delivered c. £45 million in cost \nsavings this year and will further accelerate our efforts on this front in the coming years \nto more than deliver our £150 million savings target. \nOur transformation, including the simplification of the portfolio and streamlining of \nprocesses, is further building a strong platform for growth. As Liam has noted, our growth \nopportunities are even greater than initially anticipated and they are approaching fast. \nTo capture these opportunities we need to invest, and we will do so in a disciplined way, \nfocusing on returns and keeping capex under control. I’m pleased to see the progress \nwe have made with our large projects on time and on budget. And of course, we are focused \non investing behind customer demand, which gives us more confidence in the returns from \nthese investments.\nIt is particularly encouraging that we were able to make so much headway towards our \nstrategic objectives despite a challenging macroeconomic backdrop and difficult operating \nenvironment. This is testament to the dedication and hard work of the team at JM, and that \nwe see encouraging signs that our efforts are paying off. \nNavigating economic headwinds\nJM’s underlying operating profit was £465 million, down 21% from 2021/22 as we were \nimpacted by lower auto production, higher inflation and lower platinum group metal prices. \nAs expected, we saw a stronger second half of the year with operating profit down 12% \nas we increased prices and saw the benefits of our efficiency programmes. Our balance sheet \nremains strong: net debt to EBITDA was 1.6x, towards the bottom of our stated range, \nwhile free cash flow was £74 million. We delivered c. £45 million in efficiency savings during \nthe year, well on the way to achieving our target of £150 million annualised savings by end \n2024/25. Our capital projects programme is also on track in terms of the amount invested, \nexpected returns and timing of execution.\nWe acted quickly to get costs down when the war in Ukraine disrupted supply chains and \nadded to significant inflation. But inflation has impacted\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>JOHNSON MATTHEY<|><organization<|>Johnson Matthey is a global specialty
