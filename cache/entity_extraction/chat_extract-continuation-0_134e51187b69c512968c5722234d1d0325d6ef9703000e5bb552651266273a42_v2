The Board is pleased with the \nprogress made on the strategy to date as detailed in \nthe Strategic Report, demonstrated by our improving \nunderlying profit and progress towards achieving the \ntarget KPIs under the 3x6 strategy, particularly against \na challenging backdrop of the current global macro-\neconomic environment. The Strategic Report gives \nmore detail on the progress of our strategy during \nthe year. \nOversight of our strategy includes reviewing the \nperformance of underperforming businesses and \nensuring that management are taking actions to \nimprove their performance and, where necessary, to \nturn them around. Bupa Global has performed strongly \nin 2022 as part of our focused portfolio management \napproach. Sanitas Mayores, our aged care business in \nSpain, also delivered good results as it emerged from \nthe pandemic, and is sharing its expertise with other \naged care businesses in the Group. We believe we \nhave the right strategies in place to turn around our \nUK dental and Australian aged care businesses. The \nBoard is particularly focused on addressing workforce \npressures in these Business Units. The Audit Committee \nhas reviewed the relevant accounting judgements that \narise as a result of the performance of these businesses \nin detail and more information can be found in its report \non page 67. The Risk Committee has also closely \nmonitored the risks to the execution and achievement \nof our strategy and ensuring that change happens \nwithin a suitable control framework. More detail \ncan be found in its report on page 73. \nSupporting our customers \nDuring the year, the Board, and a specially constituted \ncommittee of the Board, endorsed a series of proposals \nfrom our Australian Health Insurance business as part \nof Bupa’s commitment to not profit from COVID-19 \nand return related savings to customers, through a \ncombination of deferral of premium increases and \nreturns of cash to eligible customers. The total \nvalue of this support for customers during 2022 was \nAUD$536m. The total level of financial assistance \nto Australian Health Insurance customers since the \npandemic started now totals over AUD$875m. \nThe Board is proud of our colleagues in Poland for the \nsupport they are providing to Ukrainian refugees. This \nwill continue to be funded for as long as needed. \nSupporting our people \nOur people are the driving force behind our business \nso we need to take care of them so that they can \nalso enjoy longer, healthier, happier lives. The Board \nreceives regular updates on people-related matters, \nincluding the results of our People Pulse surveys, \nwellbeing, health and safety updates, and talent \nand succession planning. \nIñaki Ereño is passionate about looking after our people \nand has been the driving force behind the project to \nprovide, for the first time in our history, healthcare \nbenefits to all of Bupa’s employees globally by the end \nof 2023, to support their health and wellbeing. This \ninitiative, called Viva, is fully supported by the Board \nand really demonstrates our purpose in action. More \ndetail can be found in the Section 172 statement on \npage 36 and the People and Culture section on page 18. \nThe Risk Committee has closely monitored current \nworkforce risks, such as the ability to recruit and retain \nsufficient staff with the right skill sets and capacity and \nresilience pressures on our workforce, and provided \nregular updates to the Board on this. These issues have \nalso been monitored through People updates to the \nBoard from the Chief Sustainability and People Officer. \nThe cost of living has increased disproportionately \naround the world in recent months, creating a cost \nof living crisis for many people, including within our\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BUPA<|><|>Bupa is a global healthcare group involved in health insurance, aged care, and healthcare services, focusing on strategy, innovation, and supporting health and wellbeing of its customers and employees)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INAKI EREÑO<|><|>PERSON<|>Iñaki Ereño is a key executive at Bupa, responsible for initiatives like providing healthcare benefits to employees worldwide and leading strategic projects)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POLAND<|><|>GEO<|>Poland is a country where Bupa colleagues support Ukrainian refugees, demonstrating corporate social responsibility)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUSTRALIA<|><|>GEO<|>Australia is a country where Bupa's health insurance business provided financial support to customers during COVID-19, totaling AUD$875m since the pandemic began)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPAIN<|><|>GEO<|>Spain is home to Sanitas Mayores, an aged care business in the Bupa group that delivered strong results post-pandemic and shares expertise within the group)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UK<|><|>GEO<|>United Kingdom is a country where Bupa aims to turn around its dental business as part of its strategic focus)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUSTRALIA<|><|>GEO<|>Australia is also a focus for Bupa's aged care business, with efforts to improve performance and address workforce pressures)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Ukrainian refugees<|><|>PERSON<|>Ukrainian refugees are supported by Bupa colleagues in Poland, reflecting the company's commitment to social support)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOARD<|><|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Bupa Board oversees strategy, risk management, customer support, and employee wellbeing initiatives, including regular briefings and strategic reviews)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOARD COMMITTEES<|><|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Board’s Committees, including the Audit and Risk Committees, review financial judgements, monitor risks, and ensure strategy execution)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BUPA<|>INAKI EREÑO<|>Iñaki Ereño is a leader at Bupa responsible for healthcare benefits and strategic initiatives<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BUPA<|>POLAND<|>Bupa supports Ukrainian refugees in Poland, demonstrating corporate social responsibility<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BUPA<|>AUSTRALIA<|>Bupa's Australian health insurance provided financial support to customers during COVID-19<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BUPA<|>SPAIN<|>Sanitas Mayores in Spain is part of Bupa and has delivered strong post-pandemic results<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BUPA<|>UK<|>Bupa aims to improve its dental business in the UK<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BUPA<|>AUSTRALIA<|>Bupa is working to improve aged care performance in Australia<|>5)\n##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
