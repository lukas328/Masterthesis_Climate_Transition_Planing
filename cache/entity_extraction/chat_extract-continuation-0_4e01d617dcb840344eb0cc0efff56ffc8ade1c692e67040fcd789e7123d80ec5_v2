Goods and \nservices are distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations in the contract if \nthe customer can benefit from them either on their own or together with other resources that \nare readily available to the customer and they are separately identifiable in the contract. \nThe group typically sells licences to its intellectual property together with other goods and \nservices and, since these licences are not generally distinct in the context of the contract, \nrevenue recognition is considered at the level of the performance obligation of which the \nlicence forms part. Revenue in respect of performance obligations containing bundles of \ngoods and services in which a licence with a sales or usage-based royalty is the predominant \nitem is recognised when sales or usage occur. \nTransaction price \nAt the start of the contract, the total transaction price is estimated as the amount of \nconsideration to which the group expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring the \npromised goods and services to the customer, excluding sales taxes. Variable consideration, \nsuch as trade discounts, is included based on the expected value or most likely amount only to \nthe extent that it is highly probable that there will not be a reversal in the amount of \ncumulative revenue recognised. The transaction price does not include estimates of \nconsideration resulting from contract modifications until they have been approved by the \nparties to the contract. The total transaction price is allocated to the performance obligations \nidentified in the contract in proportion to their relative stand-alone selling prices. Many of the \ngroup's and parent company’s products and services are bespoke in nature and, therefore, \nstand-alone selling prices are estimated based on cost plus margin or by reference to market \ndata for similar products and services. \nRevenue recognition \nRevenue is recognised as performance obligations are satisfied as control of the goods and \nservices is transferred to the customer. \nFor each performance obligation within a contract, the group and parent company determine \nwhether it is satisfied over time or at a point in time. Performance obligations are satisfied \nover time if one of the following criteria is satisfied: \n• the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the group’s \nand parent company’s performance as they perform; \n• the group’s and parent company’s performance creates or enhances an asset that the \ncustomer controls as the asset is created or enhanced; or \n• the group’s and parent company’s performance does not create an asset with an alternative \nuse to the group and parent company and they have an enforceable right to payment for \nperformance completed to date. \nFor more detail of our revenue recognition policy see note 3. \nIn the event that the group and parent company enter into bill-and-hold transactions at the \nspecific request of customers, revenue is recognised when the goods are ready for transfer to \nthe customer and when the group and parent company are no longer capable of directing \nthose goods to another use.  \nRevenue includes sales of precious metal to customers and the precious metal content of \nproducts sold to customers. \nLinked contracts under which the group and parent company sell or buy precious metal and \ncommit to repurchase or sell the metal in the future are accounted for as finance transactions \nand no revenue is recognised in respect of the sale leg. \nNo revenue is recognised by the group or parent company in respect of non-monetary \nexchanges of precious metal on the basis that the counterparties are in the same line \nof business. \nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 2023 151\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION\nNotes on the Accounts continued for the year ended 31st March 2023 \n152 \n1 Accounting policies continued \nSignificant accounting policies continued \nConsideration payable to customers \nConsideration payable to customers in advance of the recognition of revenue in respect of the \ngoods and services to which it relates is capitalised and recognised as a deduction to the \nrevenue recognised upon transfer of the goods and services to the customer.  \nCosts to fulfil a contract  \nContract fulfilment costs in respect of over time contracts are expensed as incurred. Contract \nfulfilment costs in respect of point in time contracts are accounted for under IAS 2, \nInventories. \nContract receivables \nContract receivables represent amounts for which the group and parent company have an \nunconditional right to consideration in respect of unbilled revenue recognised at the balance \nsheet date. \nContract liabilities \nContract liabilities represent the obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for \nwhich consideration has been received, or consideration is due, from the customer. \nFinance costs and investment income \nFinance costs that are directly attributable to the construction of an asset that necessarily \ntakes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use are capitalised as part of the \ncost of that asset. Other finance costs and finance income are recognised in the income \nstatement in the year incurred. \nResearch and development \nResearch expenditure is charged to the income statement in the year incurred. Development \nexpenditure is charged to the income statement in the year incurred unless it meets the \nrecognition criteria for capitalisation. When the recognition criteria have been met, any \nfurther development expenditure is capitalised as an intangible asset. \nProperty, plant and equipment \nProperty, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any \nprovisions for impairment. Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write-off the cost less \nestimated residual value of each asset over its useful life and is recognised within \nadministrative expenses. Certain buildings and plant and equipment are depreciated using the \nunits of production method as this more closely reflects their expected consumption. All other \nassets are depreciated using the straight-line method. The useful lives vary according to the \nclass of the asset, but are typically: \n• buildings – 30 years; and \n• plant and machinery – 4 to 10\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>JOHNSON MATTHEY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Johnson Matthey is a global specialty chemicals company that produces and supplies precious metals, catalysts, and other advanced materials, and publishes annual reports including financial and strategic information)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2023<|>EVENT<|>The document is Johnson Matthey's official annual report for the year ending 31st March 2023, detailing financial performance, accounting policies, and strategic information)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CUSTOMER<|>PERSON<|>The customer is the recipient of goods and services, with contractual rights and obligations related to revenue recognition)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOHNSON MATTHEY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Johnson Matthey sells licenses to its intellectual property along with other goods and services, and recognizes revenue based on performance obligations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REVENUE<|>EVENT<|>Revenue is recognized when performance obligations are satisfied, based on sales or usage of goods and services)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRANSACTION PRICE<|>EVENT<|>The total consideration expected by Johnson Matthey in exchange for transferring goods and services, excluding sales taxes, used for revenue recognition and allocation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS<|>EVENT<|>Obligations that Johnson Matthey must fulfill to transfer goods or services to the customer, recognized over time or at a point in time)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONTRACT<|>EVENT<|>Legal agreement between Johnson Matthey and the customer outlining the sale of goods/services and related terms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Assets used in Johnson Matthey's operations, stated at cost less depreciation, including buildings and machinery)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Activities aimed at developing new products or improving existing ones, with expenditure charged to income unless capitalized)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONTRACT RECEIVABLES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Amounts Johnson Matthey has a right to receive for unbilled revenue recognized at the balance sheet date)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONTRACT LIABILITIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Obligations Johnson Matthey has to transfer goods or services for which consideration has been received or is due)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FINANCE COSTS<|>EVENT<|>Costs related to financing activities, capitalized if attributable to construction of assets, otherwise recognized in income)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REVENUE RECOGNITION<|>EVENT<|>The process by which Johnson Matthey recognizes revenue as control of goods/services is transferred to the customer)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SALES AND USAGE-BASED ROYALTIES<|>EVENT<|>Type of revenue where royalties are recognized when sales or usage occur, with license being the predominant item)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BESPOKE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Custom-made products/services with estimated stand-alone prices based on cost plus margin or market data)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COST PLUS MARGIN<|>EVENT<|>Method used to estimate stand-alone selling prices for bespoke products/services)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ACCOUNTING POLICIES<|>EVENT<|>Johnson Matthey's policies on revenue recognition, property, plant and equipment, research, and development, among others)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAPITALIZED DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Development costs that meet recognition criteria are capitalized as intangible assets)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEPRECIATION<|>EVENT<|>Systematic allocation of the cost of property, plant, and equipment over their useful lives, using straight-line or units of production methods)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>USEFUL LIVES<|>EVENT<|>Estimated periods over which assets like buildings (30 years) and machinery (4-10 years) are depreciated)\n##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
