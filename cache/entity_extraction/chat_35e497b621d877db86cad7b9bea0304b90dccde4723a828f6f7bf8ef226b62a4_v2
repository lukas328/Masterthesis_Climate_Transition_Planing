In Australia, a deferred \nclaims provision is held due to regulatory \ncommitments to fund the deferred medical \nservice, even if the service were to postdate \na customer’s contract period. \nThis deferred claim provision is held on a best \nestimate basis (plus a margin for prudence) and \nrepresents the estimated cost of claims that are \nexpected to rebound after the reporting date. \nThe key assumption used to calculate the \ndeferred claims provision is the deferral rate \nfor six months of claims. \nThe work performed to address the valuation of \nprovisions for insurance contracts included the \nfollowing procedures: \n▪ Understood and evaluated the processes and \ncontrols in place to determine the provisions \nfor claims; \n▪ Tested the design and operating effectiveness \nof controls in place over provisions for claims, \nincluding those covering the approval of \nassumptions and completeness and accuracy \nof data used; \n▪ Using our actuarial specialists, we: \n▪ Applied our industry knowledge and \nexperience and compared the methodology, \nmodels and assumptions used against \nrecognised actuarial practices; \n▪ Evaluated the key assumptions used in \nthe valuation of provisions for claims for \nreasonableness compared to historic \nexperience, including the impact of inflation; \n▪ Performed independent re-projections for \n49% of provisions for claims, comparing our \nestimated provisions to those booked by \nmanagement, and investigated differences, \nwhere material; \n▪ Evaluated the methodology and assumptions \napplied by management for a further 40% of \nprovisions for claims, including reperforming \nmanagement’s calculations and performing \nsensitivities to determine if the assumptions \nused were reasonable; and \n▪ For the remaining provision performed a \ndiagnostic check to identify and investigate \nany anomalies. \n▪ Evaluated the methodology and assumptions \nused by management in calculating the \ndeferred claims provision, including the \nassumed deferral rate; and \n▪ Assessed whether the disclosures related to \ninsurance contract liabilities, including the \ndeferred claims provision, are compliant with \nthe applicable financial reporting standards. \nBased on the procedures performed and the \nevidence obtained, we consider the valuation of \nthe insurance contract liabilities to be appropriate. \nBupa Annual Report 2022 111 \n  \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n   \n     \n  \n  \n        \n      \n       \n       \n        \n      \n    \n \n      \n      \n       \n       \n         \n     \n     \n      \n      \n       \n      \n      \n       \n        \n     \n  \n      \n    \n     \n      \n       \n         \n     \n       \n      \n      \n  \n \n      \n      \n      \n     \n         \n      \n        \n     \n     \n \n       \n      \n \n      \n       \n      \n  \n      \n      \n       \n      \n     \n     \n     \n       \n        \n       \n       \n       \n     \n        \n \n      \n     \n       \n  \n     \n       \n      \n  \n       \n       \n       \n         \n          \n      \n      \n   \nStrategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements \nIndependent auditors’ report to the members of \nThe British United Provident Association Limited \ncontinued \nKey audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter \nValuation of \nfreehold \nproperty and \ninvestment \nproperty (Group) \nRefer to Audit \nCommittee \nReport and Notes \n1.3, 4 and 5 (for \naccounting policy \nand financial \ndisclosures) \nThe Group holds freehold property (see Note 4 \nProperty, plant and equipment) and investment \nproperty (see Note 5 Investment property).
