We will look to increase \nour allocation of policyholder assets to climate \nsolution funds over the course of 2023  \nand beyond.\nInvestments in venture capital funds\nWe have a dedicated venture capital fund with  \nan initial allocation in excess of £100 million.  \nThe fund will follow a thematic ESG approach \nwithin a number of sectors, including Green \nEnergy, Fintech and Healthcare, to provide \nattractive risk-adjusted returns. We will look to \nincrease our allocation of funds to venture capital \nas opportunities arise to scale the low carbon \ntechnology companies of the future.\nDirect investment\nOur ambition is to deploy £10 billion in direct \ninvestments in sustainable assets by year end 2025 \nand further scale up investments in climate \nsolutions as part of broader goal to invest up to \n£40bn in sustainable and productive assets \ndependent on favourable policy, regulatory and \nmarket landscape.
