We’re clear \nthat we will continue to fund this support for as long \nas needed. \nIn last year’s Chairman’s statement, I noted Bupa’s \nparticular focus on sustainability in the new strategy. \nIn 2022, we launched a new sustainability strategy \nthrough which Bupa will deliver the commitment to \n“make a better world” which we added to our purpose \nin 2021. Our approach to sustainability is focused on \nthe intersection of human health and the health of the \nplanet. This strategy has given us clear direction with \nambitious sustainability goals. \nWe are confident that the prospects are good but \nwe recognise that we continue to face risks and \nchallenges. The ever-increasing public focus on health \nand wellbeing provides us with opportunities to meet \nchanging customer needs. We’re making good progress \non our ambitious strategy and I have every confidence \nthat what the team are doing under Iñaki’s leadership \nwill position Bupa as the “go to” place for healthcare \nacross the world. \nOur Strategic Report from pages 1-48 was reviewed and \napproved by the Board of Directors on 1 March 2023. \nBy order of the Board. \nRoger Davis \nGroup Chairman \nBupa Annual Report 2022 5 \n     \n       \n       \n         \n     \n        \n       \n          \n         \n         \n        \n         \n      \n   \n       \n      \n       \n         \n       \n      \n       \n         \n        \n      \n        \n      \n          \n       \n        \n         \n          \n       \n        \n         \n        \n        \n       \n       \n        \n \n       \n        \n        \n      \n      \n        \n       \n        \n       \n          \n      \n         \n       \n       \n       \n   \n      \n         \n        \n         \n         \n         \n      \n   \n           \n         \n        \n        \n        \n         \n         \n        \n        \n         \n           \n        \n        \n       \n           \n          \n      \n \n        \n       \n       \n         \n         \n        \n        \n       \n       \n          \n         \n        \n       \n       \n        \n           \n       \n      \n          \n       \n           \n       \n     \n \n \n          \n  \n   \nStrategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements \nGroup CEO’s review \nThese results demonstrate positive underlying \nperformance across the Group in a challenging \neconomic environment. We are making good progress \nimplementing the new 3x6 strategy and our focus on \ndriving significant transformation around digitalisation \nand customer service improvements has led to good \norganic customer growth in several businesses. As \nwell as being the first full year of implementation of \nthe new strategy, 2022 was also a significant year \nfor Bupa as we celebrated our 75th anniversary. \nThe increase in both our revenue and underlying \nprofit as a result of strong customer demand \ndemonstrates this progress, with strong insurance \ncustomer volume growth. \nThe large statutory loss arising from goodwill \nimpairments is disappointing, however, and reflects \ndifferent factors. Global inflation has risen sharply \ndriven by the aftermath of the pandemic and the \ninvasion of Ukraine. Global markets responded by \nincreasing central bank rates leading to increasing \nand more volatile bond yields causing interest rates \nto rise sharply during the second half of 2022. This \nled to significant increases in the cost of capital \nof our businesses, impacting the carrying value. \nIn addition to this macro-economic impact, in UK \nDental, operational challenges increased further during \nthe second half of the year, in particular below target \nrecruitment and retention of clinicians and increasing \nwage and energy costs, resulting in lower projected \ncash flows. A strategic review was initiated and new \nleadership was put in place. In Chile, the Isapre industry \nhas been negatively impacted by judicialisation of \npremium pricing and regulatory action leading us to \nreassess our expectations of future cash flow from our \nIsapre business. In Australian aged care, we have \nreassessed our expectations of future cash flows to \nmake an allowance for implementing the expected \nimpact of mandatory care minutes for residents \nand future reform of government residential aged \ncare funding. \nOur underlying performance, together with the quality \nof growth we are achieving across multiple businesses, \ngives us confidence for the future. Our portfolio \nmanagement approach is delivering results, particularly \nin recovering performance in Bupa Global. \nWe are pleased with the continued strong growth \nacross health insurance in multiple countries, including \nAustralia, Spain, UK, Poland, Brazil and Türkiye. We \nbelieve this demonstrates how our customers continue \nto see the value of our services, even in a cost-\nconstrained environment. We are also working \nhard to meet customers' changing expectations of \nhealthcare and we continued to make significant \nprogress in our digital transformation journey with \nfurther implementation of our digital platform, Blua, \nacross different markets. \nRising demand for healthcare and post-pandemic \nrecovery are also reflected in the growth across our \nhealth provision businesses, as we served two million \nmore customers than in 2021. In aged care, occupancy \nimproved in Spain and the UK, while occupancy was \ndown in Australia and New Zealand as these businesses \ncontinued to navigate challenges from COVID-19 \nimpacts and workforce availability. \nIt is a challenging time for our employees due to the \nincreased cost of living. We are focused on helping \nour customer-facing colleagues, in particular, and have \nprovided support which has varied according to local \nmarkets. We’ve also just announced a broader package \nof health and wellbeing initiatives, Viva, to help our \npeople worldwide and this will be rolled out across \nBupa this year. Our thoughts are with everyone \nimpacted by the tragic recent earthquakes in Türkiye \nand Syria. As the recovery efforts continue, our team \nin Türkiye has been working hard on a support package \nfor those in need, including customers and colleagues. \nThrough our business in Poland, we have been\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
