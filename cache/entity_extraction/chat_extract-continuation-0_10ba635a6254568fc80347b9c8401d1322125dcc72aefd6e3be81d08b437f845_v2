The hourly pension plan \nremains open to future accrual for existing members but the salaried pension plan will be \nclosed to future accrual from 1st July 2023 with plan participants transferring to a defined \ncontribution plan. All new US employees now join a defined contribution plan. \nOther post-employment benefits \nThe group’s principal post-employment medical plans are in the UK and US, and are unfunded \narrangements that have been closed to new entrants for over ten years. \nMaturity profile \nThe estimated weighted average durations of the defined benefit obligations of the main \nplans as at 31st March 2023 are: \n \nWeighted average \nduration\nYears \nPensions: \nUK 16\nUS 10\nPost-retirement medical benefits: \nUK 9\nUS 9\nFunding \nIntroduction \nThe group’s principal defined benefit retirement plans are funded through separate fiduciary \nor trustee administered funds that are independent of the sponsoring company. The \ncontributions paid to these arrangements are jointly agreed by the sponsoring company and \nthe relevant trustee or fiduciary body after each funding valuation and in consultation with \nindependent qualified actuaries. The plans’ assets, together with the agreed funding \ncontributions, should be sufficient to meet the plans’ future pension obligations. \nUK valuations \nUK legislation requires that pension plans are funded prudently and that, when undertaking a \nfunding valuation (every three years), assets are taken at their market value and liabilities are \ndetermined based on a set of prudent assumptions set by the trustee following consultation \nwith their appointed actuary. The assumptions used for funding valuations may, therefore, \ndiffer to the actuarial assumptions used for IAS 19, Employee Benefits, accounting purposes. \nIn January 2013, a special purpose vehicle (SPV), Johnson Matthey (Scotland) Limited \nPartnership, was set up to provide deficit reduction contributions and greater security to the \ntrustee. The group invested £50 million in a bond portfolio which is beneficially held by the \nSPV. The income generated by the SPV is used to make annual distributions of £3.5 million to \nJMEPS for a period of up to 25 years. These annual distributions are only payable if the legacy \nsection of JMEPS continues to be in deficit, on a funding basis. This bond portfolio is held as a \nnon-current investment at fair value through other comprehensive income and the group’s \nliability to pay the income to the plan is not a plan asset under IAS 19 although it is for \nactuarial funding valuation purposes. The SPV is exempt from the requirement to prepare \naudited annual accounts as it is included on a consolidated basis in these accounts.  \nA funding valuation of JMEPS was carried out as at 1st April 2021 and showed that there was a \ndeficit of £9 million in the legacy section of the plan, or a surplus of £24 million after taking \naccount of the future additional deficit contributions from the SPV. The valuation also showed \na deficit in the cash balance section of the plan of £1 million. The next triennial actuarial \nvaluation of JMEPS will be carried out as at 1st April 2024 with the results known later in \nthe year. \nIn accordance with the governing documentation of JMEPS, any future plan surplus would be \nreturned to the parent company by way of a refund assuming gradual settlement of the \nliabilities over the lifetime of the plan. As such, there are no adjustments required in respect of \nIFRIC 14, IAS 19 – The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and \ntheir Interaction. \nUS valuations \nThe last annual review of the US defined benefit pension plans was carried out by a qualified \nactuary as at 1st July 2021 and showed that there was a surplus of $10 million on the projected \nfunding basis.  \nThe assumptions used for funding valuations may differ to the actuarial assumptions used for \nIAS 19 accounting purposes. \nOther valuations \nSimilar funding valuations are undertaken on the group’s other defined benefit pension plans \noutside of the UK and US in accordance with prevailing local legislation. \n \nNotes on the Accounts continued for the year ended 31st March 2023 \n \n185 \n24 Post-employment benefits continued \nGroup continued \nRisk management \nThe group is exposed to a number of risks relating to its post-retirement pension plans, the most significant of which are: \nRisk Mitigation \nMarket (investment) risk  \nAsset returns may not move in line with the liabilities and may be subject to volatility. The group’s various plans have highly diversified investment portfolios, investing in a wide range of assets \nthat provide reasonable assurance that no single security or type of security could have a material adverse \nimpact on the plan. \nA de-risking strategy is in place to reduce volatility in the plans as a result of the mismatch between the assets \nand liabilities. As the funding level of the plans improve and hit pre-agreed triggers, plan investments are \nswitched from return-seeking assets to liability-matching assets.  \nThe plans implement partial currency hedging on their overseas assets to mitigate currency risk. \nInterest (discount) rate risk  \nLiabilities are sensitive to movements in bond yields (interest rates), with lower \ninterest rates leading to an increase in the valuation of liabilities, albeit the impact \non\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>UNITED STATES<|><geo><|>The US is a country with various pension plans, including salaried and hourly pension plans, and post-employment medical benefits, with specific plans closed or open to new entrants and future accruals)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOHNSON MATTHEY (SCOTLAND) LIMITED PARTNERSHIP<|><organization><|>A special purpose vehicle (SPV) established in Scotland to provide deficit reduction contributions and security to the UK pension plan, investing in bonds and making annual distributions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JMEPS<|><organization><|>The Johnson Matthey Employee Pension Scheme (JMEPS) is a pension plan with a deficit of £9 million as of April 2021, and a surplus of £24 million after contributions from the SPV, involved in funding and deficit management)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UK<|><geo><|>The United Kingdom hosts principal post-employment medical plans and pension plans, with specific legislation and valuation processes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCOTLAND<|><geo><|>A region within the UK where Johnson Matthey (Scotland) Limited Partnership is based and where some pension activities are managed)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AURELIA<|><geo><|>A country seeking to manage its post-employment benefits and pension plans, mentioned in context of international operations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UK<|><geo><|>The UK is involved in pension plan funding, valuation, and legislation, with specific mention of the UK pension plan durations and regulations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>US<|><geo><|>The United States hosts its own defined benefit pension plans, with recent valuations showing a surplus of $10 million as of July 2021, and specific post-employment benefits)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JMEPS<|><organization><|>The Johnson Matthey Employee Pension Scheme, a UK pension plan with funding and deficit/surplus details, involved in pension funding and valuation activities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Post-employment medical plans<|><organization><|>Medical benefit plans in the UK and US, unfunded, closed to new entrants for over ten years, providing post-retirement benefits to members)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Johnson Matthey<|><organization><|>A global organization involved in pension plans, post-employment benefits, and managing pension fund assets and liabilities)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOHNSON MATTHEY<|>JMEPS<|>Johnson Matthey manages and funds the JMEPS pension plan<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JOHNSON MATTHEY<|>SCOTLAND<|>Johnson Matthey (Scotland) Limited Partnership is a UK-based SPV supporting pension deficit reduction<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JMEPS<|>UK<|>JMEPS is a UK pension plan subject to UK legislation and valuation processes<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JMEPS<|>JOHNSON MATTHEY<|>JMEPS is managed and funded by Johnson Matthey<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>US<|>JOHNSON MATTHEY<|>Johnson Matthey operates US pension plans with specific valuations and surplus/deficit statuses<|>7)\n##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
