Scope 3 emissions for the remaining 12% lending were estimated \nbased on their relative exposure.\ni. Well-to-tank emissions result from the production, processing, and delivery of fuel before combustion in an \nautomobile engine.\nii. Tank-to-wheel emissions relate to the combustion of fuel in an automobile’s engine, released directly at the \ntailpipe of the vehicle.\n • Both well-to-tank and tank-to-wheel emissions are estimated for Scope 3 emissions as both sets of activities are \nrequired for the automobile to operate. As noted previously, estimation of Scope 3 emissions, particularly within \nthe oil and gas, transportation, and automotive sectors, introduces the potential for double counting of emissions.\nWe used the IEA ETP B2DS World scenario to estimate the physical emissions intensity reduction of 24% required by \n2030, validated by the SBTi as science-based. Key assumptions underlying the pathway are the electrification process \nof passenger travel and assumed decrease in demand for passenger travel and long-term emissions reduction due \nto the use of alternative energy carriers.

Since 2019, absolute emissions \nreduced by 26% while emissions intensity increased across freight toad, passenger rail and passenger road.\nSeparate scenarios have been used for subsectors within the land transport sector, to reflect different metrics \nand underlying variables. Reductions of 19% on freight road transport, 42% on passenger rail transport and 31% \non passenger road transport are required to align to the IEA ETP B2DS World scenario.
