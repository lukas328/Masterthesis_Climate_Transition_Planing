Each sector alliance establishes the \ncommitment criteria for membership. Commitments \ninclude achieving net zero by 2050 at the latest \nand setting interim targets for 2030 reflecting \nmaximum effort toward a fair share of the 50% \nglobal reduction in GHG emissions needed by 2030. \nCommitment criteria are understood differently \nby each sectoral alliance comprising GFANZ, as \neach sector has different functions and roles in the \nfinancial system. In particular, for institutions \nacting as fiduciaries to their beneficiaries, the scope \nof financing services and products may be reliant \non financial risks associated with transition to net \nzero. This framework can be helpful to develop \nand implement net-zero transition plans in line with \nthese timelines and commitments. Other financial \ninstitutions may find this report useful whether  \nthey have yet to publicly commit to net zero or  \nif they have net-zero targets beyond 2050. These \ninstitutions are encouraged to prioritize near-term \naction and ground their transition planning  \nprocess in climate science and pathways aligned  \nto 1.5 degrees C. \nThe recommendations in this report build on the \nwork of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial \nDisclosures63 (TCFD); guidance and insights \ndeveloped by the sector-specific net-zero alliances; \nresearch from non-government organizations \n(NGOs), scientists, academics, industry, and other \ntechnical experts; and learnings from financial \ninstitutions that have already developed transition \nplans.64 GFANZ is grateful to the wide range of \norganizations referenced in this report that have \ndeveloped guidance and other resources to \nsupport the critical work of transition planning.\nCONTENTS  |  FINANCIAL INSTITUTION NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLANS — FUNDAMENTALS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND GUIDANCE\n17\nBOX 3. BUILDING ON TCFD: CLIMATE-RELATED FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE, AND NET-ZERO PLANS\nThe TCFD provides important, widely-accepted recommendations and implementing guidelines for \ndisclosing climate-related financial information. The TCFD recommends companies, including financial \ninstitutions, describe how resilient their strategies are to climate-related risks and opportunities —\nincluding those related to physical climate impacts and impacts of the transition to a lower-carbon \neconomy — by leveraging a set of climate-related scenarios. Scenario analysis can help companies \nframe and assess the potential range of plausible business, strategic, and financial impacts from \nclimate change and the associated management actions that may need to be considered in strategic \nand financial plans. Net-zero transition planning describes how strategies will support 1.5 degrees C  \nalignment, accelerating the transition to a net-zero global economy and thereby minimizing the \nlikelihood of increasing climate  impacts.\nIn October 2021, the TCFD published additional guidance on disclosing climate-related metrics and \ntargets and key information from transition plans for all sectors, noting that “organizations’ transition \nplans are of particular interest to users (e.g., investors, lenders, and insurance underwriters), especially \nwhen they are seeking to verify the credibility of organizations’ commitments related to climate \nchange.”65, 66 The Task Force’s guidance — intended to cover a wide range of organizations — provides \nhigh-level information on considerations for transition plans and key information to disclose. As such, \nthe guidance does not provide transition plan guidance specific to the financial sector or address how \nfirms can develop and implement these plans. \nThis report complements the TCFD guidance on transition plans by presenting recommendations \nand guidance for financial institutions to develop and execute on net-zero transition plans. A net-zero \ntransition plan has a specific, forward-looking objective: to support global efforts to limit temperature \nincreases to 1.5 degrees C and reach net-zero emissions by 2050. In doing so, it also serves to \nprovide details on how an organization is working to mitigate the transition risk it faces. For financial \ninstitutions, a net-zero transition plan should build on its TCFD-related or other climate-related \ndisclosure work. The plan should use findings from its scenario analysis to detail the business levers \nthe institution will use to achieve goals around both emissions reduction and transition risk mitigation \nand, therefore, ultimately contribute to addressing systemic climate risk. \nGFANZ recognizes that transition plan disclosure provides transparency and enhances the credibility \nof financial institutions’ net-zero transition efforts and, collectively, those of the financial sector. \nGFANZ has provided suggestions on what this disclosure might include but recognizes that \ndeveloping detailed recommendations for disclosure requires a separate effort to properly consider \nmore detailed disclosure guidance than what is covered in this report.\n65 TCFD. 2021 Status Report , October 2021.\n66 TCFD.
