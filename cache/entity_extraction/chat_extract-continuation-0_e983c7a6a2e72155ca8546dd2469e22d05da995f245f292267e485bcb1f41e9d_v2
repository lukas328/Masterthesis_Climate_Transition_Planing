It is therefore likely the economic impact of the scenarios could be more severe if applied on top of the \ncurrently elevated energy prices. This supports our conclusion that climate risk could amplify other risk types, e.g. \ncredit risk.\nNote: Other contains the following sectors: water and waste, mining and metals, construction, and buildings materials\nPhoto credit:   \n60NatWest Group plc | 2022 Climate-related Disclosures Report\nGovernance Strategy and Climate transition plan Risk Management and Scenario Analysis Metrics and TargetsIntroduction\nScenario Analysis continued\nRetail physical risk insights\nPhysical risk outcomes (No Additional Action scenario):\nFor residential mortgage exposures, flooding is the key direct physical risk and is focused on specific geographic locations. \nWhile NatWest Group modelled higher flood risk in Scotland and Wales, NatWest Group’s exposure profile resulted in the \ngreatest impairment rates in the South East and West of England. Overall, for NatWest Group’s residential mortgage \nportfolio, the proportion of properties at high and very high risk is relatively low at 3.0% – see section 5.2. However, the \nNo Additional Action scenario also impacted the entire portfolio through assumed slower economic growth and slower \nhouse price growth at a national level when compared to the counterfactual scenario.\nIn the No Additional Action scenario, we observed that the impact on property values at a portfolio level is minimal. \nHowever, although a small proportion of the portfolio is in high flood risk banding, these properties incur significant \nimpairments. This is particularly notable for properties currently protected by Flood Re as these properties see significant \nincreases in risk as Flood Re is expected to exit the market in 2039. As previously noted, we continue to develop our \nphysical risk modelling and data, including exploring physical perils beyond flood and subsidence. \nWholesale physical risk insights\nPhysical risk outcomes (No Additional Action scenario):\nThe graph below provides details on potential cumulative impairments in the No Additional Action scenario for selected \nsectors. When compared to the graph on the previous page, this shows that in all sectors the No Additional Action \nscenario produced impairments that are less severe relative to the Early Action and Late Action transition risk scenarios. \nAgriculture and commercial real estate saw the largest impact from the No Additional Action scenario relative to the \ncounterfactual, this was driven by the assumed slower growth in property values in the macroeconomic assumptions, \nand chronic physical risk impacts.\nNote: Other contains the following sectors: oil and gas, power utilities, industrials and land transport and logistics.\nThe geographic concentration of NatWest Group’s book, primarily in the UK, is expected to limit the overall exposure to \nphysical risks over the projection period, relative to other regions. However, it is important to note that the No Additional \nAction scenario does not capture the severe implications of unmitigated climate change. For example, increased \ngeopolitical risk, migration, and severe disruption to global supply chains. In addition, there are known challenges and \nlimitations with the methodology, which NatWest Group is looking to address, for example through event-based physical \nrisk analysis. \nAgr/uni0069culture Automot/uni0069ve Commerc/uni0069al\nreal estate\nConstruct/uni0069on Other\n2,500\n0\n2050 No Add/uni0069t/uni0069onal Act/uni0069on Cumulat/uni0069ve Imp (£m)\nIn 2022 we conducted high level research on the macroeconomic impact of severe global physical events \n(acute physical risk) and concluded they were less material in the short-term for our portfolio than potential \ntransition effects, hence prioritising the development of our Transition Risk Calculator. Nevertheless, \nphysical risk remains an important focus area and we are continuing our analysis with the view to overcome \nthe data challenges and incorporate the effects explicitly in the macroeconomic scenarios.\nIn conclusion, our climate scenario analysis carried out to support our participation in the CBES exercise has \nprovided useful insights that we incorporated in our work on developing the first iteration of our Climate \ntransition plan, as well as the identification of heightened climate-related risk sectors. The conclusions support \nNatWest Group’s climate ambition set in 2020, to support customer transition, and provided input in our \nambition updates announced in February 2023. During 2023, we will continue to develop our climate scenario \nanalysis capabilities to embed into climate risk management.\nNo Additional Action Cumulative Impairments by Sector (£m)\n61NatWest Group plc | 2022 Climate-related Disclosures Report\nGovernance Strategy and Climate transition plan Risk Management and Scenario Analysis\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NATWEST GROUP PLC<|><organization<|>NATWEST GROUP PLC is a major UK-based banking and financial services organization actively involved in climate risk management and scenario analysis, as detailed in their 2022 Climate-related Disclosures Report)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCOTLAND<|><geo<|>Scotland is a geographic region in the UK where higher flood risk is modelled for residential mortgage exposures)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WALES<|><geo<|>Wales is a geographic region in the UK with modeled higher flood risk for residential properties)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOUTH EAST OF ENGLAND<|><geo<|>The South East of England is a geographic area with significant impairment rates in residential mortgage properties due to flood risk)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WEST OF ENGLAND<|><geo<|>The West of England is a geographic area with notable flood risk impacts on properties)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FLOOD RE<|><organization<|>Flood Re is an organization providing flood insurance protection for properties, with its exit expected in 2039 impacting flood risk management)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCOTLAND<|><geo<|>Scotland is a geographic region affected by physical flood risks in the context of climate scenario analysis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WATER AND WASTE<|><sector<|>Water and waste is a sector included under \"Other\" in the physical risk analysis, impacted by climate change effects)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MINING AND METALS<|><sector<|>Mining and metals is a sector analyzed for physical risks related to climate change impacts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONSTRUCTION<|><sector<|>Construction sector is part of the \"Other\" sectors impacted by physical risks and climate change scenarios)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUILDINGS MATERIALS<|><sector<|>Building materials sector is included in the physical risk impact analysis under \"Other\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>2050<|><event<|>The year 2050 is a key milestone in the climate scenario analysis, representing the target year for cumulative impact assessments)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EARLY ACTION<|><event<|>Early Action refers to proactive measures taken to mitigate climate transition risks, analyzed in the report)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LATE ACTION<|><event<|>Late Action refers to delayed mitigation efforts, contrasted with Early Action in the climate risk scenarios)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MACROECONOMIC IMPACT<|><event<|>The macroeconomic impact of severe physical events and climate change scenarios was studied to understand potential financial implications)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLIMATE TRANSITION PLAN<|><organization<|>The Climate Transition Plan is a strategic framework developed by NatWest Group to support customer transition and manage climate-related risks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCENARIO ANALYSIS<|><event<|>Scenario analysis is a methodological approach used by NatWest Group to evaluate potential future physical and transition risks related to climate change)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATWEST GROUP PLC<|>SCENARIO ANALYSIS<|>NatWest Group conducted scenario analysis to assess climate-related physical and transition risks<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FLOOD RE<|>SCOTLAND<|>Flood Re provides flood insurance coverage in Scotland, affecting flood risk assessments<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FLOOD RE<|>WALES<|>Flood Re provides flood insurance coverage in Wales, influencing flood risk modeling<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATWEST GROUP PLC<|>SCOTLAND<|>The geographic region of Scotland is modeled for flood risk impacts on mortgage exposures<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATWEST GROUP PLC<|>WATER AND WASTE<|>Water and waste sector is part of the physical risk sectors analyzed by NatWest Group<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATWEST GROUP PLC<|>MINING AND METALS<|>Mining and metals sector is included in physical risk impact assessments<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATWEST GROUP PLC<|>CONSTRUCTION<|>Construction sector is analyzed for physical risks in climate scenario analysis<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATWEST GROUP PLC<|>BUILDINGS MATERIALS<|>Building materials sector is part of the sectors impacted by physical risks<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>2050<|>SCENARIO ANALYSIS<|>The year 2050 is a key milestone for cumulative impact assessments in climate scenario analysis<|>7)\n##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
