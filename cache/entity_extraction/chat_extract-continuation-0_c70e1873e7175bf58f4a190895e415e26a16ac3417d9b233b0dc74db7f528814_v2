The \nImplementation Strategy recommendations focus on the products and services that are key to allocating \nand securing capital for emissions reduction in the real economy; the internal analytics and processes that \ndrive financing activity; and policies for financing climate-critical  activities.\n1) COMPONENT: PRODUCTS AND SERVICES\nRecommendation\nUse existing and new products and services \nto support and increase clients’ and portfolio \ncompanies’ efforts to transition in line with \n1.5 degrees C net-zero pathways. Include \naccelerating and scaling the net-zero transition \nin the real economy, providing transition-\nrelated education and advice, and supporting \nportfolio decarbonization in accordance with \nthe institution's net-zero transition strategy.\n \nOverview and relevance: Through its products \nand services, a financial institution can facilitate \nand accelerate GHG emissions reduction; signal \nto the real economy that transition strategies will \nbe supported with capital or insurance coverage; \nand educate clients, portfolio companies, and \nbroader society on the need for the net-zero \ntransition. To this end, financial institutions ' finance \nand investment vehicles, insurance products, and \nfinancial services can be aligned with the financial \ninstitution’s and their clients’ net-zero objectives.\n \n92 An example of a new product that covers this type of investment is the European Investment Bank’s Venture Debt to fill the \nfinancing market gap faced by high-growth, innovation-focused companies.\nGuidance: Financial institutions should assess \nwhether and how their existing products and \nservices support and de-risk the net-zero transition, \nwhether and how they could be modified to do so, \nand whether new “climate-aligned” products and \nservices are required. Where relevant (depending \non the institution’s business model), ensure that the \nsuite of products and services sufficiently supports \nreal-economy decarbonization and acceleration of \nclimate solutions.92 Products and services can be \ngeared to do the following:\n• Provide financing, investment, insurance, or other \nservices that support companies and activities \ndeveloping climate solutions or enabling \nthe net-zero transition (e.g., financing that is \nconditional on phaseout of high-emitting assets \nor partnerships with government to share risks \nacross the value chain; insurers could develop/\noffer insurance and reinsurance products and \nsolutions for low-emissions and zero-emissions \ntechnologies that enable capital flows). \n• Reduce portfolio or financed GHG emissions in \nalignment with a recognized decarbonization \npathway, or construct a portfolio that is geared  \n \n \n \n \n \nCONTENTS  |  FINANCIAL INSTITUTION NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLANS — FUNDAMENTALS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND GUIDANCE\n40\ntoward assets that have a clear transition \nplan in place (e.g., indices or funds based on \ntransition-aligned pathways, Outsourced Chief \nInvestment Officer (OCIO) services that include \ntransition considerations).\n• Educate and advise clients and counterparties \non the net-zero transition. Examples include \neducating small- and medium-sized businesses \non transition risks; educating clients on trade-\noffs, such as pursuing a low GHG footprint \nversus an overweight allocation to a low-\nemissions fund; insurance brokers could engage \nwith clients to help them take steps toward \nreducing their GHG emissions to be allowed \nto purchase a specific insurance policy; and \npension funds could educate their beneficiaries \non net zero-related considerations. \n93 GFANZ. Guidance on Use of Sectoral Pathways for Financial Institutions , 2022, and anticipated further work on sector-\nspecific pathways.\nBecause products and services are highly \nspecific to different financial institutions and \nmay span multiple business lines, an institution \nshould focus on products and services within \nits major areas of business (i.e., where it has \nsignificant influence, a large network, or greatest \npotential for decarbonization or real-economy \ntransition acceleration).\nWhen designing products and services, financial \ninstitutions should consider a few key aspects \nto ensure suitable alignment with 1.5 degrees C \npathways and the institution’s net-zero objectives \nand targets, as well as effective deployment. \nThe key aspects that form the conditions \naround the business relationship should be \nclearly communicated.\nTable 2.
