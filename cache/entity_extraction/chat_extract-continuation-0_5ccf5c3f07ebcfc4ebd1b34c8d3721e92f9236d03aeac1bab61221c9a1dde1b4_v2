Where possible, and given variable constraints on emissions data, calculations capture a \nbuilding’s energy consumption, but exclude all remaining value chain segments from scope (e.g., embodied \nemissions from construction, etc.).\nThe formula used to calculate a building’s operational emissions is as follows:\nThe financed emissions formula for the CRE Sector is as follows:\n \n with c = counterparty\nwith a = asset\nExternal Data Inputs for Commercial Real Estate\nCarbon Risk Real Estate Monitor (CRREM) Emissions Data\nBuilding emissions data was derived predominately from the CRREM module, which includes emissions \ninformation for approximately 11 different property types across 44 different countries. The data is derived \nfrom 2018 actual emissions, projecting emissions intensities until 2050 by property type and location. In the \nabsence of actual emissions, we leveraged a property and location crosswalk to triangulate the appropriate \nCRREM emissions factor by property type and location to apply against Gross Floor Area (GFA). This \napproach was used to determine the estimated building emissions of a property for the year 2020.\nCRREM does not segregate Scope 1 and 2 emissions from its intensity metrics. CRREM’s emissions factor \nincludes fugitive leaks, unlike other readily available emission factors. Further information on the CRREM \nMethodology can be sourced in their methodology documents11,12.\nTo validate CRREM emission disclosures, a comparison was performed using EPA emission factors derived \nfrom EIA CBECS and RECS consumption data. This comparison largely confirmed that estimated emissions \nleveraging CRREM in the U.S. were within range of the EIA’s database.\nThough CRE uses an asset level approach, to remain consistent with other sectors, GHG emissions are \npulled for CY2020. In FY2021, CRREM emissions for CY2020 were matched to all properties.\n10 Emission factors leveraged for the calculation include: CRREM and EIA/EPA. Both sources utilize property-specific and location-specific \nconsumption to triangulate an appropriate metric. \n11 CRREM Risk Assessment Reference Guide\n12 CRREM Downscaling and Assessment Methodology\nBuilding Operational Emissions XEmissions Factor(10) Gross Floor Area=\n=Financed Emissions ∑\nc\nCommitted Amountc\n∑ Value at Originationa\n∑\na\nX  (Gross Floor Areaa X Emissions Factor(10)\na )\nTCFD REPORT 2022: CITI’S APPROACH TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND NET ZERO | 77\nEIA Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) and Residential Energy Consumption \nSurvey (RECS)\nTo supplement CRREM, as well as create average properties where Gross Floor Area (GFA) was unavailable \nwithin datasets, the U.S. Energy Information Agency (EIA)’s Commercial Building Energy Consumption \nSurvey, known as CBECS and Residential Energy Consumption Survey, or RECs, was leveraged to \nsupplement data gaps around properties from Citi’s internal databases and provide a U.S.-centric \nemission factors. This approach was used to provide more granularity to U.S. property pathways than \nCRREM accounts for . The data is derived from 2018 building consumption for CBECS and 2015 building \nconsumption for RECS. In the absence of actual emissions, Citi property data leverage a property and \nlocation crosswalk to triangulate the appropriate EIA CBECS/RECS building average and census region to \napply against GFA. This approach was used to determine the estimated building emissions of a property for \nthe year 2020.\nFocusing on the methodology to supplement data gaps, CBECS and RECS property data points were used \nto develop a Whole Building Methodology by U.S. census region, deriving a property type and/or property \nsub-type to source the average GFA by census region. Where floor area is unavailable, building emissions \nwill be estimated using a Whole Building Approach, resulting in a PCAF data quality Score 5.\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) Emission Factors\nIn conjunction with the EIA CBECS and RECS average property types, where a regional census region \napproach could be applied, EPA emission factors were developed to provide a more accurate estimation \nof the U.S. portfolio. Property- and state-specific emissions factors were developed through a geographic \ncrosswalk, which aligned the eGRID electricity data and EIA combustion data by state to U.S. Census region. \nThese electricity and fuel consumption by property type and census region were then converted using EPA \nemission factors. Scope 1 & 2 emission intensities were then summed by property type and census region \nand then applied to their relevant properties.\nSector Intensity Calculation Methodology       \nSectoral emissions intensity metrics were calculated for our portfolios in all covered sectors:  Auto \nManufacturing, Commercial Real Estate, Energy, Power , Steel and Thermal Coal Mining. \nThe Power and Energy portfolio intensity metrics are inclusive of our commercial and project finance \nloans. For all sectors, portfolio-weighted physical intensity was calculated as the sum of parent company \nemissions intensities,\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LIQUID PIPELINES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A network of pipelines used for transporting liquids, measured in t-km for financed emissions calculations<|>0)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HUANG<|>PERSON<|>Researcher involved in a 2021 study on the carbon footprint of oil product pipelines<|>0)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>L.<|>PERSON<|>Author of the 2021 study on pipeline transportation emissions<|>0)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Q.<|>PERSON<|>Author of the 2021 study on pipeline transportation emissions<|>0)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIANG Y<|>PERSON<|>Author of the 2021 study on pipeline transportation emissions<|>0)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ZHANG H<|>PERSON<|>Author of the 2021 study on pipeline transportation emissions<|>0)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Academic journal publishing the 2021 study on pipeline emissions<|>0)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>U.S. federal agency responsible for environmental regulation and data collection<|>0)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRREM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor, a data provider for property emissions across multiple countries<|>0)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CITI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Financial institution implementing climate change and net zero strategies, including sector emissions calculations<|>0)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EIA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>U.S. Energy Information Administration, responsible for energy consumption surveys and emission factors<|>0)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EPA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. agency providing emission factors for regional and property-specific calculations<|>0)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CBECS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey, providing data on building energy use<|>0)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RECS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Residential Energy Consumption Survey, providing data on residential building energy use<|>0)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FIRUZABAD<|>GEO<|>Location where hostages were held, involved in a swap with Aurelia<|>0)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AURELIA<|>GEO<|>Country seeking to release hostages, involved in negotiations with Firuzabad<|>0)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUINTARA<|>GEO<|>Country that negotiated a swap of funds for hostages with Firuzabad and Aurelia<|>0)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KROHAARA<|>GEO<|>Capital city of Quintara, involved in the hostage transfer<|>0)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TIRUZIA<|>GEO<|>Capital of Firuzabad where hostages were held<|>0)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CASHION<|>GEO<|>Capital of Aurelia, destination for released hostages<|>0)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAMUEL NAMARA<|>PERSON<|>Aurelian businessman held hostage in Tiruzia's Alhamia Prison<|>0)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DURKE BATAGLANI<|>PERSON<|>Aurelian journalist held hostage<|>0)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEGGIE TAZBAH<|>PERSON<|>Bratinas environmentalist and hostage<|>0)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALHAMIA PRISON<|>GEO<|>Prison in Tiruzia where Samuel Namara was held<|>0)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FIRUZABAD<|>AURELIA<|>Firuzians negotiated a hostage exchange with Aurelia<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUINTARA<|>AURELIA<|>Quintara brokered the hostage exchange<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUINTARA<|>FIRUZABAD<|>Quintara facilitated the hostage swap between Firuzabad and Aurelia<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAMUEL NAMARA<|>ALHAMIA PRISON<|>Samuel Namara was held in Alhamia Prison<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAMUEL NAMARA<|>MEGGIE TAZBAH<|>Both were exchanged in the same hostage release<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAMUEL NAMARA<|>DURKE BATAGLANI<|>Both were exchanged in the same hostage release<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MEGGIE TAZBAH<|>DURKE BATAGLANI<|>Both were exchanged in the same hostage release<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAMUEL NAMARA<|>FIRUZABAD<|>Hostage in Firuzabad<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MEGGIE TAZBAH<|>FIRUZABAD<|>Hostage in Firuzabad<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DURKE BATAGLANI<|>FIRUZABAD<|>Hostage in Firuzabad<|>2)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
