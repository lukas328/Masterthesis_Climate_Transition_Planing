In 2022, we achieved a silver SKA \nrating for an additional three branches and one office. By achieving silver, we are demonstrating sustainable \nworkplace design and implementation. As part of our commitment to ensure responsible design of our buildings, we \nare trialling a carbon calculator specifically to understand and review our impact.\nInnovation: in 2022 we trialled remote fixes to our ATMs in our hardest-to-reach branches via augmented reality, \nallowing our engineers to examine an ATM remotely.\nWaste\nSince 2019, we have reduced our waste by 37% by working with our colleagues to educate on the importance of \nthe waste hierarchy and circular economy.\nWe have undertaken analysis of waste at our Gogarburn office to understand how we can achieve zero waste. \nThis highlighted opportunities to reduce single use items by 3 tonnes and increase recycling by an estimated 1.3 \ntonnes. We are working with our waste suppliers towards this zero waste ambition and engaging key stakeholders \nto capitalise on any opportunities there are to reduce, reuse and recycle through our findings and investments.\nOur paper consumption has decreased by 67% from our 2015 baseline through actions such as our digital first \noptions including giving customers the option to switch to paperless, as well as educating colleagues on the \ntechnology they can use instead of printing. Over the course of 2022, we have saved 15.7 million envelopes from \nbeing sent to our customers.\nIn our drive towards a circular economy, we continue to maximise use of pre-loved and up-cycled furniture. Across \nour branches, we re-used a total of 11,767 assets which diverted 461 tonnes of waste. Also, we continue our aim \nto remove single use plastics from our properties, with our key catering supplier removing the majority of plastic \ncups and cutlery from our main offices and our colleagues encouraged to opt for reusable options.\nWe have continued our ambition towards a more sustainable cash cycle with cash now leaving our UK cash \ncentres without plastic wrapping and the notes un-sleeved in line with our charter.\nNew debit cards, made from 86% of recycled materials, have been introduced saving c.190 tCO2e over the past year.\nWe have delivered our most sustainable branch uniform yet in 2022, using recycled fabrics and reducing the use \nof packaging while working to reuse and recycle old uniforms where possible, with internal swap shops and \ndonating non-branded items to charity.\nClimate Group Initiatives\nEP100 – we continue to be on track for our 2025 ambition with energy productivity increasing by 41% since 2015. \nAcross our global portfolio compared with 2021, natural gas consumption decreased by 17% due to the reduced \nreliance on airflow required in our offices as COVID safety measures were removed. Also, electricity consumption \ndecreased by 8% following the implementation of energy efficient plans that includes new ways of working and \nrelocating to more efficient sustainable buildings.\nRE100 – in 2022 we increased our consumption of renewable electricity to 98% across our global operations, \nincluding 100% of UK and Republic of Ireland consuming renewable electricity. We have achieved this through a \ncombination of green tariffs and purchasing Renewable Electricity Certificates (RECs) for our landlord-supplied \nproperties in India, Europe and the UK, where we are currently unable to specify a requirement for renewable \nelectricity. To achieve our 2025 ambition for 100% global renewable electricity, we continue to work with our \nprincipal landlords to advocate for renewable electricity provision for all properties, where possible.\nEV100 – we have installed electric vehicle charging points in 13% of our large office car park spaces across our UK \nportfolio and have converted 3% of our owned and operated fleet to electric vehicles. Since the EV100 ambition \nwas set, the fleet has reduced in size by approximately 66%, and we are reviewing where we can positively impact \nother vehicle electrification outside of our ambition. We are reviewing our learnings from the EV100 plan and would \nlike to adopt these practices across our global operations using electric transport where available and provide \nelectric vehicle chargers for staff at our offices in India. We are also developing the design for an electric vehicle \nmobile branch pilot and supporting charging infrastructure to enable further roll-out.\n76NatWest Group plc | 2022 Climate-related Disclosures Report\nGovernance Strategy and Climate transition plan Risk Management and Scenario Analysis Metrics and TargetsIntroduction\nAbsolute \nemissions = ∑i\nAttr/uni0069but/uni0069on \nfactori\nOutstand/uni0069ng amounti\nTotal equ/uni0069ty + debti\nx\nEm/uni0069ss/uni0069ons\n(w/uni0069th i = borrower \nor /uni0069nvestee)\nEstimation of absolute emissions: In line with the PCAF Standard for financed emissions, we have estimated \nabsolute emissions based on Scope 1 and 2 emissions attributable to loans and investments for the sectors or \nsubsectors analysed. In addition, for our oil and gas extraction, land transport and automotive manufacturing \nsectors, we included Scope 3 emissions based on downstream use of products sold as they constitute a \nlarge proportion of the overall estimated emissions in these sectors. In general, we have sought \nto estimate absolute emissions based on the following formula prescribed by the PCAF Standard:\nIn February 2020, we set ourselves the challenge to at least halve the climate impact of our financing activity \nby 2030 and align with the 2015 Paris Agreement.
