We have initiated work to roll out a company-wide \ninventory and information management platform. This will allow us to better track chemicals \nthrough our manufacturing processes and understand the impacts of changing regulation or \nnew hazard information faster, which would allow us to identify safer and / or more \nsustainable material choices.\nPer- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)\nPer- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a very broad group of 9,000+ chemicals, \nincluding fluoropolymers, that are widely used in industrial and consumer applications due \nto their unique thermal and chemical stability. They are under significant scientific and \nregulatory scrutiny because some PFAS are persistent and mobile in the environment and are \nassociated with certain potential adverse health effects. Chemical manufacturing processes, \nincluding some in JM, often rely on parts, such as process piping and seals that contain these \nfluoropolymers. Some fluoropolymers are also, currently, essential to the proper functioning \nof certain electrolysers and fuel cells technologies. In JM, we are aware of the increasing levels \nof concern over potential risks posed by a subset of PFAS and are committed to reducing our \nuses, developing alternatives, fully understanding and limiting impacts on human health and \nthe environment from PFAS in our operations and products. We are also working directly with \nsuppliers, customers, peers, business associations, NGOs and regulators to ensure responsible \nuse and proportionate regulations of PFAS.\nWorking with genetically engineered microorganisms\nGenetically engineered microorganisms in our biocatalysts (enzymes) represent just 0.01% of \nour sales. None of our products contain live organisms at the point of supply to our customers. \nBiocatalysts are important chemical intermediates in our manufacturing because they can \nhelp us make more of a desired chemical product with fewer undesirable by-products.\nWaste \ntreatment \nSupplier \noperations \nRaw materials and extraction\nJ M \noperations\nCustomer\nWholesale\nConsumer\nEnd of life / \nrecycling \nUpstream\nDownstream\nRecycling / circularity\nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 202332\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION\nSustainability continued\nPeople: Promoting a safe, diverse and equitable society \nOur goal: Keep people safe\nOur ability to catalyse the net zero transition depends on the safe operation of our manufacturing \nsites. The processes and policies we put in place are one part of our approach, but we are also \nimproving our insight and the tools we provide our people so that they can contribute to our safety \nculture every day. We have complex chemical processes that often involve heavy machinery and \nhazardous chemicals. As part of our focus on simplification, we continued embedding the new digital \ntools we introduced in 2021/22. These are streamlining existing processes and enabling a more \ndata-led approach. To reduce our ergonomic injuries we are using a video tool to highlight \nergonomic stress points while carrying out activities and then taking necessary actions to reduce \nthese stress points. Rather than wait for an incident to occur, we are able to proactively spot potential \nissues and take preventative action. A new central industrial hygiene reporting database is due to go \nlive in the first half of 2023/24.\nThe Take 5 programme was launched in 2021/22 to help make sure everyone acts in a responsible \nand safe way at all times. It reminds people to take some time before starting a new activity to make \nsure they are working in a safe and secure environment. This simple action helps reduce incidents \nand drive continued improvements in our processes. This year saw the further embedding of this \nprogramme. During Q4, we tend to see an increase in the number of incidents across all sites. To \nhelp address this we created a toolkit with a range of discussion guides and materials for safety \nbriefings and safety moments focused on ‘Make Time to TAKE 5’, so that everyone can discuss what \nwe can do to mitigate risks. This resulted in over a 50% reduction in recordable incidences compared \nto final quarter 2021/22. We further improved our safety performance through engagement and \nsafety leadership by launching our first global safety day and additional regional EHS conferences \nwith the main topic being safety leadership – further details below.\nOur strategy focuses on  \nthe core strengths that allow \nus to play to win in the \nmarkets we operate in. We \nrely on our 12,600+ talented \nand passionate employees to \ndrive our purpose. Ensuring \nthat they are fulfilled in their \ncareers, work safely and \nreturn home well to their \nfamilies each day is our \nnumber one priority.\n2030 target 2021/22 2022/23 % change against \nprior year\nOur goal: Keep people safe\n<0.25 Total recordable injury and \nillness rate (TRIIR) for employees and \ncontractors\n0.59 0.47 -20%\n0.4 ICCA process safety event severity \nrate (PSESR)\n1.321 1.02 -23%\nOur goal: Create a diverse, inclusive and engaged company\n>8 Employee engagement score Not \nmeasured\n6.9 —\n>40% Female representation across \nall management levels\n27% 28% +1%\nOur goal: Uphold human rights\n% supplier spend assessed for human \nrights risk and remedial plans in \nplace where high risks identified \n- 22% -\nOur goal: Invest in\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
