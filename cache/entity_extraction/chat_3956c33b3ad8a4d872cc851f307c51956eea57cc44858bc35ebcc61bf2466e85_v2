It is a challenge of great \nmagnitude that requires mobilizing the resources that \nchannel the investments that allow the world to function \nwithout emissions. And for that we need mechanisms and \nregulation that encourage this investment.\nAt BBVA, we are aware of this reality for some time now \nand we have been taking steps in this direction. BBVA is \nneutral in its own emissions1 in the main geographies in \nwhich it operates and has assumed the ‘Net Zero 2050’ \ncommitment, that is, the commitment to be neutral in \ncarbon emissions by 2050, not only in its own but also \nincluding emissions financed of our customers.\nThis means that many of our customers are going to develop \nand implement transition plans, which require a lot of \ninvestment, and our role is to support them with advice and \nfinancing, facilitating a transition that is as fair and inclusive as \npossible, creating opportunities and leaving no one behind.\nWith this framework and objective, we have set intermediate \nemission targets in 2030 for our financing portfolios in \n6 highly emitting sectors (oil & gas, power generation, autos, \nsteel, cement, and coal).\nThis is the first TCFD report in which we have incorporated \nseveral of the GFANZ recommendations for the preparation \nof a T ransition Plan, a core element to facilitate a greater \nunderstanding of how we approach the transition from BBVA \nfor our investors, shareholders, supervisors, regulators, \ncustomers, civil society organizations and other stakeholders.\n1.
