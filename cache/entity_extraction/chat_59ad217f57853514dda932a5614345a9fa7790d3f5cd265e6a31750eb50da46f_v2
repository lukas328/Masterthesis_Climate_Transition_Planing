During the \nyear, we have not identified any new climate-related risks but we have combined two risks \nwhich were previously reported separately as we recognised they were strongly \ninterconnected with both being influenced by pricing and carbon markets.\nAssessing those risks\nOur enterprise risk framework provides the tools and guidance to our businesses on how \nto assess all risk types. The framework allows the comparison of risks using the metrics \nof likelihood, time horizon and financial impact to determine most material risks to our \nbusiness.\nDuring the year climate risks have been approached with renewed focus through evaluating \npotential impact and velocity – immediacy of impact. Use of this extra metric has allowed the \ndetermination of which climate risks pose most immediate material impact to our operations. \nThis evolution from a reactive to a proactive strategic approach is essential for maturing our \nassessment and integration of climate risk mitigation into our business strategy.\nWe also use external third parties to evaluate physical climate risks at our locations and those \nof our suppliers.
