It is structured \naround three strategic pillars of Invest, \nEngage and Lead. \n \nOur strategic pillars are anchored by the strength of our governance \nand risk management frameworks, scenario analysis and the \nongoing investment in our people capabilities, climate data  \nand technology platforms. \nWe recognise that delivering our net zero ambitions is a journey  \nand whilst we have made good progress to date, we know we have a \nlong way to go. Much of our work to date has focused on laying the \ngroundwork to deliver our net zero transition – in particular emissions \nbaselining, strategy development and mandatory disclosures.\nThis work is described in detail in our 2022 Climate Report, which \nwas prepared in accordance with the recommendations and \nrecommended disclosures of the Financial Stability Board’s Task \nForce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (‘TCFD’). A summary \nof our progress against the TCFD’s four pillars of governance, \nstrategy, risk management and targets and metrics is included  \nin Appendix page 77. \n  \nOur initial steps to decarbonise our investment portfolio, operations \nand supply chain, and our plans to build on them are described in  \nthe Invest, Engage and Lead sections on pages 42–65.\n18\nPhoenix Group Holdings plc Net Zero Transition Plan\nInvest Engage Lead\nEmbedding net zero \nin our business\nBecoming a \nnet zero business Measuring our progress\nExecutive \nsummary\nClimate change nexus with  \nhuman rights, the just transition \nand nature\nWe recognise that climate action cannot be addressed in a silo, \nand that it is linked with other challenges captured in our \nGroup sustainability strategy. \nHuman rights and the just transition \nThe Paris Agreement recognised the importance of a ‘just \ntransition’ – a transition to a low-carbon economy which \naddresses social and economic risks and opportunities for \npeople, communities and industries facing dislocation and \ndisruption. The UK government’s Green Job Taskforce \nhighlighted that there are more than 400,000 jobs in low carbon \nbusinesses and their supply chains, generating more than \n£42 billion of revenue1. Just as the net zero transition offers job \ncreation, better quality or higher income jobs and co-benefits of \nbetter air quality and related health benefits, so some industries \nand job sectors will face job or income loss. These socio-\neconomic effects have regional dynamics. Areas that are \ndependent on high-emitting industries are likely to face \nchallenges related to worker displacement or job losses,  \nwhile regions with favourable conditions for renewable  \nenergy production will face the impacts of large infrastructure \nprojects and rapid economic growth 2.\nGreater flexibility under the proposed reforms to Solvency II \npresent a significant opportunity for insurers such as Phoenix \nto direct more private sector capital into the real economy, \nwhich can support a just transition. Phoenix plans to increase \ninvestments in illiquid assets and sustainable investments over the \nnext five years (subject to regulatory and market conditions), to \nsupport house building, green energy, and local communities \nacross the country, without compromising policyholder  \nprotection. As an example, we are collaborating with the \nChamber of Commerce in Edinburgh to support a just transition \nto a low-carbon economy, as part of an eight-year programme \nthrough to 2030.\nClimate-n\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PHOENIX GROUP HOLDINGS PLC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A major insurance and investment
