This extensive, three-year farm-based \nprogramme intends to highlight opportunities \nfor reducing the carbon emissions of barley \nproduction. The ambition is for the barley grown  \nto be used to brew beautiful tasting Guinness.\n11\nWe are collaborating with a sample of growers \nin Scotland and Ireland to gather on-farm \ndata, which together with satellite imagery and \nAI- informed predictive analytics, will improve \nbaseline carbon footprint data and provide \ninsights into other on-farm environmental metrics. \nThis analysis will in turn allow us to identify \nopportunities for greatest improvement on-farm \nso we can focus our efforts on where we can make \nthe biggest positive impact.\nSupply Chain \nCASE STUDY\nSupply Chain \nCASE STUDY\n   Operations\nWe have the greatest influence & control \nover our direct operations, which is why we \nhave made bold commitments to reduce our \noperational emissions 100% by 2030. \nUnderpinning our goals are detailed roadmaps \nin each of our key focus areas:\nDIAGEO EMISSIONS REDUCTION HIERARCHY\nDIRECT OPERATIONS (SCOPE 1&2)\n12\nConverting Energy Sources to Renewable\nWe are committed to using only renewable energy by 2030, having achieved over 40% \nalready. We are developing detailed site-by-site decarbonisation roadmaps and guidance \nto phase our transition to net zero. We are already members of RE100 committing to 100% \nrenewable electricity by 2030, surpassing our 2020 target to reach over 80% to date. \nTo do this we aim to:\n• Convert electricity and fuel energy sources across all of our sites to renewable alternatives\n• Prioritise direct emissions reduction opportunities over energy attribute certificates wherever possible\n• Create additional renewable energy capacity to power our sites, exporting surplus energy to the local \ngrid, through on-site developments and using Power Purchase Agreements (PPA)\n• Use the right fit technology with the lowest environmental impact across its lifecycle in each location, \ninnovating and trialing new technologies through the Diageo Sustainable Solutions programme\n• Identify opportunities to partner and collaborate with suppliers and local communities on renewable energy \nschemes, to create as many communal benefits as we can.\n• Transition our site-based vehicles to renewable and low emission alternatives\nReducing Residual Emissions\nResidual emissions are those that are not feasible to eliminate yet, such as fugitive \nemissions from refrigerants, non-zero bioenergy emission factors, shared on-site transport, \nand emergency operations that rely on back up fuels. We closely monitor our residual \nemissions, and actively seek out new technologies as they develop to minimize emissions as \nmuch as possible. To reach net zero we will use carbon offsets for residual emissions, which we \nanticipate to be no more than 5-10% of our direct operation baseline emissions.\nREDUCE ENERGY  \nCONSUMPTION\nRECOVER &  \nRE-USE ENERGY\nREDUCE ENERGY  \nEMISSIONS\nUSE ENERGY  \nATTRIBUTE  \nCERTIFICATES\nCOMPENSATE \nRESIDUAL  \nEMISSIONS\nMeasures & Opportunities\nEnergy Efficiency\nThe energy we use is critical to our business operations.
