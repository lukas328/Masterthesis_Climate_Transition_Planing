Ninety One votes at \nshareholder meetings throughout the world as a matter of policy and \nprinciple. We aim to cast a vote on all items put to a shareholder vote \nwhere legally and practically possible.\nWe use an external proxy-research and vote-execution service provided \nby Institutional Shareholder Services (“ISS”). ISS delivers its benchmark \nresearch and Ninety One’s custom policy research based on our internal \nvoting policy. While proxy advisors provide input, we retain ultimate \ndiscretion on how we vote.

They are key shareholder rights globally, though submission \nrequirements vary based on countries’ legal frameworks. \nThere has been an increase in the number of shareholder resolutions \nappearing on meeting agendas in recent years that focus on very \nspecific issues. As the requirements of these resolutions vary \nsignificantly, Ninety One reviews votes on a case-by-case basis, after \nconsidering the materiality of the issue, whether the requirements are \nclear and reasonable, and whether the company is actively making \nprogress or has made a commitment to address the issue. In addition, \nwe have been reviewing share actions to identify common themes \nthat are emerging, and developing our internal guidance to establish \na clear and consistent approach to them.\nOver the reporting period, we voted on 365 shareholder proposals. \nWe supported a significant number of them (49%) because they \nsought to improve ESG practices, were targeted and focused, and \nwere neither too prescriptive nor too vague in their requests.\nAs an active investor, Ninety One prioritises direct dialogue with \ncompany boards and management teams to achieve our desired \noutcomes. Shareholder proposals are one of the mechanisms \navailable to influence companies. We assess each shareholder \nproposal individually, taking into account the outcomes of our \nown engagement, the relevance of the proposal to our strategic \nobjectives, and progress being made by companies on these issues. \nThe proportion of votes we support in any given year reflects the \ntopic, relevance and quality of the proposals.\nSustainability and Stewardship Report\n47\nCase study:\nSasol: voting against the climate \nchange report\nSasol is one of the highest-emitting companies in our corporate \nportfolio and we have been engaging with the company to better \nunderstand and monitor progress on its transition plan. We are also \nthe co-lead on the Climate Action 100+ collaborative engagement.\nFollowing regular meetings with the company over many years, \nwe met with Sasol at the end of 2023 to discuss progress on its \nclimate strategy to inform our voting ahead of the shareholder \nannual general meeting (“AGM”). Overall, we are comfortable with \nthe ambition of its 2030 emissions reduction targets and note some \npositive progress in the implementation of the strategy with respect \nto renewables procurement and boiler turndown solutions. However, \nwe are concerned about Sasol’s ability to replace coal feedstock \nin its production process with cleaner alternatives by 2030. Our \nprimary concern is that the affordability of its climate strategy could \nresult in a decision to delay coal reduction and therefore that the \nprobability of reaching its targets declined over the reporting year.\nFollowing the meeting, we decided to vote against the Climate \nChange Report at the AGM. It should be noted that this is not a \nwholesale rejection of Sasol’s climate strategy, and we remain \nconfident in management’s commitment to developing and \nimplementing a plausible transition strategy. We also followed up \nthis vote with a letter to the chair clarifying our position. We will \ncontinue to engage with the board to support this.\nProxy voting\nFixed Income\nEquities\nSustainability and Stewardship Report\n48\nCase study:\nExxonMobil: voting against management \nrecommendation on four resolutions\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NINETY ONE<|><|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ninety One is an investment management firm that actively engages in proxy voting, shareholder meetings, and ESG practices, aiming to create long-term shareholder value across multiple countries and regions.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>INSTITUTIONAL SHAREHOLDER SERVICES<|><|>ORGANIZATION<|>ISS is an external proxy research and vote-execution service provider that supplies benchmark research and custom policy research to Ninety One, supporting its proxy voting activities.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>SASOL<|><|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sasol is a high-emitting company in Ninety One's portfolio, engaged in energy and chemical production, with a focus on transitioning to cleaner energy sources and reducing emissions, and is subject to active engagement and voting on climate-related issues.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>EXXONMOBIL<|><|>ORGANIZATION<|>ExxonMobil is a major oil and gas corporation that has been the subject of shareholder votes and management resolutions, with Ninety One voting against some management recommendations related to environmental and strategic issues.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNITED KINGDOM<|><|>GEO<|>The United Kingdom is one of the top countries where Ninety One votes at shareholder meetings, indicating its global operational and engagement scope.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINA<|><|>GEO<|>China is a key country where Ninety One participates in shareholder meetings, reflecting its international investment and engagement activities.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOUTH AFRICA<|><|>GEO<|>South Africa is among the top countries where Ninety One votes at shareholder meetings, highlighting its regional focus and investment presence.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>US<|><|>GEO<|>The United States is a significant country for Ninety One's voting activities, representing its involvement in major global markets.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>INDIA<|><|>GEO<|>India is a country where Ninety One votes at shareholder meetings, indicating its investment activities in emerging markets.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>JAPAN<|><|>GEO<|>Japan is a country where Ninety One participates in shareholder meetings, reflecting its global reach.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAYMAN ISLANDS<|><|>GEO<|>Cayman Islands is a jurisdiction involved in Ninety One's operations, possibly related to fund structures or investment vehicles.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>NETHERLANDS<|><|>GEO<|>The Netherlands is a country where Ninety One votes at shareholder meetings, indicating its European investment activities.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUSTRALIA<|><|>GEO<|>Australia is among the countries where Ninety One participates in shareholder meetings, reflecting its global investment scope.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>BRAZIL<|><|>GEO<|>Brazil is a country where Ninety One votes at shareholder meetings, indicating its presence in Latin American markets.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLIMATE ACTION 100+<|><|>ORGANIZATION<|>Climate Action 100+ is a collaborative engagement initiative that involves companies like Sasol, focusing on climate strategy and emissions reduction targets.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>SASOL<|><|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sasol is a high-emission energy and chemical company engaged in climate strategy discussions and shareholder engagement regarding its transition plan.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>EXXONMOBIL<|><|>ORGANIZATION<|>ExxonMobil is a major oil and gas company that has been subject to shareholder votes and management resolutions, with some votes against management recommendations on environmental issues.)##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
