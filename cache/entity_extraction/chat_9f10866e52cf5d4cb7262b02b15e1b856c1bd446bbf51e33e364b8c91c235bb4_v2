Using the sunâ€™s \nenergy, the microalgae convert the \nwaste discharge into oxygen and \nrenewable biomass. This biomass can \nthen be used for fuel and fertilisers, \nandÂ the richly oxygenated water is a \nboost forÂ local aquatic life.\nThe project has been a huge success. \nWeÂ no longer need to outsource \nourÂ wastewater treatment â€“ saving us \nhundreds of thousands of pounds so far. \nThe process offers uninterrupted \nperformance, with no freshwater \nconsumption, and the end results help \nsupport the local environment. Thatâ€™s \nwhy the project was awarded an internal \nJohnson Matthey award in 2022.\nPlanet: Protecting nature and advancing the circular economy continued \n1.

They \nalsoÂ get us a seat at the table with policy makers, regulators and industry bodies. This global \nengagement is allowing us to share our expertise around catalysis, product stewardship, \nPGMÂ supply and sustainable technologies and contribute to the important discussion about \nwhat net zero looks like in practice. It also helps us maintain high standards and adapt \ntoÂ continually evolving regulation in our markets. In the UK we are working with the \ngovernment, directly and through the Chemicals Industry Association (CIA), on potential \nrevisions to the UKâ€™s Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals \n(UKÂ REACH) regulation. We also work with a range of EU industry consortia such as \nEuropeanÂ Chemical Industry Council (Cefic), Eurometaux and European Precious Metals \nFederation (EPMF). \nProduct life cycle analysis\nProduct life cycle analysis (LCA) is an \nimportant way in which we can \ndemonstrate how the environmental \nbenefits of our products outweigh the \nimpact of making them in the first place.\nWe are committed to making cradle-to-\ngate LCAs of our products available to \nour customers on request. \nWe also contribute to the International \nPlatinum Group Metals Association \n(IPA)'s publicly available industry \nstandard LCA for the five platinum group \nmetals â€“ Pt, Pd, Rh, Ir and Ru â€“ which is \nupdated annually to ISO 14001 \nstandards.\n  Visit the IPA website for more \ninformation: ipa-news.de\nPlanet: Protecting nature and advancing the circular economy continued \nFinding safer alternatives and reducing risk \nOur product stewardship reporting programme helps us track product performance every \nyear. This year, we found no reports of significant health effects from the use of our products, \nand we continue to comply with all health and safety, labelling and marketing regulations, \nand voluntary codes. We engage with customers to promote understanding of the hazards of \nour products, and our New Product Introduction (NPI) framework requires teams to consider \nways to reduce hazardous raw material use. \nAlongside the broader transformation of Johnson Matthey, we are also upgrading our \nprocesses around product stewardship. We have initiated work to roll out a company-wide \ninventory and information management platform. This will allow us to better track chemicals \nthrough our manufacturing processes and understand the impacts of changing regulation or \nnew hazard information faster, which would allow us to identify safer and / or more \nsustainable\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
