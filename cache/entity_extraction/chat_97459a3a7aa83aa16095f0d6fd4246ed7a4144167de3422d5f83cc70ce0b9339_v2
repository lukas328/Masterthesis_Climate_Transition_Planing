Signatories engage \nwith issuers to maintain \nor enhance the value \nof assets.\nPlease refer to the ‘Active ownership’ section of the report. The engagement approach \nmay differ depending on the strategy in question due to asset class or length of holding \nperiod. However, our stewardship approach to debt and equity is increasingly aligning.\nOur firmwide strategic engagements have largely focused on and prioritised our top-\nemitting companies in order to make progress towards our net-zero targets. Additional \nstrategic engagements are typically prioritised by individual investment teams based on \nfactors such as issues they have deemed material for their strategy, size of holding and \nability to influence. \nObjectives and engagement plans are set for all strategic engagements. Please refer to \nthe case studies on page 36.\nPlease refer to Appendix 4 for examples of the methods of engagement used.\n10. Signatories, where \nnecessary, participate in \ncollaborative engagement \nto influence issuers.\nRefer to page 42 for examples and outcomes of collaborative engagements we have \nparticipated in and page 52 for further examples of our collaboration with industry \norganisations.\n91\nSustainability and Stewardship Report\nPrinciple Ninety One’s activities \n11. Signatories, where \nnecessary, escalate \nstewardship activities to \ninfluence issuers.\nPlease refer to page 33, which outlines our approach to escalation, including an example. \nPlease also see the proxy voting case studies on page 47, which give examples of how we \nuse our voting rights as part of our escalation strategies. Our approach is tailored to the \nspecific circumstances of the company in question, for example allowing for the fact that it \nis more challenging, and will take more time, for emerging market companies (such as Sasol) \nto transition towards net zero. We would highlight the Eskom engagement case study on \npage 37, which highlights how our engagement approach reflects the local social, political \nand economic backdrop in South Africa, and Eskom’s crucial role as an enabler of economic \ndevelopment. \nIf our initial approach to engagement is not successful, we are not able to build commitment \nor there is no appropriate response from a company, we carefully consider our options to \nescalate the engagement using various approaches. These include:\n ɽ Meetings with the chairman and selected directors and executives to understand  \ntheir view\n ɽ AGM attendance and questions\n ɽ Shareholder resolution\n ɽ Collaboration with shareholders who share the same concern\n ɽ Engaging through local engagement groups; e.g. the UK Investor Forum\n ɽ Voting against management\n ɽ An extraordinary general meeting\n ɽ Selling the shares\n12. Signatories actively \nexercise their rights and \nresponsibilities.\nPlease refer to pages 44-48, which detail our proxy-voting approach and data over the \nreporting period. \nWhile our proxy-voting guidelines apply globally, we recognise regional differences. In \nmarkets where the codes are still evolving and not yet fully aligned with global best practice, \nwe take this into account. In these markets, we aim to engage actively with policymakers, \nregulators and stock exchanges, together with other investors, to address any critical \npotential shortcomings. \nSome clients may have policies that differ from ours. Although we welcome views on voting \nitems, we do not currently take direction or override our policy for pooled fund clients. For \nclients invested in segregated portfolios, we put mechanisms in place to adhere to their \nvoting guidelines, if required. \nWe do not take part in stock lending, so this does not affect our voting process.\nRights and responsibilities regarding credit instruments\nWe exercise our rights and responsibilities for credit instruments in the following ways:\n ɽ We are often a member of bond or loan syndicates, where amendments to the \ndocumentation or indentures are typically facilitated through the facility agent or \narranging bank. We review any borrower requests or amendments and then submit our \nvote or signed amendment through the appropriate channel.\n ɽ To the extent there is a potential impairment of a holding, a coordinating committee is \nusually formed to represent the interests of the bond or loan holders. This committee \nis typically made up of the largest lenders, and where we fall into that category we \nare happy to represent our interests accordingly. This committee negotiates with the \nborrower or any restructuring officer to ensure a fair outcome for lenders.\n ɽ Analysts review bond or loan prospectuses ahead of investment. We also use a third-\nparty legal service called Xtract, which comprehensively reviews all bond and loan \ndocumentation, flagging potentially relevant terms in the documentation.\n ɽ Refinancing or new issuances provide a meaningful opportunity to engage on \nsustainability-related issues with a company.\n92\nSustainability and Stewardship Report\nPrinciple Ninety One’s activities \n1. Integration of \nenvironmental, social and \ngovernance factors\nOur Sustainability Policy and Stewardship Policy and Proxy Voting Guidelines outline our \nfirmwide approach to sustainability and the integration of ESG factors. \nPlease refer to the Invest section of this report which discusses how our various \ninvestment teams integrate\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
