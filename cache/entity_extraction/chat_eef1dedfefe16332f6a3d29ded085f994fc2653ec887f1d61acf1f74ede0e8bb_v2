Inclusive growth, a core element of \nthe sustainability strategy\nWithin the framework of the General \nSustainability Policy, BBVA focuses its \nstrategy in this area around two vectors: \n   The fight against climate change and the \nprotection of natural capital\n Inclusive growth\nIn this second subject it is very relevant to \ncontribute to a just transition, leaving no one \nbehind and bringing the age of opportunity \nto everyone.\nAt the implementation level, the just \ntransition perspective has been integrated \ninto different lines of work throughout the \norganization that are developed in the \nbusiness areas through our Community \nInvestment initiatives and our relationship \nwith employees and suppliers.\nWith regard to the €135.871bn mobilized \nin sustainable business between 2018 and \n2022, 22% are intended to contribute to the \ninclusive growth of the customers and the \nsocieties where the Group operates. In this \nline of inclusive growth, resources have been \nmobilized for investments necessary for a \njust transition (e.g., social infrastructure), \nfinancing has been allocated to strengthen \nand transform the business sector to \npromote inclusive and sustainable economic \ngrowth, and credit products (cards, loans \nand mortgages) have been designed and \nmarketed to individuals who meet the \nlow-income and/or vulnerability thresholds \nestablished for each country.\nIn addition, a pilot project was launched in \nMexico and Colombia in 2022 to promote \nthe financial inclusion of unbanked groups \nand to improve the financial health and \nresilience of underbanked or underserved \ncustomers.\nBBVA also supports inclusive \nentrepreneurship, with special relevance \nin T urkey, where there is a line of financing \nfor women entrepreneurs (in small and \nmedium-sized companies) with loans under \npreferential conditions.\nAlso noteworthy in this area is BBVA’s \npromotion of microfinance through the \nBBVA Microfinance Foundation, whose main \npurpose is to provide financial services, to \ntrain and to support the people in vulnerable \nsituations so that they can progress through \nthe surpluses generated by their productive \nactivities. Further, the BBVA Microfinance \nFoundation has products and services for \nthe adaptation of small farmers to climate \nchange, such as Eco Vivienda, Ecocrédito \nor the agreement with the NGO water.\norg to facilitate access to clean water and \nsanitation systems. \nP.  39\nBBVA Report on TCFD 2022\nThis English version is a translation of the original in Spanish for information purposes only. In case of a discrepancy, the Spanish original will prevail.\nSECTION 02 / STRATEGY\n2.  Gradual integration in risk \nmanagement\nBBVA has been conducting human rights \ndue diligence processes in line with the UN \nGuiding Principles on Business and Human \nRights, incorporating the vision of a just \ntransition in critical sectors in the green \ntransition (specifically mining, agribusiness, \nenergy and infrastructure). Specifically, \nBBVA’s Environmental and Social Framework \n(hereinafter, the Framework) establishes due \ndiligence for new customers and operations \ncovered by the Framework, in order to \nmitigate the environmental and social risks \nassociated with these sectors.\n \n \nLikewise, as a signatory of the Equator \nPrinciples, BBVA has due diligence \nprocedures relating to the financing of new \nprojects whose implementation affects \nindigenous communities. When this \ncircumstance occurs, the free, prior and \ninformed consent is required from these \ncommunities, irrespective of the geographic \nlocation of the project, including for projects \nin countries where a robust legislative \nsystem is presupposed, which ensures the \nprotection of the environment and the social \nrights of its inhabitants. When identifying \npotential risks, the operation must include \nan effective form of management of these \nrisks, as well as operational mechanisms to \nsupport claims management.\n3. Engagement with initiatives to \npromote a just transition\nFinally, BBVA participates in international \nindustry-specific initiatives in support of a \njust transition, such as the UNEP-FI “Social \nand Human Rights Thematic Advisory Group \n(TAG)” . Further, BBVA is part of the CSR \nEurope’s multi-sectoral working group (The \nEuropean Business Network for Corporate \nSustainability and Responsibility) for an \nInclusive Green Deal.\nLikewise, BBVA also understands the \njust transition in the framework of the \nrelationship between developed and \ndeveloping countries. A just transition \ncannot be undertaken without the \nincorporation of those economies that are \nalready suffering the most from the impact \nof climate change and have the greatest \nfinancial and institutional challenges to \naddress the transition. BBVA is therefore \nvocal in promoting greater financial support \nto developing countries and participates in \ninitiatives such as CFLI (Climate Finance \nLeadership Initiative) in Colombia or the \nEuropean Commission’s HLEG (High-Level \nExpert Group in sustainable finance) to \npromote sustainable finance in low and \nmiddle-income countries.\nP.  40\nBBVA Report on T\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
