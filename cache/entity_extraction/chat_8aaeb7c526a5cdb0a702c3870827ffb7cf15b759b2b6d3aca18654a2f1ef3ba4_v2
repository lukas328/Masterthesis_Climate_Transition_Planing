While water, flood and storm \nprotection and climate regulation are the \nmost important ecosystem services on \nwhich our loan portfolio depends, confirming \nour current environmental priorities.\nGiven the importance to BBVA’s loan \nportfolio and the dependence on water \nresources in the Power Generation \nsector, the Group has built a framework \nfor conducting detailed water stress risk \nassessments at the customer level. This \nassessment was carried out using the \nlocations of its customer’s power generation \nplants, the Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas tool of \nthe World Resources Institute (WRI), which \nidentifies water risk at asset locations, and \nthe ENCORE (Exploring Natural Capital \nOpportunities, Risks and Exposure) tool \ndeveloped by the Natural Capital Finance \nAlliance, which details water impacts and \ndependencies.\nThe results of the assessment are a water \nstress risk scorecard of the customer and \nof the assets.
