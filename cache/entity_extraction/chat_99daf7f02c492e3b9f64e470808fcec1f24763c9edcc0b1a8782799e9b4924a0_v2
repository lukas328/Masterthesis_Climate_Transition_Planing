This phased approach is shown in our road map below.\n • We purchased and retired 120,000 carbon removal credits, assured under the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS), \nand Triple Gold certified to the Climate, Community & Biodiversity Alliance Standards (CCBA) to invest beyond \nour value chain, and provide benefits to climate, especially those that generate additional co-benefits for people \nand nature.\n • In accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, our emission reduction targets are not achieved through the \nuse of carbon credits. Carbon credits will only be used to neutralise the remaining 10% of our 2050 target once \nreductions have been achieved.\n • Reductions are calculated using the location-based methodology, as such they do not include the use of \nrenewable electricity certificates to reduce emissions.\n • We achieved 46% carbon reduction in our direct own operations (location-based) and are reporting our \nupstream and downstream operational value chain for the first time this year.\n • Projects completed during the reporting year will provide annual energy savings of 15.4 GWh(*) and cost savings \nof £2.4 million(*).\n • Approval and accountability of our own operational emissions lies with our executives, including Director \nof Productivity, and up to C-Suite Board members.\n • Our operational emission reductions are linked to remuneration. For further information, please see the \nremuneration section of our 2022 Annual Report and Accounts.\nFor further detail on 2022 progress against our key own operational metrics and targets, as well as detail on \nspecific initiatives, please see section 5.4. \n(1) Our operational value chain captures greenhouse gas emissions Scopes 1, 2 and 3 (Categories 1-14, excluding Categories 8, 10, 14). Category 15 is discussed in section 5.5.\n(2) Our direct own operations are greenhouse gas emissions from Scopes 1, 2 and 3 (paper, water, waste, business travel, commuting and working from home).\n(3) The SBTi recommends that companies invest to mitigate emissions beyond their value chain while they transition towards a state of net zero emissions. In accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, our emission reductions are not achieved through the use of carbon credits. \n(*) Within scope of EY assurance.

Making our branches more \nsustainable is a vital part of this.\nSince 2020, we have been on a journey to improve \nand embed sustainable practices across all our \nbranch locations.\nThis has included improving the EPC ratings of our \nbuildings for better energy efficiency, the reuse of \nfurniture to minimise waste, and the use of natural \nbiodegradable or recycled and recyclable materials. \nIn addition, LED lighting is being deployed \nthroughout our branches as standard to further \nreduce energy consumption.\nIn 2021, we delivered our first sustainable hub \nin Bristol: a dynamic space providing a safe \nand relaxing environment, focused on accessibility and \nsupporting vulnerable customers, and which achieved \nthe Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors’ SKA Silver \naccreditation(1). \nImportantly, this also provided valuable insights \ninto the practices we can deploy elsewhere \nin other branches.\nSince then, we have completed a further four \ns\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
