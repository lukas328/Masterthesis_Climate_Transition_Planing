During 2022 we enhanced our due diligence and investment processes to reflect our \nambition to achieve net zero emissions across our in-scope Assets under Management by \n2050. The following processes support the identification, assessment, and management of \nclimate-related risks in our asset management investment products:\nManaging climate risk within \nour Assets under Management\nESG due diligence process for funds: Our fund due diligence process incorporates our \nresponsible investing framework and employs multiple indicators to assess underlying funds on \nthree levels: Firm approach, Investment Strategy and Stewardship.\nAll third-party funds are required to complete our responsible investing questionnaire. This data \ninforms our ESG assessment and results in a responsible investing score, which feeds into our \noverall fund assessment. It also forms the basis of our engagement with fund managers.\nAssessing net zero alignment: to manage our exposure to climate-related risk in our \ninvestment products we assess the extent to which third-party funds have a commitment and \ninvestment strategy that is aligned to net zero.\n • We have designed our Net Zero Investment Framework, which uses qualitative and \nquantitative data sourced from fund managers, to assess the credibility of their net zero \nstrategy and commitments.\n • All in-scope AuM are assigned a net zero score, and those which have a net zero strategy  \ndeemed credible are counted towards our Portfolio Alignment metric, which measures the \npercentage of underlying holdings that we deem to be on a net-zero trajectory.\nMonitoring of climate-related metrics: In addition to the responsible investing score and the \nnet zero score we also incorporate carbon intensity into our fund-level pre-trade analysis - refer \nto section 1.3 for further detail. The overall climate risk exposure of our in-scope AuM is \nmonitored periodically throughout our investment process.\nManaging climate-related risks across Asset Management: In addition to the enhancements \nmade to the investment process we have also integrated climate risk into our Asset Management \nbusiness risk processes. For example, in 2022 we set out ESG-related controls to enhance our \noversight and confidence in our climate-related data. Asset Management also feeds into the \nNatWest Group-wide scenario analysis exercises to enhance our overall approach to climate-\nrelated risk.\n65NatWest Group plc | 2022 Climate-related Disclosures Report\nGovernance Strategy and Climate transition plan Risk Management and Scenario Analysis Metrics and TargetsIntroduction\nMetrics and \ntargets\nThe metrics and targets used to assess,  \nmonitor and manage relevant climate-related  \nrisks and opportunities.\nIn this section\n5.1 Heightened climate-related risk exposure\n5.2 UK residential mortgages – energy efficiency  \nand flood risk assessment\n5.3 Climate and sustainable funding and financing\n5.4 NatWest Group’s own operational footprint\n5.5 Estimates of financed emissions\n5.6 Estimates of facilitated emissions from corporate bond underwriting\n5.7 Cautions about climate-related metrics,  \ndata and methodology challenges\n5.8 Climate-related data and other forward-looking  \nstatements and metrics\n5\nKey sources of estimation uncertainty and volatility: NatWest Group’s 2022 \nClimate-related Disclosures Report requires the application of a number of\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
