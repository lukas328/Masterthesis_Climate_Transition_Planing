It also illustrates to stakeholders \nthat a financial institution is taking the transition \nrisks it faces seriously, working to mitigate them  \nas the transition to a net-zero economy progresses. \nThe breadth of a net-zero transition plan requires \nrevisiting strategies, governance, incentives, and \nother fundamental business considerations. The \nfour key financing strategies provide a lens through \nwhich an institution can review its entire business. \nThe review should assess how the allocation of \ncapital and provision of related services can enable \nreal-economy GHG emissions reduction and thus \nform the basis of a transition strategy that can \nbe embedded throughout the organization. The \ndetails of a transition plan should articulate how the \nstrategy will be executed and how the institution \nwill measure and govern its effectiveness. Details \ndiffer depending on an institution’s business model, \noperating environment (economic and geographic), \nsphere of influence, and portfolio composition.\nExecuting on a transition plan requires action across \nvarious areas within a financial institution, but also \nfrom a financial institution’s clients or portfolio \ncompanies. Financial institutions should work with \nall relevant clients and portfolio companies to \nunderstand their targets and plans, to support \nnot only expanding climate solutions, but also \ndelivering near-term, real-world GHG emissions \nreduction in line with the need for substantial \nreductions by 2030. This includes identifying \ntheir most significant sources of emissions and \ndeveloping strategies to finance their  reduction.\nCONTENTS  |  FINANCIAL INSTITUTION NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLANS — FUNDAMENTALS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND GUIDANCE\n15\nIn developing this guidance, we have taken a \ncomprehensive approach to identifying the core \ncommon elements that a credible transition plan \nshould contain if it is to be practically useful to \na financial institution and enable the financial \ninstitution to fulfill its commitment. While the focus \nis on providing guidance for financial institutions’ \nimplementation of transition strategies, the \nrecommendations and guidance also highlight \nthe clear, consistent, and decision-useful types of \ninformation needed by other stakeholders including \nregulators and governments. The recommendations \nand guidance have global applicability to \nencourage consistency in financing strategies \nacross the sector, although implementation will \ndepend on each institution 's specific role and \nbusiness model.\nTransition planning is not a one-time exercise. \nAs the global net-zero transition progresses and \nfinancial institutions assess their strategies with \nimproved and new climate-related scenarios and \nsectoral pathways, it is important that transition \nplans are regularly reviewed and updated, \nespecially in light of the rapid pace of change. \nAt the same time, our understanding of what \nconstitutes best practice will evolve, and we will \ncontinue efforts to refine the recommendations and \nguidance in years to come in collaboration with our \nnet-zero partners across the financial sector. \nAn economy-wide net-zero transition requires \neffort from multiple stakeholders. GFANZ is \ncommitted to engaging with wider stakeholders \nincluding financial regulators, supervisors, industry \ninitiatives, real-economy representatives, and civil \nsociety organizations to ensure that application of \nthese recommendations and guidance will produce \nthe information they need to evaluate transition \nplanning efforts and the associated climate risk \nmitigation, and better inform them of progress. \nThis includes:\n• providing microprudential and macroprudential \nsupervisors and regulators with insight into how \nfinancial institutions’ transitions, individually \nand collectively, may impact firm-specific and \nsector-wide financial stability risks, including \ntransparency on the efforts individual firms are \ntaking to mitigate their transition risks;\n• providing governments and policymakers \nwith insight into how the financial system, \nthrough its capital allocation, is able to support \nthe transition to net zero, and to identify \nchallenges requiring policy intervention, such \nthat governments can deliver on their own \ncommitments to net zero;\n• providing securities regulators and other \nstakeholders with insight into the actions being \ntaken by financial institutions and companies to \ndeliver on their stated commitments; \n• providing real-economy companies with a \nview to the transition-related information that \nfinancial institutions need for their own net-zero \ntransition plan and therefore expect from real-\neconomy companies; and\n• providing civil society with the consistent \ninformation to form a global, pan-sector view \nof net-zero transition planning for financial \ninstitutions that will allow monitoring and \nmeasurement of progress across the sector.\nCONTENTS  |  FINANCIAL INSTITUTION NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLANS — FUNDAMENTALS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND GUIDANCE\n16\nRelated topics\n62 This report focuses on implementation of net-zero transition plans, rather than disclosure.
