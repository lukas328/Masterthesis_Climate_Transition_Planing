Consolidated non-current assets exclude financial investments, restricted assets, assets arising from insurance business, deferred taxation assets and \npost-employment benefit net assets. \nRevenues in brief Note 2.1: \nThe Group generates revenues from its underwriting activities (insurance \nRevenues premiums), trading activities through the provision of healthcare and \ninsurance management services (care, health and other customer contract \nrevenue) and rental income and other fees (other revenue). \nRevenue stream Recognition policy \nInsurance \npremiums \nCare, health and \nother customer \ncontract revenue \nGross insurance premiums \nGross insurance premiums represent the premiums earned relating to risk exposure for the reported financial year. \nThey comprise gross premiums written, adjusted for the change in provision for unearned premiums that relates to \nperiods of risk in subsequent financial years. Premiums are shown gross of commission payable and net of insurance \npremium taxes that may apply in certain jurisdictions. \nIn circumstances where a return of premiums is likely to be due to policyholders, a provision for the return of \npremium is established within the provision for unearned premiums based on the best estimate of future cash flows. \nThe return of premium is treated as an adjustment to the initial premium, reducing gross insurance premiums. \nPremiums ceded to reinsurers \nPremiums ceded to reinsurers represent reinsurance premiums payable for contracts entered into that relate to risk \nmitigation for the reported ﬁnancial year. These comprise written premiums ceded to reinsurers, adjusted for the \nreinsurers’ share of the movement in the gross provision for unearned premiums. Premiums relating to reinsurance \ntreaties are recognised over the period from inception of a treaty to expiration of the related business on a straight-\nline basis. \nThe Group generates income from the operation of its care homes, hospitals, dental centres and other healthcare and \nwellbeing centres. In instances where Bupa is acting as an agent and another party is primarily responsible for \nfulfilling the contract, revenue is recognised on a net basis. When considering whether the Group is acting as an \nagent or as a principal, factors such as which party is primarily responsible for fulfilling the obligation, bears the \ninventory and credit risk and has discretion in establishing prices are considered. \nThese revenue streams typically relate to short-term services that have fixed, rather than variable, transaction prices \nand there are no significant judgements required when considering the time pattern of revenue recognition. Payment \nterms vary from on completion of the service, to payments made monthly in advance. Bupa has the right to bill and \nreceive payment for services rendered to date. Contracts for these revenue streams do not transfer significant \ninsurance risk. \nThe Sanitas Hospitales and New Services revenue stream includes one public hospital in Spain that is operated under \na separate service concession arrangement granted by the local government (the grantor). Revenue is recognised \nfrom the construction of infrastructure and from the operation of the hospital. Construction revenues are recognised \nin line with the stage of completion of the work performed. Operational revenues are recognised in the period in \nwhich the services are provided, based on the average operating margin for the life of the contract. As revenue is \nbased on an expected margin, with some potential variability, revenue is only recognised to the extent that it is \nhighly probable a significant reversal will not occur when the uncertainty is resolved. Significant changes in margin \nresult in a retrospective margin recalculation. The impact of this on prior years is recognised as a margin catch up in \nthe year the recalculation is performed. \nOther customer contract revenue includes contracts entered into by the Group’s insurance entities that do not result \nin the transfer of signiﬁcant insurance risk to the Group and are accounted for as service contracts. These contracts \nmainly relate to the administration of claims funds on behalf of corporate customers. Revenues from service \ncontracts are recognised as the services are provided. Some of these contracts contain financial liabilities \nrepresenting deposits repayable to the customer. These are measured at amortised cost.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
