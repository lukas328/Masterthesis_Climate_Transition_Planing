It is calculated by estimating the ultimate net \nreduction in claims costs due to the disruption caused by COVID-19, adjusted to take account of incremental costs \nand profit impacts attributable to COVID-19, the estimated costs of deferred claims expected to rebound after the \nreporting date and rebate payments made in 2021 of £110m. The key assumptions in determining the return of \npremium provision are the costs of deferred claims expected to rebound, which has reduced in the level of \nestimation uncertainty since 2021, and COVID-19 related claims inflation expected to be incurred (£24m). It is \nexpected that the deferred claims will be incurred over 2023. The assumed level of deferred claims within the \nrebate is sensitive to the cost of healthcare and customer behaviour. A reasonably possible increase or decrease \nin this assumption results in a decrease/increase in the provision of £8m and an increase/decrease in profit \nbefore taxation by the same amount. \nProvisions for unearned premiums also includes a provision of £45m (2021: £nil) for a premium rate increase \ndeferral in respect of the health insurance business in Australia. In accordance with local accounting standards \nand IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts, a premium rate increase deferral provision is recognised at the point the Group \nannounces a return to policyholders which will be honoured through a rate deferral, and gross written premiums \nrecognised within the Consolidated Income Statement are reduced accordingly. The provision is subsequently \nutilised over the period when the rate deferral is effective. At the reporting date, the amounts provided for are in \nrelation to the announcements made by the Group in December 2022 to return permanent net COVID-19 savings \nto eligible policyholders. \nUnexpired risk provision \nLiability adequacy tests are performed at a portfolio level for the Group’s insurance entities. For short-duration \ncontracts, a premium deficiency is recognised if the sum of expected costs of future claims and claim adjustment \nexpenses, capitalised deferred acquisition costs, and maintenance expenses exceeds the corresponding unearned \npremiums while considering anticipated investment income. Any identified deficiency is charged to the \nConsolidated Income Statement, initially by writing off deferred acquisition costs, and subsequently by \nestablishing an unexpired risk provision for losses arising in excess of deferred acquisition costs. \nAs at 31 December 2022, an unexpired risk provision of £1m has been recognised (2021: £22m). \nProvision for claims \nThe gross provision for claims represents the estimated liability arising from claims episodes in current and \npreceding financial years which have not yet given rise to claims paid. A claims episode is an insured medical \nservice that the Group has an obligation to fund which could be consultation fees, diagnostic investigations, \nhospitalisation or treatment costs. The provision includes an allowance for claims management and handling \nexpenses. The gross provision for claims also includes a deferred claims provision for claims episodes that have not \ntaken place by the reporting date where the Group has a constructive obligation to fund deferred medical services, \ndue to regulatory or other public commitments following periods of severe service disruption, as has been the case \nwith COVID-19. \nThe gross provision for claims across the Group is set in line with Bupa’s claims reserving standards, at a level to \nachieve an appropriate probability of sufficiency and is estimated based on current information and the ultimate \nliability may vary as a result of subsequent information and events. \nAdjustments to the amount of claims provision for prior years are included in the Consolidated Income Statement \nin the financial year in which the change is made. In setting the provisions for claims outstanding, a best estimate \nis determined on an undiscounted basis and then a margin of prudence is added such that there is confidence that \nfuture claims will be met from the provisions. The level of prudence is set based on the historic accuracy of initial \nestimation to ultimate claims, in order to mitigate the degree of uncertainty attached to the underlying provision \nto an appropriate degree of confidence. The level of prudence is set at a Group level, allowing the Group to benefit \nfrom a diversification benefit on the prudence margin held by the individual insurance entities in the Group. \nThe expected claims are calculated having regard only to contracts commencing prior to the reporting date. \nThe methods used and estimates made for claims provisions are reviewed regularly. \nA deferred claims provision of £181m has been recognised as at 31 December 2022 (2021: £163m) in respect of the \nhealth insurance business in Australia, where the Australian prudential regulator (APRA) had mandated the need \nto provide for the\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19<|><|>EVENT<|>COVID-19 pandemic is a global health crisis that significantly impacted health insurance claims, premiums, and financial provisions, including the return of premium provisions and deferred claims in the context of health insurance and related financial activities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUPA<|><|>ORGANIZATION<|>Bupa is a health insurance and healthcare group that manages health insurance policies, provisions, and financial reporting, including provisions related to COVID-19 claims and premiums)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUSTRALIA<|><|>GEO<|>Australia is a country where Bupa's health insurance business operates, with specific provisions for premium rate deferrals and unexpired risk provisions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AURELIA<|><|>GEO<|>A country mentioned in the context of claims and provisions, with references to its policyholders and insurance activities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FIRUZABAD<|><|>GEO<|>Firuzabad is a geographic location referenced in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic's impact, though not directly linked to the insurance activities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KROHAARA<|><|>GEO<|>Krohaara is a capital city in Quintara, mentioned in the context of international relations and financial transactions related to COVID-19)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QATAR<|><|>GEO<|>Qatar is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text, so not identified here>\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19<|><|>EVENT<|>The pandemic caused disruptions leading to provisions for deferred claims, claims inflation, and other financial adjustments in Bupa's health insurance operations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Claims<|><|>EVENT<|>Claims refer to medical services, hospitalizations, and treatments that generate liabilities and provisions in health insurance, especially impacted by COVID-19 disruptions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Claims Management<|><|>ORGANIZATION<|>Claims management involves handling and estimating liabilities for medical claims, including deferred claims due to COVID-19, with standards for reserving and prudence applied)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Australian Prudential Regulator (APRA)<|><|>ORGANIZATION<|>APRA is the regulatory authority overseeing the health insurance provisions in Australia, mandating provisions for deferred claims and other financial measures)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BUPA<|>AUSTRALIA<|>Bupa's health insurance operations in Australia are subject to APRA regulations and involve specific provisions for deferred claims and premium rate deferrals<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19<|>BUPA<|>COVID-19 pandemic caused disruptions leading to increased claims, deferred claims, and adjustments in provisions and estimates<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Claims<|>BUPA<|>Claims are the medical services and treatments for which Bupa has liabilities, affected by COVID-19 and managed through provisions<|>7)\n##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
