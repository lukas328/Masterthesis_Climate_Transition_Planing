We will continue to \nupskill Board Members through dedicated \neducation sessions to enhance their and the wider \nGroup’s knowledge and understanding of climate \nchange risk and opportunities, connected \nregulation and market practice. This training will \nstrengthen the Group’s approach to addressing \nthese matters. We are developing capacity on \nsustainability and climate change amongst our \nleadership group and will look to utilise further \ntraining such as the training carried out by the \nCambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership  \nin 2022. \nOur Phoenix Climate Hub, launched in January \n2022, is an intranet-based platform aiming to \nincrease understanding of climate change impacts, \ncommunicate the Group’s climate strategy and \nprovide useful tools and resources. The educational \nmodules include content exploring the science \nof climate change, how it presents a risk and \nopportunity, deep dives on strategy and how all \ncolleagues can make a day-to-day impact. In May \n2023 we launched an all-colleague sustainability \ntraining programme that focuses on climate action. \nWe will continue to update the content as the \ntransition to net zero unfolds and undertake further \ntraining with teams across the business responsible \nfor managing our work on climate change across \nthe Group. \nWe have continued to engage colleagues across \nthe Group through our Sustainability Network \nand Environmental Champions Group launched \nin 2021. They aim to engage and empower \ncolleagues on positive environmental behaviour. \nOver the course of the 2023 and beyond, these \ncolleagues will play an important part in reducing \nthe impact of our operations by ensuring our \nEnvironmental Management System is run \neffectively; and will work with our Volunteering \nChampions on environmental projects in our \nlocal communities. \nEngaging our colleagues\nWe launched our Electric Vehicle \nScheme in 2022 to offer our colleagues \nthe option of leasing an electric vehicle \nas part of the sustainability benefits we \noffer. This initiative enhances the suite of \nopportunities our colleagues have for \nreducing the impact of their commute to \nthe office. We believe it to be an effective \nway to promote lower emissions and \ncleaner air on a local level and to support \na wider acceleration for the adoption of \nelectric vehicles worldwide. Our other \nlonger-standing incentives include \nseason ticket support and cycle to  \nwork schemes.\nCase study: Employee electric vehicle scheme\n“   We know sustainability is important \nto our colleagues. So implementing \nan electric vehicle leasing scheme \nthat helps them switch to more \nenvironmentally friendly vehicles \nand reduce their carbon footprint \nhas proved popular.
