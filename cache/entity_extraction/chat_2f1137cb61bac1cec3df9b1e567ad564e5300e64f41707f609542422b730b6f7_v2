In general, we have sought \nto estimate absolute emissions based on the following formula prescribed by the PCAF Standard:\nIn February 2020, we set ourselves the challenge to at least halve the climate impact of our financing activity \nby 2030 and align with the 2015 Paris Agreement. Financing activity refers to the loans and investments (debt \nsecurities and equity shares) on NatWest Group’s balance sheet. We use financed emissions as a key metric \nto estimate the climate impact of our financing activity and set a baseline for our climate ambition to align with \nthe 2015 Paris Agreement. Financed emissions are GHG emissions that NatWest Group finances through its \nlending and investment activity. These activities fall within Scope 3, category 15 of the GHG Protocol and are often \nthe most significant part of a financial institution’s climate impact. Financed emissions can be measured as absolute \nemissions or emissions intensities. Absolute emissions, measured as million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per \nyear, reflect the impact of a financial institution’s lending and investment on economic activity e.g. production of \ngoods and services, and related emissions. Emissions intensities can be measured as physical or economic \nemissions intensities. Physical emissions intensities are emissions per physical unit e.g. tonne or kilometre,  \nand are sector-specific. Economic emissions intensities are emissions per £ lending or investment and can \nbe aggregated and compared across sectors.\nEstimating absolute financed emissions and emission intensity enables us to: \n • identify, assess and manage climate-related risks and opportunities, \n • understand the drivers of climate-related transition risks and opportunities in our business, \n • set a baseline for climate action to align with the 2015 Paris Agreement, and the development of the initial \niteration of our climate transition plan,\n • monitor the progress we are making against the initial iteration of our Climate transition plan.\nDuring 2022, we worked on enhancing our capabilities and extending the scope of our financed emission models. \nWe have now analysed 69% of our loans and investment portfolios based on the 2019 balance sheet. Our work \nwas guided by the availability of methodologies for estimating financed emissions, most notably from the SBTi \nand PCAF. Financed emissions are published one year in arrears of our financial reporting date to allow time \nfor appropriate data sourcing and review.\nNatWest Group approach to estimating financed emissions \nData quality: A common theme across all sector models relates to data limitations, including lack of published \nemissions data and granularity of customer information. As a result, the estimates included in this section are premised \non use of assumptions, extrapolations or aggregation at subsector levels. Based on these limitations, we expect our \nestimates of emissions to change as we improve the granularity and coverage of customer climate data and develop \nour methodologies further. See page 80 for a summary of our PCAF data quality scores by sector.\nWe will continue to engage with customers and stakeholders, and participate in wider initiatives, to help enhance \nthe availability of decision useful granular climate-related data for customers. Our measurement work to date has \nreinforced our understanding of the challenges involved in financed emissions calculation as well as the urgency \nand the scale of transition required to align our financing activities to the 2015 Paris Agreement and achieve net \nzero. As outlined in the initial iteration of our Climate transition plan, addressing the climate crisis is not something \nNatWest Group or any individual organisation can do on its own. There is a dependency on the UK Government \nand clear, timely regulatory policy and technology developments, as well as on our customers and society to \nrespond. We have factored these dependencies and associated risks into our transition plan and continue our \nproactive work on policy engagement as well as developing partnerships to support the transition. Refer to  \nsection 3 for details on the initial iteration of our Climate transition plan.\nDuring 2022, we published our sector level targets validated by the SBTi as science-based. The 2030 physical \nemissions intensities included in this section are based on external scenarios which outline policies, technology \ndevelopments and other changes required to achieve the 2030 estimates. We will continue our work on enhancing \nour measurement capabilities and, over time, we expect climate data granularity to improve as we move towards \nutilising actual customer climate data.\nAttribution factor: The PCAF Standard requires a financial institution’s share of absolute emissions to \nbe proportional to the borrower’s or investee’s total (company or project) value. According to the GHG Protocol, \nabsolute GHG emissions from loans and investments are allocated or attributed to the reporting financial institutions \nbased on the proportional share of loans and investments in the borrower or investee. The attribution factor is \ncalculated by determining the share of the outstanding amount of loans and investments of a financial institution \nover the total equity and debt of the borrower or investee company. \nEstimation of emission intensity: To calculate physical emissions intensity, the physical output unit was calculated \nbased on customer production data (where available) or production proxies such as an average production-to-\nrevenue factor for customers with similar operations in the sector. This metric assumes that customers in a given \nsector have similar cost/revenue structures and that the sector operates essentially as a free market, absent of \nmonopoly rents. Economic emissions intensities refer to absolute emissions per pound of lending or investment. \nThese are calculated as a metric to help NatWest Group assess the marginal impact of its lending to its Scope 3, \ncategory 15 GHG emissions. This metric assumes that the marginal impact of a pound lent or invested for that \nsector does not depend on existing financing in the sector. In other words, each additional or marginal pound of \nlending or investment to a customer in that sector, results in the same\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
