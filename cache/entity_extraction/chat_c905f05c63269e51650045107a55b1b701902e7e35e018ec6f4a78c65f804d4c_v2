We are less likely to become aware of \ninstances of non-compliance with laws and regulations \nthat are not closely related to events and transactions \nreflected in the financial statements. Also, the risk of not \ndetecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher \nthan the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, \nas fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for \nexample, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, \nor through collusion. \nOur audit testing might include testing complete \npopulations of certain transactions and balances, \npossibly using data auditing techniques. However, it \ntypically involves selecting a limited number of items \nfor testing, rather than testing complete populations. \nWe will often seek to target particular items for \ntesting based on their size or risk characteristics. \nIn other cases, we will use audit sampling to enable \nus to draw a conclusion about the population from \nwhich the sample is selected. \nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit \nof the financial statements is located on the FRC’s \nwebsite at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. \nThis description forms part of our auditors’ report. \nUse of this report \nThis report, including the opinions, has been prepared \nfor and only for the Company’s members as a body in \naccordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies \nAct 2006 and for no other purpose.

The \nperiod of total uninterrupted engagement is 2 years, \ncovering the years ended 31 December 2021 to 31 \nDecember 2022. \nOther voluntary reporting \nDirectors’ remuneration \nThe Company voluntarily prepares a Directors' \nremuneration report in accordance with the provisions \nof the Companies Act 2006.
