Disclosure \nof transition plans of real-economy firms, including the detailed assumptions and data that underpins \nthem, enables effective engagement and capital allocation across the financial ecosystem. \nGFANZ aims to improve this data flow by increasing the implementation and disclosure of transition \nplans by real-economy companies. The Expectations for Real-economy Transition Plans report serves \nas a practical guide for financial institutions engaging with real-economy companies and for these \ncompanies when building transition plans and disclosing progress against them. The report provides \nclarity regarding the data financial institutions expect from their real economy clients and portfolio \ncompanies. Rather than inventing a new framework, the report uses existing guidance and frameworks \nto arrive at the themes, components, and sub-elements financial institutions expect in real-economy \ntransition plans.\n \nExample 11. Aviva’s engagement program with teeth\nSub-sector: Insurer\nIn its Climate Transition Plan ,197 Aviva describes how its engagement program relates to its ambition and strategy, \nand “has teeth” in order to drive the transition to net-zero emissions.\nThe company discusses its Aviva Investors (AI)-led climate engagement escalation program, which is focused on \n30 systemically important carbon emitters in the oil and gas, metals and mining, and utilities sectors held in its \ninvestment portfolios. Aviva is prepared to send a message to all companies through voting actions when those \ncompanies do not have adequate climate plans or do not act quickly enough. \nENGAGEMENT STRATEGY\nCONTENTS  |  FINANCIAL INSTITUTION NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLANS — FUNDAMENTALS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND GUIDANCE\n65\nAviva emphasizes the importance of engaging in the first instance, while considering divesting where necessary: \n“[I]t’s crucial to pair emissions reduction targets with engagement targets to encourage the decarbonisation of \nour investees rather than just divesting and switching to lower carbon emitting sectors.” 198 \n198 Ibid., p. 15.\n199 Ibid., p. 19.\n200 AXA IM Corporate.

Foreword 2. Our ambition and strategy 4. Embedding Climate Risk3. Delivering on our pledges 5. Using our influence\nAviva’s approach aims to encourage ambitious transition strategies, plans, and progress from portfolio companies, \nwith an escalation framework when engagement is ineffective.\nAviva reported that, in 2021, AI undertook 112 engagements (meetings and written communication) with the \n30 companies in scope and recorded 95 engagement “wins,” which it defined as improvements in one of the \nfollowing: targets, transition plan, governance, disclosures, or lobbying. 199 \nExample 12.
