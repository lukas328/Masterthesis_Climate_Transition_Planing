Our GLT sponsors evaluate \nchanges to their risks to better understand our exposure. When necessary, they order these \nrisks by importance and create targeted mitigation strategies.\nOver the last year, we have continued to update our principal risks, clarifying associated \nopportunities and priority actions:\n• Three risks have been removed as principal risks – ‘Intellectual Property’ (IP), ‘Ethics and \nCompliance’ and ‘Customer Contract Liability’. We consider the controls put in place over \nthe past year to be effectively mitigating the risks\n• We have introduced two new principal risks: ‘A significant geopolitical or macroeconomic \nevent impacting JM’s operations’ and ‘Failure to deliver business value from strategic \ncapital projects’.\nThe principal risks we face are listed alongside the measures we’ve taken to reduce them on \nthe following pages. These risks could materially harm our company’s operations, either alone \nor in combination. \nEach of our strategic principal risks, if handled effectively, carries a significant opportunity \nto deliver above stakeholder expectations.

These shifts could \nimpact both our existing products (e.g. in Clean Air) and \nproducts which are expected to drive JM’s future growth \n(e.g. in Hydrogen Technologies); there is a risk that \nthese shifts could be slower or faster than anticipated\n• Risk that we fail to make the right decisions in response \nto these shifts, mostly in terms of capital allocation \n(e.g. R&D, capital expenditure).\nIf we correctly anticipate future \nmarket shifts and respond adequately, \nwe can create value from the \ntransition to the low-carbon economy \nthrough increased revenues \nand profits.\nThrough our products and services we \nhave an opportunity to affect climate \nchange, nature and society.\n• We continue to monitor the changing market \nenvironment (e.g. technology choices, pace \nof commoditisation) and our customers’ \nrequirements. Using this information and our \nscenario-based approach, we can update our \nstrategic plans and actions where needed\n• We keep investing in innovation to make sure \nwe have products that differentiate us in all our \nmarkets, meeting our customers’ specific needs \nwhen required\n• For our maturing businesses, we have a plan \nto reduce our cost base to improve efficiency and \ncash flow\n• For our growth businesses, we plan to invest in our \nproduction assets and are working to mitigate the \nrisks associated with this (principal risk 3)\nFormerly ‘Strategic growth: business transition \nto low-carbon economy’. \nRisk re-titled to reflect the risk that we may not \nhave a viable business model in the face of \nrapidly commoditising sustainable technologies, \nposing a risk to some legacy products and \nservices that are designed for a declining market.\nRisk reduced due to the achievements of some \nstrategic objectives, e.g. partnership with \nPlug Power.\nWe have continued our investment in growth \nplatforms – particularly in Hydrogen \nTechnologies and Catalyst Technologies.\n2 A significant geopolitical or macroeconomic event impacting JM’s operations GLT sponsor: Christian Günther\nRisk Opportunity Key mitigations Updates made to principal risk \nDue to the nature of JM’s global footprint, there is a risk that \nwe may face disruption in our operations, supply chain and \n/ or customer markets due to geopolitical events.
