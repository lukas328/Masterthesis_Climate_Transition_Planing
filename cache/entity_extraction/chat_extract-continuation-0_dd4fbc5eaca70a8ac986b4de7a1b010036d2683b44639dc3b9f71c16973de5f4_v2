We are a supply \nchain services company and as such the downstream limit of our emissions is often the delivery point of our \ncustomers’ product(s). However, we use sub-contract road freight, rail freight and ferries to meet our service \nobligations to our customers and have included estimated scope 3 emissions from these sources.\nEmissions are calculated from spend reports, Government average annual fuel price figures, and \nbenchmarking data provided by Logistics UK. Deployment of our cloud-based transport planning and \ntransport control tower systems has given us the scope to change the methodology for calculating \ndownstream transport and distribution emissions and we anticipate advances in our calculation methodology \nin the coming year.\nUpstream transportation and distribution - Wincanton are not a product company. We are a supply chain \nservices company and as such the upstream transportation and distribution to the warehouse facilities we \nmanage is owned by our customers or their suppliers and we get involved only if they award that business \nto us, in which case the associated emissions will be included in the scope 1 and/or scope 3 emissions figure. \nWhere we are awarded this work, we may use sub-contract road freight; rail freight and ferries to meet our \nservice obligations and have included estimated scope 3 emissions from these sources in our “downstream” \ncalculations. We have not included any emissions from the manufacture or construction of the transport and \nproperty assets that we utilise either upstream or downstream.\nWaste - Wincanton manages its waste very closely; sends zero waste to landfill; and has made long term \ntarget commitments for minimising and recycling residual waste. Much of the waste materials we handle \nresults from decisions made by our customers and they and Wincanton both measure waste in terms of \nweights and types rather than converting it to scope 3 emissions. We believe the effectiveness of our waste \nprogramme is better served by maintaining waste as a physical commodity rather than assigning an emissions \nimpact. However, for the purposes of this carbon reduction plan, we have used our annual waste quantity and \nthe Defra/BEIS 2020-2022 carbon factors to estimate the associated scope 3 emissions for each year.\nThese are transport only and do not include waste processing emissions in the calculation process which  \nis still under consideration and development and relies on supplier provided data for the calculation.\nEmployee commuting - Wincanton has over 170 operating locations and the nature of the contract  \nsupply chain sector means that these locations are often defined by our customers’ and their  \ndistribution networks. \nAlthough we cannot change the location of our sites easily, Wincanton encourages the use of car sharing, \ncycling and public transport but does not aggregate and track their impacts nationally but only at local, site \nlevel when colleagues wish to do so to drive specific project evaluation or a sustainability initiative.\nEmployee travel to work is featured in many site CI plans as a scope 3 emission reduction opportunity and \nmay be included in our annual “Environment Week” colleague engagement activities.\nEmissions from employee commuting are not included in our “net-zero 2040” target because we have little \ninfluence on them or ability to reduce them. However, for the purposes of this carbon reduction plan we \nhave included them in our data, tables and graphs. We have used our end of year FTE figure for each year \nto estimate our employee commuting emissions from UK average figures on employment and emissions \nprovided by ONS and CBI. Wincanton will develop a more scalable calculation methodology over time, \nprobably based on travel surveys for a selected proportion of the largest 25 sites we operate which host 65% \nof our 20,005 colleagues.\nScope 3 emissions explanatory notes\n9\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>WINCANTON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Wincanton is a supply chain services company that manages transportation, distribution, waste, and employee commuting activities, and reports on associated scope 3 emissions to support its sustainability goals)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOVERNMENT<|>GEO<|>Government provides fuel price data and benchmarking information used by Wincanton to calculate emissions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOGISTICS UK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Logistics UK is an industry benchmarking organization that provides data used by Wincanton for emissions calculations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLOUD-BASED TRANSPORT PLANNING SYSTEM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Wincanton's cloud-based systems that enable transport management and methodology improvements for calculating downstream emissions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EMPLOYEE COMMUTING<|>EVENT<|>Employee travel to work activities at Wincanton's locations, contributing to scope 3 emissions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WASTE MANAGEMENT<|>EVENT<|>Wincanton's practices of waste minimization, recycling, and zero waste to landfill, impacting environmental footprint)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRANSPORTATION<|>EVENT<|>Road freight, rail freight, and ferries used by Wincanton to meet service obligations, contributing to scope 3 emissions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UPSTREAM TRANSPORTATION<|>EVENT<|>Transportation activities owned by customers or suppliers that deliver goods to Wincanton's warehouse facilities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DOWNSTREAM TRANSPORTATION<|>EVENT<|>Transportation activities involved in delivering products from Wincanton to customers, including subcontracted freight)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WINCANTON<|>GOVERNMENT<|>Uses government fuel price data and benchmarking info for emissions calculations<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WINCANTON<|>LOGISTICS UK<|>Uses benchmarking data provided by Logistics UK for emissions estimation<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WINCANTON<|>TRANSPORTATION<|>Uses subcontracted road, rail, and ferry services to meet delivery obligations<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WINCANTON<|>UPSTREAM TRANSPORTATION<|>Provides transportation services owned by customers or suppliers<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WINCANTON<|>DOWNSTREAM TRANSPORTATION<|>Provides transportation services to deliver products to customers, often subcontracted<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WINCANTON<|>EMPLOYEE COMMUTING<|>Employees commute to work at Wincanton's locations, contributing to scope 3 emissions<|>5)\n##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
