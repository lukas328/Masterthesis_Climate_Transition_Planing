See section 5.1 for \nfurther detail on heightened climate-related risk sectors. \n • As a member of the Powering Past Coal Alliance, we aim to support \nthe organisation’s goal to advance the transition from unabated coal \npower generation to clean energy, and continue to phase-out of coal, \nin line with our 2024 and 2030 ambitions.\n(1) Refer to pages 38 to 39 of the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative’s Initial Target Disclosure Report (May 2022).\n(2) For AuM, carbon intensity is calculated as tons of Scope 1 and Scope 2 carbon emissions per $1 million of sales. This is measured for \nequity holdings only which, as at 31 December 2022, made up 52.5% of overall AuM. Carbon intensity data is sourced from Morningstar \nat the underlying fund level. Carbon intensity is aggregated at the fund/portfolio level, then weighted based on AuM for 31 December \n2022. To produce a carbon intensity reduction figure, a comparison is done at the fund/portfolio level only against baseline fund/portfolio \ndata, then weighted based on 31 December 2022 AuM for all in-scope AuM. As a result, the movement in AuMs between 31 December \n2022 and the 31 December 2019 baseline has not been considered. Where external data is unavailable and where deemed appropriate, \nproxies are selected that match the fund characteristics. Figure reported is based on external data as at 30 September 2022.\n(3) As at 31 December 2022, £138.8 billion, 68%, of the total residential mortgages portfolio had EPC data available. \n(*) Within scope of EY assurance.

As part of \nthe Sustainable Homes and Buildings Coalition, we engaged on the \nneed to improve the energy efficiency of the UK’s housing stock, \nfocusing on how this can be accelerated. \n • Engaged with peers, policy makers and stakeholders through \nGFANZ, Transition Plan Taskforce, NZBA, Financial Markets Stability \nBoard and NZAM initiative to facilitate a net-zero transition. \n • We will continue to enhance our partnerships to create opportunities \nfor supporting customer transition. These include:\n • Working with Places for People, British Gas Centrica and \nSchneider Electric - coordinated by Pineapple Sustainable \nPartnerships - to work together on a pilot project to show that \nretrofitting homes at scale can be an achievable and affordable \ngoal.\n • Exploring how we can work with the Supply Chain Sustainability \nSchool to share the knowledge and build the skills needed to \nretrofit homes across the UK.\nGetting our own house in order\nEach year, we plan to include targets for executive remuneration that \nreflect our latest climate ambitions.\n • Climate considerations continue to be included in senior executive \nremuneration and as part of the bonus pool assessment for our \nwider workforce, recognising its central role in our strategy.\n • Refer to the Directors’ Remuneration Report in the 2022 Annual \nReport and Accounts for further details.\n • We will continue to embed climate in decision-making including \nregular monitoring of progress against our climate ambitions.\nWe plan to continue the integration of the financial and non-financial \nrisks arising from climate change into our enterprise-wide risk \nmanagement framework (EWRMF).\n • Increasing use of quantification in risk assessments with enhanced \nanalytics capabilities under development for integration in the EWRMF.\n • Enhancement of core strategic climate risk modelling capabilities and \ninitial integration into risk management and customer journeys.\n • Work will continue to further integrate climate-related risk across \nbusiness processes to achieve full integration within risk management \nand decision-making.\nWe have a target to reduce our direct own operations emissions by \n50% by 2025, against a 2019 baseline.\n • We reduced our direct own operations emissions by 46%, against \na 2019 baseline.\n • We plan to continue emission reductions within our direct own \noperations, alongside investments to mitigate greenhouse gas \nemissions, in line with SBTi guidance. \nWe plan to use only renewable electricity in our direct own global \noperations by 2025 (RE100) and improve our energy productivity 40% \nby 2025 against a 2015 baseline (EP100).\n • We increased our consumption of renewable electricity to 98% across \nour global operations. For operations in the UK and Republic of \nIreland, electricity consumption used 100% renewable electricity.\n • Energy productivity has increased by 41% since 2015, and electricity \nconsumption decreased by 8% since 2021.\n • We intend to work with our principal landlords to advocate for \nrenewable electricity provision for all properties.\n • Our aim is to maintain energy efficiency improvements following \na safe return to office-based working.\nWe plan to install electric vehicle charging infrastructure in 15% of large \noffice\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
