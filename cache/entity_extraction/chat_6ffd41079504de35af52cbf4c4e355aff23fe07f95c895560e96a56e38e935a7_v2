We pay special attention \nto the Amazon and Cerrado biomes, where the risks of \ndeforestation, impacts on biodiversity, and other environ-\nmental and social risks are recurring problems affecting \ndifferent production chains.\nIn 2022, besides the advances in the traceability of our \ndirect suppliers, we started the traceability and socioenvi-\nronmental monitoring of indirect suppliers. These present \na particular challenge, not only for BRF, but for the entire \ncommodities sector . \nWe achieved 100% treaceability and socioenvironmental \nmonitoring of our direct suppliers from the Amazon and \nCerrado biomes to farm level. For indirect suppliers, we \nachieved 45% treaceability in the same criteria. By doing \nso, we achieved 61% of our commitment to “Ensure \ntreaceability of 100% of the grains purchased from \nAmazon and Cerrado biomes by 2025”, in the second year \nof the implementation process. \nTo be more transparent with our stakeholders in \nrelation to the criteria used in the monitoring process, \nwe published the Sustainable Grain Purchase Policy. \nSuppliers that are non-compliant with our Policy are \npreventively blocked, and then contacted to provide \nclarifications about the non-conformities found. In 2022, \nwe blocked 189 suppliers from our historical base from \nfuture negotiations. The main reason for the blocking was \ndue to the appearance on Ibama’s Embargoes List.\n100%\n of the volumes purchased \nfrom the Amazon and Cerrado\n biomes are monitored using \nsocio-environmental criteria and \ndeforestation at Farm Level.\nTo evaluate cases of non-compliance with the criteria of \nour Policy, in 2021, we created the Grains Sustainability \nMultidisciplinary Committee.  Composed of the Commod-\nities, Reputation and Sustainability, Legal and Compliance \nteams, the Committee is responsible for the decision-\nmaking on whether to continue or end the relationship \nwith these partners, by evaluating the associated risks. \nIn 2022, 14 cases were evaluated by the Committee, of \nwhich 10 were blocked and/or had their negotiations \nterminated, whilst with the other four we reached agree-\nments for improvements as a result of the evaluation. \n1  Direct suppliers: deliver directly to BRF, as is the case with rural producers.\n2  Indirect suppliers: these are intermediaries in the purchase and sale process, \ninvolving traders, cooperatives, cereal farmers, crushers and other business \nentities.\n3  Historical base: all the suppliers of grains already registered in the BRF \ndatabase.\n89\nValue Generation5\nOur way of \ndoing business\nOur strategy\nCulture and \nEngagement\nIndicators  \nand annex\n3\n4\n6\n2\nPresentation1\n2022 Integrated  \nReport\nSocio-environmental Criteria Monitored:\nNominal Criteria • Embargoes: IBAMA, ICMBIO, SEMA\nTerritorial Criteria • Overlapping with: IBAMA, ICMBIO, SEMA\n•  Infringement onto: Conservation Units (CUs), \nEnvironmental Protection Areas (EPAs)\nDeforestation •  Amazon: zero deforestation after July 2008\n•  Cerrado: illegal deforestation after December 2008\n•  PRODES Amazon and Cerrado\nSocial • Blacklist of Work Similar to Slavery published by the \nMinistry of Labor and Employment (MTE) \n• Overlapping with:: Settlements, Quilombolas and \nIndigenous Peoples’ Lands\nBiodiversity •  Avoid, minimize and/or compensate any adverse impacts \non the local biodiversity arising from the operations\n2021 \nImplementation \nof the System\n2021\n75% of direct \nsuppliers \ntraceability\n2021 \nPublication of the \nSustainable Grain \nPurchasing Policy\n2022 \nDefinition of \nthe Indirect \nSuppliers \nprocess\n2022  \nPublication \nof the Grains \nSustainable \nSupplier \nBooklet. \n2025  \n100% of \ntraceability and \nsocioenvironmental \nmonitoring.\n2022  \nTracking: 100% of \nDirect Suppliers\n45% of Indirect \nSuppliers\nNet Zero  \n2040\n75%\n100%\n100%\n45%\nGrains Treceability and Socio-environmental Monitoring\nAMAZON\nCERRADO\nDirect Suppliers \n100% Direct Suppliers\n100%\nIndirect Suppliers\n43% Indirect Suppliers\n45%\n90\nValue Generation5\nOur way of \ndoing business\nOur strategy\nCulture and \nEngagement\nIndicators  \nand annex\n3\n4\n6\n2\nPresentation1\n2022 Integrated  \nReport\nCommunities and \nsocial impact  GRI 2-29, 413-1\nBRF Institute \nGRI 3-3: Material Topic (Food safety)  GRI 203-1, 203-2\nThe\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
