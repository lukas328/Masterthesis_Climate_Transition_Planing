It will be deployed on those \nfleets where it will provide sustainable value in network optimization.\nWe continue to evaluate, trial, and adopt, when appropriate, alternative fuels including electric vehicles, biomethane, and  \nhydro-treated vegetable oil (HVO) and we anticipate significant collaborative investment with our customers in electric and \nalternative fueled vehicles and infrastructure. Initially, over the next 5 to 10 years, we expect that for heavier trucks this will be \nin HVO and biomethane with electrification of our smaller, rigid vehicles. During FY2023 we utilised 1.5m litres of HVO and we \nrecently announced the deployment of 30 electric vehicles up to 16.7t on our two-person home delivery network. \nIn 5 to 10 years and beyond we believe that heavier HGVs with battery electric and hydrogen fuel cell drive trains will become \ncommercially available and will begin to achieve widespread deployment after 2030. We have been participating in the ‘Zero \nEmission Road Freight Demonstration’ (ZERFD) funding competition administered by Innovate UK. We hope that ZERFD funding \nwill allow us to implement zero emission, 40t+ tractor units, at a total operating cost comparable to diesel and these should be on \nthe road no later than March 2025.\nIn the shorter term, we are on course to have an all-electric company car fleet by 2026 supported by the necessary workplace \ncharging infrastructure at the appropriate sites. Currently 30% of our company cars and 79% of open car orders are pure electric.\nCarbon reduction plan - July 2023 6\nWarehouse and infrastructure\nOn the warehouse side we have completed various projects to upgrade to sensor-controlled LED lighting across our portfolio \nand continue to upgrade lighting at every opportunity e.g. when we add a new customer site to our portfolio. Warehouse energy \nefficiency, waste reduction and packaging projects are included on mandatory continuous Improvement (CI) plans across the \nbusiness and are led by our operations in collaboration with the customer.\nWe source green tariff electricity from Renewable Energy Guarantee of Origin (REGO) backed renewable sources where we have \nthe supply contract. We are now implementing a programme of solar photovoltaic (PV) panel installation across our estate working \nwith our landlords. We anticipate first completed project will be during summer 2023. Where possible, the solar PV arrays will be \nsized to reflect the potential electrification of our transport assets and the increased electricity demand, power capacity and power \nmanagement that this will entail.\nIndirect Emissions\nWith respect to our indirect (scope 3) emissions we make efforts to reduce these through the sub-contract, sustainable \nprocurement and travel policies that we deploy. Sub-contract transport (“downstream transport and distribution”) is a priority \nhere because our sub-contract policy and volume has a proportional impact on our scope 1 emissions. We are developing new and \nmore accurate ways to measure our scope 3 emissions utilizing systems such as our transport control tower product to reflect the \nincreasing importance of these indirect emissions in our mix.\nAppendix 1 give more detail regarding each category of indirect, scope 3 emission source included in this disclosure.\nMore information about all aspects of the Wincanton ESG programme are available in our Annual Reports available at  \nResults, reports and presentations | Wincanton plc\nCarbon reduction plan - July 2023 7Carbon reduction plan - July 2023\nDeclaration and sign off\nDeclaration and sign off\nThis Carbon Reduction Plan has been completed in accordance with PPN 06/21 and associated guidance and reporting standard for \nCarbon Reduction Plans.\nCarbon emissions have been reported and recorded in accordance with the published reporting standard for Carbon Reduction \nPlans and the GHG Reporting Protocol corporate standard1 and uses the appropriate, 2022, UK Government emission conversion \nfactors for greenhouse gas company reporting2.\nScope 1 and 2 emissions have been reported in accordance with Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting (SECR) requirements. \nThe required subset of scope 3 emissions have been reported in accordance with the published reporting standard for Carbon \nReduction Plans and the Corporate Value Chain (scope 3) Standard3.\nThis Carbon Reduction Plan has been reviewed and signed off by the Executive Management Team.\n \nApproved on behalf of Wincanton:\n8\n1 https://ghgprotocol.org/corporate-standard \n2 https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/government-conversion-factors-for-company-reporting \n3 https://ghgprotocol.org/standards/scope-3-standard \nJames Wroath \nChief Executive Officer\nJuly 2023\nCarbon reduction plan - July 2023\nAppendix 1\nBusiness travel - Air and rail travel included.
