The Board and its \nCommittees are closely monitoring management’s \nimplementation of the 3x6 strategy and are pleased \nwith the progress made to date, particularly against \na challenging backdrop of the current global macro-\neconomic environment. \nThe strategy requires Bupa to change at pace and \nit is important to ensure that this is achieved without \ncompromising our risk management and control \nenvironment. The Risk Committee is closely monitoring \nthis. The Remuneration Committee has ensured that \nremuneration performance measures reflect our \nstrategic objectives and good risk management. \nThe Board has responded quickly to the challenges \nthe business is facing such as managing the difficult \noperating environment for the Isapre business in Chile, \nand supporting LUX MED in its healthcare support to \nUkrainian refugees in Poland. \nSupporting our people and customers \nWe are a customer-centric business and our people are \nkey to us providing a high standard of service and care \nto our customers. As well as implementing our strategy \nto start achieving our customer-focused ambition KPIs, \nthe Board has endorsed further proposals from our \nAustralian Health Insurance business to return COVID-19 \nrelated savings in cash to customers. \nWe have responded to the cost of living crisis through \nactions to support our employees which were targeted \nto the local situation in each market. We also launched \nViva, a new employee health and wellbeing programme \nthat will provide healthcare benefits to 100% of Bupa’s \nemployees globally by the end of 2023. \nSustainability \nSustainability is a key pillar of our 3x6 strategy and \nour new sustainability strategy began to be developed \nin 2021 to drive its achievement. The sustainability \nstrategy was reviewed by the Board Sustainability \nCommittee and approved by the Board in the first half \nof 2022. I am extremely proud that Bupa is taking a lead \nin this area, focusing on the intersection of human and \nplanetary health. This embodies our extended purpose \nof ‘living longer, healthier, happier lives and making a \nbetter world’. \nBoard changes \nWe said farewell to Clare Thompson during the year \nand I would like to thank her for her exceptional \ncontribution to the Bupa Board over the past seven \nyears, both as Audit Committee Chair and as Senior \nIndependent Director. Paul Evans became Senior \nIndependent Director and Audit Committee Chair on 1 \nMay 2022, following Clare’s retirement from the Board. \nRecruitment was well under way for two additional \nNon-Executive Directors (NEDs) at the date of last \nyear’s Annual Report and I am delighted that this \nresulted in the appointments of Gunjan Bhow and \nSally Clark to the Board as NEDs in April and July 2022 \nrespectively. These appointments are in addition to that \nof Pia Heidenmark Cook who also joined the Board as a \nNED in April 2022 as explained in last year’s Annual \nReport. Pia and Gunjan bring a wealth of fantastic \nexperience in sustainability and digital transformation \nrespectively and Sally brings additional financial \nservices, people development and risk management \nexpertise. We are very much looking forward to \nworking with them over the coming years. This \nrecruitment activity has ensured that the Board \nhas the right skill set to appropriately challenge and \noversee management’s delivery of the strategy. \nThe composition of each Committee of the Board has \nbeen reviewed and refreshed during the year to appoint \nPia, Gunjan and Sally to the Committees that will best \nutilise their skill sets and to provide greater flexibility \nby increasing the size of some of the Committees. \nWe are also in the process of identifying an additional \nNED and a successor to Caroline Silver as Chair of the \nRisk Committee as she will complete her second three-\nyear term as a NED later in 2023. See the Nomination \n& Governance Committee’s report on page 76 for \nmore information. \nFocus for 2023 \nIn 2023, the Board will continue to oversee the \nimplementation of the 3x6 strategy, ensuring that \nmanagement adapt it to navigate the risks and \nopportunities presented by the current macro-\neconomic environment. Board succession will also \nbe a focus, in particular identifying our new Risk \nCommittee Chair. \nRoger Davis \nChairman \nBupa Annual Report 2022 50\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
