\nbiodiversity\nRespecting and promoting human \nrights, continuing to improve safety \nperformance, and traceability of our \nmaterials�\n 1898\nHans Søren Hansen buys \na blacksmith shop. \nVestas Sustainability Report 2022\nIn brief General GovernanceEnvironment Sustainability dataSocial Appendix\n5\nDear Vestas stakeholder,\nThe dual threats of catastrophic climate change and energy scarcity \nspurred by Russia’s war of aggression have revived society’s focus \non energy, especially the urgent need to accelerate the sustainable \nenergy transition � \nVestas technology already plays a major part in the solution to these \ncrises� The turbines produced and shipped by Vestas in 2022 alone \nwill avoid 408 million tonnes of CO 2e emissions over their operation -\nal lifetime � And they will do so while reducing energy bills, driving job \ncreation, and building energy independence � Across the world, \nanalysts, policy-makers, and NGO’s are betting that renewable \nenergy sources, especially wind energy, will become the backbone of \nthe green transition � In order to keep global carbon emissions in line \nwith the Paris Agreement, wind energy installations will need to \nquadruple by the end of this decade � \nWhile we are proud of the impact we have enabled so far, we remain \naware of the challenges ahead � To scale our sustainable energy \nsolutions at the pace required to meet global climate goals, we must \nA business \nstrategy rooted \nin sustainability\nExecutive statement\npartner strategically with customers, suppliers, and even competi -\ntors to mature our supply chain and local manufacturing capabilities � \nA technology and energy transition of this magnitude leaves room \nfor many players, and we must work strategically with key partners \nto be successful in our scaling ambitions �\nAs we collaboratively scale-up for the energy transition, we must \nalso ensure we do so sustainably, meeting the present needs of a \ndiverse set of stakeholders without compromising the needs of \nfuture generations � In 2020, we formalised this commitment with \nour first global sustainability strategy entitled “Sustainability in \neverything we do �” This strategy includes the entire value chain, \nunlocking the full decarbonisation potential of wind energy while \nminimising its potential negative impacts on our environment and \nour societies � \nThe strategy consists of four key pillars � \nFirst, we are committed to achieving carbon neutrality across our \nown operations by 2030 – without using carbon offsets, requiring \nthat all of our offices, factories, vehicles, vessels, and other operations \n6\nVestas Sustainability Report 2022\nIn brief General GovernanceEnvironment Sustainability dataSocial Appendix\nare fully decarbonised through our own actions � At the same time, \nwe are working to decarbonise the entire wind energy supply chain \nby working with strategic suppliers to lower the carbon intensity of \nour turbines by 45 percent by 2030 � We will achieve this through \nchanges in turbine design, procurement of materials, and decarbon -\nising the infrastructure to transport and service our wind farms � \nSecond, we are committed to creating zero-waste wind turbines by \n2040� Through our industry-leading Circularity Roadmap, we have \noutlined our pathway and interim targets towards this goal, \nincluding a commitment to create technically and commercially \nrecyclable turbine blades, increase our material efficiency by 90 \npercent, decrease our supply chain waste by 50 percent, and \nincrease our refurbished component utilisation rate to 55 percent, \nall by 2030�\nThird, we are focused on a socially responsible energy transition � To \ncontinue our decades long emphasis on safety, we are working to \nfurther reduce our injury rate 85 percent by 2030 � To build a more \ninclusive energy sector, we will increase the share of women in \nleadership positions to 30 percent by 2030 � And to support the \ncommunities that are impacted by our activities, we have committed \nto reach 35,000 community beneficiaries through our corporate \nsocial responsibility projects by 2025 �\nFinally, we aim to lead the transition to a world powered by sustaina -\nble energy by electrifying new sectors, including using Power-to-X \ntechnologies, and publicly campaigning to drive sustainable change �\nDespite the urgent demand for renewable energy and our pioneering \nsustainability strategy, we remain in an extremely challenged \nbusiness environment � This year, all western OEM’s producing wind \nturbines are doing so at a financial loss, a situation that threatens to \nthwart our progress towards bolstering energy security and driving \ndecarbonisation � The systemic challenges that currently face the \nenergy transition require systemic solutions � To build a world that \nruns on renewable power, energy systems must be redesigned and \noptimised for renewable power generation, permitting must be \nstreamlined, and the renewable industry must be able to capture \nenough value to reinvest into building scale �\nThrough 40 years of technological innovation, pioneering spirit, and \nextraordinary passion, Vestas has become the global leader in sus- \ntainable energy solutions � But as we prepare for the massive scale- \nup required to combat climate change and secure energy independ -\nence, we will now partner with strategic customers, suppliers, and \nbusiness partners who share our vision for a world powered by \nsustainable energy � We are already inspired by the immense \nsupport, engagement, and collaboration of our strategic partners, \nand aim to prioritise and strengthen these relationships moving \nforward � In doing so, we will collaboratively build a sustainable and \nresilient energy system, and a better future for our living planet �\nSincerely,\nVestas Executive Management team\nHenrik Andersen\nGroup President,
