culture is not a \ndestination but a journey� We continually focus on \nstrengthening our policies, processes, training, \nand communication around business ethics to \nfoster a culture of integrity� T o achieve this, \nsetting the right tone at the top to demonstrate \nour management’s commitment to business \nethics is crucial� \nPromoting a culture  \nof integrity\nOur approach to business conduct\nBoard of Directors: Audit Committee\nCommitment to promoting business ethics is embedded at the \nhighest level of the organisation: in the Audit Committee (AC) of  \nthe Vestas Board of Directors � The AC is responsible for monitoring, \npromoting, and assessing our culture of integrity � It evaluates the \nadequacy and effectiveness of our Anti-Bribery and Corruption \n(ABC) Compliance programmes and – if deficiencies are identified \n– ensures implementation of necessary actions to cover risks � The \nAC is also responsible for overseeing the Code of Conduct and \nCorporate Social Responsibility initiatives � \nTone from the top: executive management and senior leadership \nThe Executive Management team, Regional Management, and our \npeople managers all seek to promote a culture of integrity through \ntown halls and other meetings where they address topics within the \nCode of Conduct such as the trust in management and speak up \nculture � Furthermore, compliance is addressed in quarterly meetings \nbetween the Regional and Executive Management teams to ensure \nthat our leadership oversees progress made by each region in the \nABC Compliance programme and other related initiatives � On a \nyearly basis, Regional Management and Global Compliance meet \nand discuss initiatives based on the results of the Global ABC \nSurvey� These meetings highlight each region’s key compliance risks \nand action points for the coming year and give management an \nactive role in drafting the ABC Compliance programmes �\nGlobal and regional compliance programmes\nOur ABC Compliance programmes are built around our business \nethics standards and establish how we map and prioritise activities \nthat support a culture of integrity � Each programme describes  \nhow Global Compliance and Regional Legal & Compliance work  \nwith ABC Compliance in accordance with international anti-corrup -\ntion legislation � \nThe ABC programme comprises five pillars: Programme Governance; \nLearning & Awareness and Culture & Behaviour, which aim to prevent \nmisconduct and promote a culture of integrity; and Monitoring & \nAuditing and EthicsLine, which detect and manage misconduct � \nIn 2022, we ran the Global ABC Survey a second time � This anony -\nmous survey asked all our office employees and service technicians \nabout their perception of bribery and corruption risks � Among other \nquestions, employees were also asked how comfortable they felt \nraising corruption concerns with their manager and to identify the \ntop three compliance risks �\nApproximately 49 percent of the invited employees replied and \nmore than 3,000 written comments were received, creating enough \ndata to identify trends and areas in need of support � The findings \nwere shared with management and enabled regional action points \nto be included in global and regional compliance programmes to \nhelp mitigate the risks identified � We will continue to carry out the \nsurvey annually, enabling us to track trends over time �\n67\nVestas Sustainability Report 2022\nGovernanceIn brief General Environment Sustainability dataSocial Appendix\nTraining and awareness\nTraining and communication activities are essential in fostering a \nculture of integrity globally, contributing to a common understand -\ning of what is expected from our employees � \nSince launching an updated Employee Code of Conduct in 2021, \nnew mandatory micro-learnings have been released every quarter to \nrefresh employees' knowledge on different topics in the Code � The \nmicro-learnings range from 5- 12 minutes each, and include several \ninteractive exercises inspired by past anonymised Vestas whistle -\nblower cases �\nWe also provided several training sessions focused on different \ntopics including Labour Rights and Modern Slavery, Conflicts of \nInterest, Gifts & Hospitality, and more, targeted to different \nfunctions and regions �\nSpeak Up campaign\nIn 2022, we began a global compliance campaign to promote our \nfour principles for speaking up about compliance at Vestas: Hard \ndecisions, Transparency, Integrity, and Consequences � To reach the \nwhole organisation, the campaign included an interactive competi -\ntion, intranet articles, info screens, and other regionalised initiatives \nat different Vestas locations � The campaign was promoted by senior \nleadership in town halls and team meetings and will continue \nthroughout 2023 � \nWorking ethically with suppliers\nAll Vestas suppliers are required to comply with our Supplier Code  \nof Conduct � The Supplier Code is an integrated part of our purchase \nagreements, and if a supplier is not following the Code, we will take \nthe necessary actions to mitigate risk and resolve any issues � \nIn some cases, this includes triggering the Supplier Blocking Process \nto terminate our relationship with the supplier � Some of the other \ntriggers for the Supplier Blocking Process include, but are not limited \nto, EthicsLine cases\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000,
