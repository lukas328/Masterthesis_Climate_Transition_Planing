For each risk, \nwe have estimated a financial effect, which considers the impact and likelihood of the risk. \nGiven the wide range of risks we face, we have then applied an overall probability weighting \nof 20% which allows us to work out the potential financial impact. We have also included \nimpacts of carbon pricing and a one-month temporary shutdown of a key site due to an \nextreme weather event.\nConclusion\nIn evaluating our viability under each of these scenarios, we considered our current financing \narrangements, see page 150, and assumed we would not refinance any maturing debt – \nalthough, in reality, we would expect to refinance our debts well ahead of maturity thereby \nincreasing headroom. Our stress testing shows that, under each of the scenarios described \nabove, we have ample headroom under our committed facilities and financial covenants. \nAs a final review, given the climate of greater political and economic certainty, we have also \nundertaken a reverse stress test to identify what additional or alternative scenarios and \ncircumstances would threaten our financial covenants or headroom. This shows that we have \nheadroom against either a further decline in profitability of more than 40% in the financial \nyear to March 2024, well beyond the severe-but-plausible scenario, or a significant increase \nin borrowings (net debt would need to more than double in the financial year to March \n2024).  In this unlikely scenario, we still have other mitigating actions available, including \nreducing capital expenditure, renegotiating payment terms or reducing our dividend. Based \non this assessment, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the company and group \nwill be able to continue operating, and meet its liabilities as they fall due, making it \nappropriate to prepare the accounts on a going concern basis.\nGoing concern and viability\nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 202370\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION\nNon-financial and sustainability information statement\nThe table below outlines how we meet the non-financial reporting requirements set out in the Companies Act 2006.
