The United Nations Environment Program Finance Initiative \n(UNEP FI) was established in April 2021, and Mizuho Financial Group joined the initiative in October 2021.

NZBA member banks \ntake the following actions. \n \n \nCEO message\nOverview/Introduction\nGovernance\nStrategy\nRisk management\nMetrics and targets\nConclusion\nAppendix\nCommitment by members of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (outline) \nMain actions of Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) \nmembers \n• Transition the GHG emissions from their lending \nand investment portfolios to align with pathways to \nnet-zero by 2050 or sooner. \n• Within 18 months of joining, set 2030 targets (or \nsooner) and a 2050 target. Periodically review all \ntargets, taking into account the best available \nscientific knowledge (including the findings of the \nIPCC). \n• Within 36 months of joining, banks will set targets \nfor all or most of the GHG-intensive industries \nbelow: \nAgriculture, aluminum, cement, coal, oil and gas, \ncommercial and residential real estate, iron  \nand steel, power generation, transport. \n• Annually publish absolute emissions and emissions \nintensity. \nThe NZBA commitment is designed to ensure that \nbanks engage with their clients’ transition and \ndecarbonization, promoting real economy transition. \nBanks will therefore undertake to do the following:  \n• Facilitating the necessary transition in the real \neconomy, through prioritizing client engagement and \noffering products and services to support clients’ \ntransition.  \n• Engaging on corporate and industry (financial and real \neconomy) action, as well as public policies, to help \nsupport a net-zero transition of economic sectors in \nline with science and giving consideration to \nassociated social impacts. \n• Supporting innovation, the near-term deployment of \nexisting viable technologies, and scaling up the \nfinancing of credible, safe, and high-quality climate \nsolutions that are compatible with other Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals.  \n \n-28- Mizuho Financial Group \n \n  \nThrough joining the NZBA, we have clarified our commitment to aim for net-zero GHG emissions from our financing and \ninvestment by 2050. We set our first sector-specific target in May 2022: our mid-term FY2030 target for the electric power \nsector. We will continue to set medium- to long-term science-based targets, formulate action plans, and advance \ndisclosures on our progress. \n \nIn order to support our clients’ transitions and decarbonization, we will continually support innovation and provide solutions \nincluding transition finance, with client engagement as our starting point. \n \n(2) Participation in the NZAM \nThe Net Zero Asset Managers initiative (NZAM) is an initiative launched by an international group of asset managers in \nDecember 2020. The NZAM’s Steering Committee is formed from six investor networks, including the Asia Investor Group \non Climate Change (AIGCC). The Steering Committee is responsible for the coordination of the initiative, and an Advisory \nGroup of six asset manager signatories informs the Steering Committee in its management of the initiative. As of \nDecember 31, 2021, NZAM has 236 signatories, with approximately USD 57.5 trillion in assets under management (AUM). \n \nThe main commitments of the NZAM are listed below. \n Commit to support the go al of net zero greenhouse gas (GHG ) emissions by 2050, in line with global efforts to \nlimit warming to 1.5°C (‘net zero emissions by 2050 or sooner’). \nCommit to support investing aligned with net zero emissions by 2050 or sooner. \n Work in partnership with asset owner clients on decarbonisation goals, consistent with an ambition to reach net \nzero emissions by 2050 or sooner across all assets under management (AUM) \n Set an interim target for the proportion of assets to be managed in line with the attainment of net zero emissions \nby 2050 or sooner. \n Review the interim target at least every five years, with a view to ratcheting up the\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
