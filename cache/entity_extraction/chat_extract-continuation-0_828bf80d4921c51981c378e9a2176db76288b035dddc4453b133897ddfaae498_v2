Depreciation \non other items of property, plant and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate cost or \nrevalued amount less residual value over estimated useful lives, as follows: \n▪ Freehold property 50 years \n▪ Right-of-use property Lease term \n▪ Leasehold improvements Shorter of useful life or lease term \n▪ Owned equipment 3-10 years \n▪ Right-of-use equipment Lease term \nImpairment \nImpairment reviews are undertaken where there are indications that the carrying value of an asset may not be \nrecoverable. An impairment loss on an asset carried at cost is recognised in other income and charges (see Note \n2.4) to reduce the carrying value to the recoverable amount. An impairment loss on an asset carried at revalued \namount is recognised in the property revaluation reserve, except where an asset is revalued below historical cost, \nin which case the loss on historical cost is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement within other income \nand charges. \nFor information regarding leased (right-of-use) assets, see Note 18. \nBupa Annual Report 2022
