We have also been a front-runner in developing the fields of sustainable \nfinance, in which we are aiming to provide a total of Â¥25 trillion by 2030, and transition finance, which has \n1. Message from the Group CEO \n\n  \nTCFD Report 2022  -5- \n \nbeen garnering greater attention. Another part of our role in promoting an orderly transition has been to act as \na catalyst, cooperating with all stakeholders across the public and private sectors to tackle a range of issues. \n \nTo demonstrate our strong dedication to such a transition, we have brought forward our target for our groupâs \ngreenhouse gas emissions by 20 years, committing to becoming carbon neutral by FY2030. Further, in Scope \n3 emissions, which are the most critical for financial institutions, we have set an FY2030 target for the electric \npower sector as a mid-term target towards achieving net zero by 2050. Our clientsâ transition progress will be \nthe driver to achieve this target, and we will work together with our clients towards the shared goal of \nachieving a low-carbon society and sustainable development. \n \nMizuho has made creating lasting value for our customers and the economies and communities in which we \noperate a part of our Corporate Philosophy.
