We have also been a front-runner in developing the fields of sustainable \nfinance, in which we are aiming to provide a total of ¥25 trillion by 2030, and transition finance, which has \n1. Message from the Group CEO \n\n  \nTCFD Report 2022  -5- \n \nbeen garnering greater attention. Another part of our role in promoting an orderly transition has been to act as \na catalyst, cooperating with all stakeholders across the public and private sectors to tackle a range of issues. \n \nTo demonstrate our strong dedication to such a transition, we have brought forward our target for our group’s \ngreenhouse gas emissions by 20 years, committing to becoming carbon neutral by FY2030. Further, in Scope \n3 emissions, which are the most critical for financial institutions, we have set an FY2030 target for the electric \npower sector as a mid-term target towards achieving net zero by 2050. Our clients’ transition progress will be \nthe driver to achieve this target, and we will work together with our clients towards the shared goal of \nachieving a low-carbon society and sustainable development. \n \nMizuho has made creating lasting value for our customers and the economies and communities in which we \noperate a part of our Corporate Philosophy.

Most recent key areas of progress \nAt Mizuho, based on our awareness that climate change is one of the most crucial global issues having the potential to impact the \nstability of financial markets, we have positioned addressing climate change as a key part of our corporate strategy and are \nstrengthening our initiatives. \n \nOur progress regarding the FY2021 action plan is as follows. \nThematic \nareas FY2021 action plan Key progress Pages \nGovernance • Report on the status of \nresponses to TCFD \nRecommendations to the \nBoard of Directors on an \nannual basis. \n• Gradually develop a pathway \ntowards our long-term goal of \nbeing aligned with the targets \nin the Paris Agreement. \n• Ensured regular reporting and discussion across the business \nexecution and supervisory lines, including the Sustainability \nPromotion Committee (newly established), Executive \nManagement Committee, Risk Committee, and Board of \nDirectors. Adjusted and clarified the group’s climate change \nresponse stance. \n• Revised Scope 1 and 2 targets and set new Scope 3 target (for \nthe electric power sector) in light of our participation in \ninternational initiatives (such as the Net Zero Banking Alliance \n(NZBA) and Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials \n(PCAF)) and our new policies (Mizuho’s Approach to Achieving \nNet Zero by 2050 and the Net Zero Transition Plan). \n14 – 19 \n \n \n \n \n \n12 – 13, \n21 – 26 \nStrategy • Implement initiatives reflecting \nclimate-related risks and \nopportunities. \n• Look into methods for \nassessing the impacts climate-\nrelated matters will have on our \nstrategy and finances. \n• Expand the sectors and \nregions under consideration in \nour scenario analysis and \nincorporate the analysis results \ninto our strategy and risk \nmanagement. \n• Updated risks and opportunities. Focused on support for clients’ \ndecarbonization and climate change countermeasures, with \nengagement as a starting point. \n• Continued to consider the cross-industry metrics and financial \nimpacts stated in the revised TCFD guidance. Quantified \nopportunities (market scale) and also calculated amount of \nimpacts on credit costs using scenario analysis. \n• Enhanced scenario analysis: For transition risk, analyzed with \n1.5°C scenario and added steel sector. For physical risk, \nreevaluated acute risks. \n37 – 38, \n31 – 34 \n \n29 – 30, \n39 – 47 \n \n \n39 – 47 \nRisk \nmanagement \n• Review framework for \nidentifying and assessing risk, \nenhance monitoring, and \ncontinuously review financing \nand investment policy. \n• Improve effectiveness of \nengagement based on \ncoordination between the first \nand second lines of defense by \nutilizing a risk assessment and \ncontrol framework for carbon-\nrelated credit exposure. \n• Enhanced climate-related risk management. \n- Increasing severity of climate change impacts designated as \na top risk. Changes in the external business environment and \nstatus of control on carbon-related credit exposure now \npresented to executive management on a quarterly basis. \n- Strengthened risk control in carbon-related sectors: Added \nsteel and cement to targeted sectors, strengthened response \nin the case of client engagement being ineffective. \n- Revised Environmental and Social Management Policy for \nFinancing and Investment Activity: Strengthened policies on \ntransition risk sectors, the coal-fired power generation and \nthermal coal mining sectors, and others. \n• Expanded engagement (approx. 2,300 companies in total) and \nclarified frequency and standards for confirming transition risk \nresponse. \n \n49 \n \n \n \n \n50 – 54 \n  \n \n55 – 57 \n \n  \n \n31 – 34 \nMetrics and \ntargets \n• Look into expanding disclosure \non our responses to transition\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MIZUHO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Mizuho Financial Group is a major financial institution actively advancing initiatives related to sustainable finance, transition finance, and climate change mitigation, including setting targets for carbon neutrality and supporting development of green and transition finance projects)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MASAHIRO KIHARA<|>PERSON<|>Masahiro Kihara is the President & Group CEO of Mizuho Financial Group, leading the company's efforts in addressing climate change and creating sustainable value for stakeholders)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JAPAN<|>GEO<|>Japan is the country where Mizuho Financial Group is headquartered and operates, with a focus on supporting domestic and international climate-related initiatives)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TCFD<|>EVENT<|>Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, an international initiative providing guidelines for climate-related financial reporting, which Mizuho reports on and aligns with in its strategy)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARIS AGREEMENT<|>EVENT<|>International climate accord aiming to limit global warming, which Mizuho aligns its long-term climate targets with)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NET ZERO BANKING ALLIANCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An international initiative that Mizuho participates in to commit to net-zero banking emissions by 2050)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARTNERSHIP FOR CARBON ACCOUNTING FINANCIALS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An initiative that supports Mizuho in measuring and managing its carbon footprint in financial activities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCOPE 1<|>EVENT<|>Direct greenhouse gas emissions from owned or controlled sources, with Mizuho revising its targets for these emissions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCOPE 2<|>EVENT<|>Indirect greenhouse gas emissions from the generation of purchased electricity, steam, heating, and cooling consumed by Mizuho)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCOPE 3<|>EVENT<|>Other indirect emissions in the value chain, including emissions from the electric power sector, targeted by Mizuho for reduction by FY2030)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS<|>EVENT<|>Environmental impact metrics that Mizuho aims to reduce, with a target to become carbon neutral by FY2030)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLIMATE CHANGE<|>EVENT<|>Global issue that significantly impacts financial markets and is a central focus of Mizuho's corporate strategy)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT<|>EVENT<|>Global goal supported by Mizuho through its initiatives to promote low-carbon society and social responsibility)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MIZUHO<|>TCFD<|>Mizuho reports on its climate-related responses following TCFD recommendations<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MIZUHO<|>PARIS AGREEMENT<|>Mizuho aligns its long-term climate targets with the Paris Agreement<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MIZUHO<|>NET ZERO BANKING ALLIANCE<|>Mizuho participates in the Net Zero Banking Alliance to commit to net-zero emissions<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MIZUHO<|>PARTNERSHIP FOR CARBON ACCOUNTING FINANCIALS<|>Mizuho supports this initiative to measure and manage its carbon footprint<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MIZUHO<|>SCOPE 3<|>Mizuho has set FY2030 targets for Scope 3 emissions in the electric power sector<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MIZUHO<|>GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS<|>Mizuho aims to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions and achieve carbon neutrality<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MIZUHO<|>CLIMATE CHANGE<|>Mizuho considers climate change a critical issue impacting its strategy and risk management<|>8)\n##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
