Annual Report and Accounts 2021 , February 2022.\nHSBC aims to support its customers on their net-zero transition and works with clients in different sectors on \ntheir sustainability and GHG emissions reduction goals. 99 This corresponds to the GFANZ recommendation to \ndevelop products and services that will accelerate and scale the net-zero transition in the real economy and \nsupport portfolio decarbonization. To do this, HSBC provides clients with a range of products and services aligned \nto the transition, while contributing to its own net-zero targets. Relatedly, these initiatives contribute to HSBC’s \nsustainable finance and investment 100 target of between $750 billion and $1 trillion by 2030. 101 In 2021, HSBC:\n• organized two large-scale, aviation sector sustainability-linked loans:\n – Etihad airline company raised $1.2 billion, with targets including emissions reduction for the passenger fleet, \nwith financial penalties and incentives of up to $5.5 million.\n – British Airways plc raised £1 billion linked to aircraft fuel efficiency.\n• attracted international and domestic investors when Greece-based Public Power Corporation issued a €650 \nmillion high-yield sustainability-linked bond, committing the company to reduce its carbon emissions, or face \nhigher financing costs;  \n• launched HSBC Pollination Climate Asset Management  to establish natural capital funds to address nature-\nrelated issues and climate change, for both emerging and developed markets ;102 \n• launched a £500 million Green SME Fund to support businesses in the transition to a low-carbon economy, \noutlining criteria for green activities across a range of sub-categories ;103 and\n• introduced green mortgages for customers in the UAE and Singapore to finance the purchase of homes \naccredited as energy efficient. 104\nIMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY\nCONTENTS  |  FINANCIAL INSTITUTION NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLANS — FUNDAMENTALS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND GUIDANCE\n43\n \nExample 5.

Moody’s views the delivery of new products and services, research and \ndevelopment, and innovation as crucial pillars of its net-zero strategy. The company describes its role in the race \nto net zero as bringing clarity to the complex and interrelated macroeconomic, financial, and social impacts of \nclimate change. 105 \nIt organizes its climate-related products and services into two broad offerings:\n1. New solutions to support customers in understanding portfolio alignment and climate risk\nIn 2021, Moody’s launched Climate Solutions,106 a product suite dedicated to the identification, quantification, \nmonitoring, and integration of climate risk into financial decision-making. For example, Temperature Alignment Data \nassesses how individual companies’ emissions targets align with global temperature benchmarks.107 This product \nallows users to assess the forward-looking trajectory of companies’ emissions based on GHG emissions reduction \ntargets.108 Using this information, banks and asset managers can monitor the net-zero alignment of their portfolios, \nbenchmarking their emissions targets against peer targets.\nOther products in the Climate Solutions product suite include CreditLens™, which aims to enable lenders to assess \nand integrate the impact of climate on a customer’s credit quality, as part of existing credit origination processes; \nand Supply Chain Catalyst, which aims to enable the assessment of climate risk throughout the supply chain.\n2. Embedding climate analysis into credit ratings\nIn 2021, Moody’s Investors Service (MIS) provided greater transparency into how ESG and climate considerations \nare integrated into its credit ratings by embedding ESG Issuer Profile Scores (including carbon transition scores) \nand Credit Impact Scores into credit ratings.109 MIS also provides detailed Carbon Transition Assessments for rated \ncompanies in sectors that are most exposed to these risks.110\nIMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY\nCONTENTS  |  FINANCIAL INSTITUTION NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLANS — FUNDAMENTALS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND GUIDANCE\n44\n \nExample 6.
