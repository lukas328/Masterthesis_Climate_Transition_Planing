So our customers can be confident \nwe can help them decarbonise successfully. For example, the H2H Saltend project in the UK will \nuse JM’s LCH™ technology in its 600MW low carbon hydrogen production plant with carbon \ncapture. This is just one of several leading-edge decarbonisation projects in Europe and North \nAmerica that show the value we bring to partnerships.\nOur performance in 2022/23\nLike the rest of the business, Catalyst Technologies continued to deal with economic \nheadwinds in 2022/23. Underlying operating profit of £51 million was in line with the prior \nyear. Margins declined to 9.1%; however we saw good improvement from the first to the \nsecond half of the year. Higher pricing, improved product mix and the benefits of our \ntransformation programme offset significant cost inflation and the loss of business in Russia.  \nDespite these challenges, sales during the period were up 17%, with strong growth in \nlicensing and growth in first fills and refills reflecting higher pricing and positive mix. We \ncontinued to deliver on our commercial and strategic goals. Our sharper commercial focus \nhas resulted in us winning 12 new licences. We are also making good progress towards CT \nand HT’s 2023/24 goal of winning more than ten additional large-scale projects, with five \nadded to our portfolio. Our continued investment in our business is exemplified by the \nformaldehyde catalyst capacity expansion in our facility in Perstorp, Sweden. This is \nprogressing well and is on track to be fully operational in early 2024/25, increasing the site’s \ncapacity by around 50%.\nWe will focus on further strengthening the value creation from our core catalyst businesses and \nleveraging our strong customer satisfaction scores. Internally, we will maintain the momentum \nwe created in 2022/23 around simplifying our operations, creating clearer accountability and \nsetting performance targets that deliver value today and growth for the future.\nOur R&D teams continue to innovate on the catalysts, reactors and process concepts that \ntogether enable technology leadership in low carbon (blue) hydrogen and sustainable \naviation fuels as well as ammonia cracking and other e-fuels. We are creating cost-effective \nsolutions with low carbon intensity tailored to the feedstocks of the future. We are also \ninvesting in sustainable catalyst manufacturing technologies across the portfolio. \nCatalyst Technologies continued\nPioneering the use of household waste \nas a feedstock with Fulcrum Sierra\nAlong with international energy company \nbp, we are enabling the world’s first \ncommercial-scale plant to use household \nrubbish as a feedstock for the production \nof synthetic crude oil. Using our FT CANS™ \ntechnology, the Fulcrum Sierra Biofuels \nPlant in Reno, Nevada, is expected to \nproduce around 11 million gallons of \nproduct annually from 175,000 tonnes \nof landfill waste that can be refined into \nrenewable, low carbon transportation fuel.\nJM and bp have worked with waste-to-\nfuels developer Fulcrum to use FT CANS \ntechnology since 2018. \nThis project lays important foundations \nfor the transition to a less carbon-intensive \neconomy. In order to reach its climate \ngoals of achieving net zero by 2050, \nthe aviation industry needs reliable and \nscalable sources of alternative fuels. Using \nwaste as feedstock will also help to reduce \nboth the amount of waste sent to landfill \nand the methane produced through \nbiodegradation.\nWatch: ready for take off: matthey.com/\nready-for-take-off\nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 2023 19\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION\nHydrogen Technologies \nProviding critical components for the  \nemerging hydrogen economy\nRenewable (green) hydrogen has the potential \nto transform energy systems. As a fuel, it creates \nno carbon emissions, and if the electricity used \nto produce it comes from renewable sources, the \nenvironmental benefits are tremendous. Global \ninvestment, innovation and demand for green \nhydrogen solutions is growing rapidly. To make \nthe hydrogen economy viable, businesses need two \nprocesses: a way to use renewable electricity to split water \ninto hydrogen and oxygen, and fuel cells to turn that \nhydrogen back into electricity when and where it is \nneeded. Our specialist catalyst coated membranes (CCMs) \nare essential to both of these processes. \nCustomer-led growth\nJohnson Matthey has been active in hydrogen in fuel cells for over 20 years, and our Hydrogen \nTechnologies business is playing to win in the hydrogen market. In order to fully capitalise on \nthis fast growth market, we need to be able to move quickly, scale effectively and efficiently \nmanage the risks inherent in doing so. As the market becomes increasingly crowded, being \nable to demonstrate the competitiveness of our offer and the scale of our capabilities will be \nhugely important.\nPartnerships and strategic relationships with customers are critical to our goal of becoming \na market leader. We aim to partner with the expected winners in the markets for fuel \ncells and electrolysis, and to do this we have put customer-led growth at the heart of our \ncommercial strategy. We look to partner with strategic customers early in their development \ncycle. These are partners that we believe have the capabilities to win\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
