Awards under the RSP are not subject to \nperformance targets. The shares are subject only to the condition that the employee remains employed by the group on the vesting date (three years after the award date). \nLTIP \nPrior to 2017, shares were awarded to approximately 1,300 of the group’s executive directors, senior managers and middle managers under the LTIP based on a percentage of salary and were \nsubject to performance targets over a three-year period. \nAwards to the executive directors are subject to a deferred release whereby a third is released on the third anniversary of the award date and the remaining vested shares are released in equal instalments \non the fourth and fifth anniversaries of the award date. The Remuneration Committee is entitled to claw back the awards to the executive directors in cases of misstatement or misconduct. \nAll outstanding awards on this scheme were released in August 2021. \nDeferred bonus \nA proportion of the bonus payable to executive directors and senior managers is awarded as shares and deferred for three years. The Remuneration Committee is entitled to claw back the deferred \nelement in cases of misstatement or misconduct or other relevant reason as determined by it. \n \nNotes on the Accounts continued for the year ended 31st March 2023 \n \n205 \n30 Share-based payments continued \nAll employee share incentive plan (SIP) – UK and overseas \nUnder the SIP, all employees with at least one year of service with the group and who are employed by a participating group company are entitled to contribute up to 2.5% of base pay each month, \nsubject to a £125 per month limit. The SIP trustees buy shares (partnership shares) at market value each month with the employees’ contributions. For each partnership share purchased, the group \npurchases two shares (matching shares) which are awarded to the employee. \nIn the UK SIP, if the employee sells or transfers partnership shares within three years of the date of award, the linked matching shares are forfeited. \nIn the overseas SIP, partnership shares and matching shares are subject to a three-year holding period and cannot be sold or transferred during that time. \nDuring the year, 311,260 (2022: 287,320) matching shares under the SIP were awarded to employees. These are nil cost awards on which performance conditions are substantially completed at \nthe date of grant and, consequently, the fair value of these awards is based on the market value of the shares at that date.
