Our networks are created by our people \nand supported by the business. These are bottom-up initiatives, not top \ndown. They are focused on building communities, raising awareness and \nadvocating for change.\nNinety One Inspire\nInspire is a network created \nby women for women at \nNinety One. It enables the \nexchange of knowledge and \nexperiences in order to improve \nthe opportunities for women \nat Ninety One and advocate \nfor continued progress. Over \nthe past year, we have hosted \nvarious inspirational female \nspeakers from across the \nfinancial industry and beyond, \nincluding international best-\nselling authors and global \nsustainability leaders. We also \nheld internal workshops to \nempower our colleagues on \nvarious topics.\nNinety One Proud\nProud is Ninety One’s LGBT+ \nnetwork. It is designed to \ncreate an internal community \nfor our LGBT+ colleagues \nand their allies. Proud is \nfocused on developing and \npromoting an inclusive work \nenvironment, where people \nwho identify as LGBT+ are \nfree to be themselves, and \nattracting and retaining the \nbest talent regardless of their \nsexual orientation or gender \nidentity. We hold an annual \nProud Voices campaign that \ncelebrates our colleagues \nwho identify as LGBT+ and \ntheir allies.\nNinety One Belong\nBelong is our network \nfocused on the recruitment, \nretention and representation \nof black talent. Belong \nis focused on achieving \nthis through enhancing \nNinety One’s recruitment \nstrategy, improving \nretention by partnering with \ninternal stakeholders, and \nenhancing representation \nthrough education and \ncultural exchange.\nSustainability and Stewardship Report\n67\nPhilosophy of success \nFreedom to create\nOne of the main tenets of, and the philosophy behind, our culture, is \nthe concept of freedom to create. We steadfastly believe in giving \nindividuals the freedom to be themselves. We are creating a culture \nwhere we can collectively achieve together, without sacrificing our \nindividuality. We believe that people perform best when they are \nliberated to pursue their passions and interests and we strive to give \npeople the freedom to give expression to their strengths, skills and \ntalents. Freedom is the greatest driver of diversity in our business.\nMetrics of success \nResults and relationships\nIf freedom to create sits at the core of our culture, valuing strong \nrelationships encircles that core. Strong relationships breed diversity \nin our business and an environment where all people feel welcome \nand respected, and know they have a fair opportunity to develop and \ncontribute. We expect people to perform both on the results they \ndeliver and the quality of their relationships. These are important \nmeasures of our culture.\nSustainability and Stewardship Report\nRunning our business \nresponsibly and reducing \nenergy consumption in \nour properties \nWe recognise our responsibility to play our part in reducing global emissions, \nand we support the long-term goal of the Paris Agreement to keep the global \naverage temperature increase to below 1.5°C. We use an environmental data-\ncollection system to track and manage our direct operational impacts. Over \nthe year, we further improved the accuracy and thoroughness of our data, \nbased on updated carbon emission factors, improvements in data quality and \nadjustments to previous estimates.\nFY2024 FY2023  2019\nLocation based Market based Location based Market based (global \nbaseline)\nUK Global UK Global UK Global UK Global\nScope 1 (fuel) 7 60 7 60 4 20 4 20 227\nScope 2 (electricity) 311 2,752 6 2,447 330 2,722 4 2,396 3,546\nTotal Scope 1 & 2 318 2,812 13 2,507 334 2,742 8 2,416 3,773\nBusiness travel 2,015 6,670 2,015 6,670 1,745 4,604 1,745 4,604 7,957\nWaste generated \nin operations\n13 24 13 24 12 22 12 22 53\nScope 3 2,028 6,694 2,028 6,694 1,757 4,625 1,757 4,625 8,010\nTotal CO2e emissions 2,346 9,505 2,041 9,200 2,091 7,367 1,766 7,042 11,783\nEnergy consumption \n(kWh)20\n4,347,584 4,541,788\nTotal CO2e/employee  8.0  7.8  6.1  5.8 \nScope 1 & 2/employee  2.4  2.1  2.3  2.0 \nTonnes CO2e/£m of \nadjusted operating \nrevenue\n 16.0  15.4  11.6  11.1 \nScope 1 & 2 – tonnes \np/£m of adjusted \noperating revenue\n 4.7  4\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
