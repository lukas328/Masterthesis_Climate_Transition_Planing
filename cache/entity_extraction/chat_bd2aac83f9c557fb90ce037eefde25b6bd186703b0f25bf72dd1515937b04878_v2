The \nconsolidated accounts of the company for the year ended 31st March 2023 consist of the \naudited consolidation of the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred \nto as the ‘Group’), together with the employee share ownership trust and the group's interest \nin joint ventures and associates. \nBasis of accounting and preparation – group \nThe financial statements of the group have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted \nInternational Accounting Standards and with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 as \napplicable to companies reporting under those standards. \nThe accounts are prepared on the historical cost basis, except for certain assets and liabilities \nwhich are measured at fair value as explained below. \nThe group accounts comprise the accounts of the parent company and its subsidiaries, \nincluding the employee share ownership trust, and include the group's interest in joint \nventures and associates. Entities the group controls are accounted for as subsidiaries. Entities \nthat are joint ventures or associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. \nTransactions and balances between group companies are eliminated. No profit is recognised \non transactions between group companies. \nThe results of businesses acquired or disposed of in the year are consolidated from or up to the \neffective date of acquisition or disposal, respectively. The net assets of businesses acquired are \nrecognised in the consolidated accounts at their fair values at the date of acquisition. \nGoing concern \nThe directors have reviewed a range of scenario forecasts for the group and have reasonable \nexpectation that there are no material uncertainties that cast doubt about the group’s ability to \ncontinue operating for at least twelve months from the date of approving these annual accounts. \nAs at 31st March 2023, the group maintains a strong balance sheet with around £1.6 billion \nof available cash and undrawn committed facilities. Free cash flow was positive in the year \nat £74 million. Net debt at 31st March 2023 was £1,023 million at 1.6 times net debt \n(including post tax pension deficits) to underlying EBITDA which was at the lower end of \nour target range. \nAlthough impacted by the significant headwinds faced in the current macroeconomic \nenvironment such as high inflation, the impacts of Russia’s war with Ukraine and uncertainty \nin outlook for major economies, the group’s performance during the period was resilient, both \nin terms of underlying operating profit and cash flow. For the purposes of assessing going \nconcern, we have revisited our financial projections using the latest forecasts for our base case \nscenario. The base case scenario was stress tested to a severe-but-plausible downside case \nwhich reflects severe recession scenarios. \nThe severe-but-plausible case for Clean Air modelled scenarios assuming a smaller light duty \nvehicle market from reduced vehicle production and/or market consumer demand disruption \nor greater share of zero emission vehicles in market, assumed to result in a 10% drop in sales. \nFor PGMS and Catalyst Technologies, it also assumed a reduction in sales and associated \noperating profit based on adverse scenarios using external and internal market insights. \nAdditionally, as part of viability testing, the group considered scenarios including the impact \nfrom metal price volatility, higher inflation, delays in capital projects and delivery of cost \ntransformation savings, and slow down of operations in China. Whilst the combined impact \nwould reduce profitability and EBITDA against our latest forecast, our balance sheet remains \nstrong with ample working capital and Net Debt/EBITDA ratios. \nThe group has\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
