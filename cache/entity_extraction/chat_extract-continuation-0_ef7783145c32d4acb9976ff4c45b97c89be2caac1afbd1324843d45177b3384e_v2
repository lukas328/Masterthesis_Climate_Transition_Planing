As both the operator of the \nUK’s primary stock exchange and as a UK-listed \nbusiness, LSEG intends to play a pivotal role \nin shaping and promoting the adoption of best \npractice Climate Transition Plans to deliver this.\nThe SBTi Net Zero Standard states:\nTo contribute to societal net zero goals, companies must deeply reduce \nemissions and counterbalance the impact of any emissions that remain. \nThe SBTi Net Zero Standard defines corporate net zero as: \n – Reducing scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions to zero or to a residual level that \nis consistent with reaching net zero emissions at the global or sector \nlevel in eligible 1.5°C-aligned pathways. \n – Neutralising any residual emissions in the net zero target year  \nand any greenhouse gas emissions released into the  \natmosphere thereafter.\nLSEG CLIMATE TRANSITION PLAN 20228\nCONTENTS\nDefining net zero \nNet zero means that any greenhouse gas emissions \nproduced and emitted into the atmosphere are  \nremoved equally. \nLSEG has adopted the Science Based Target Initiative (SBTi) Net Zero \nStandard released in October 2021, which defines net zero and is the first \nglobal science-based standard for companies to set validated near-term and \nlong-term science-based targets consistent with limiting temperature rise to \n1.5°C, driving forward the global transition to net zero.\nThe Net Zero Standard sets out four key elements that make up a corporate \nnet zero target. The first of these is a near-term science-based target, the \nsecond is a long-term science-based target, and the third is mitigation beyond \nthe value chain. The final element is neutralisation of any residual emissions.\nThe Net Zero Standard states that in the long term, emissions in the  \ncross-sector pathway1 are reduced by at least 90% and most sector-specific \npathways also reduce CO2 emissions by 90% or more from 2020 levels. \nConsequently, for many companies, long-term science-based targets will be \nequivalent to at least a 90% absolute reduction across scopes regardless of \nwhether the cross-sector pathway or sector-specific pathways are used.\n1The SBTi offers a cross-sector pathway and sector-specific pathways for setting science-based targets. Companies in the \npower generation sector and forestry, land-use, and agriculture (FLAG) sectors are required to set SBTs using sector-\nspecific pathways (effective for FLAG sectors after the finalization of SBTi and GHG Protocol guidance).  \nFor all other companies, the cross-sector pathway is eligible and recommended for setting absolute targets\nB y 2050 a t the la t e st\n5 t o 10 y ear s\n1.5° C-aligne d emissions pa th wa y \n  \nEmissions (tCO 2e)\n4\n4\n3\n3\n1\n1\n2\n2\nAba t emen t within the v alue chain \nR emo v als\nAba t emen t or r emo v als b e y ond \na c ompan y ’s v alue chain\nNe t z er o emissions\nTo set near-term SBTs: 5-10 year emission reduction targets in line with 1.5 0 C pathways.\nTo set long-term SBTs: target to reduce emissions to a residual level in line with 1.5 0 C \nscenarios by no later than 2050.\nBeyond value chain mitigation: in the transition to net zero, companies should take action to \nmitigate emissions beyond their value chains. For example, purchasing high-quality, \njurisdictional REDD+ credits or investing in direct air capture (DAC) and geologic storage.\nNeutralisation of residual emissions: GHGs released into the atmosphere when the \ncompany has achieved their long-term SBT must be counterbalanced through the \npermanent removal and storage of carbon from the atmosphere.\nLSEG CLIMATE TRANSITION PLAN

companies had adopted \nnear-term science-based emissions \ntargets validated by the SBTi.\nDuring 2021 we created a combined emissions \ndata inventory, integrating data from both \nbusinesses, aligning methodologies and creating \na 2019 baseline from which our future targets \nwould be set.\nThroughout 2021, as well as establishing a \nrevised data inventory, we set a new \nscience-based target for the combined  \nGroup, which was approved by the SBTi in  \nDecember 2021. \nWe also updated our policies, governance \nand created new ways of working, setting \nemissions-reduction glidepath plans to help us \nachieve our ambition for the enlarged Group.\nWe also play a pivotal role in financial markets, \nenabling an economy-wide transition to  \nnet zero. \nWe are using our unique market position, \ncapabilities, products and services to support  \na global reallocation of capital which shares  \nthe costs and benefits of reaching net zero  \nfairly between and within countries.\nFurther details on our 2021 progress can  \nbe found in our Sustainability Report and  \nTaskforce on Climate-related Financial \nDisclosures (TCFD) Report.\nEmissions are categorised into
