\ncustomers, shareholders, and employees.”\n2022 marks a year of incredible recognition as our sustainability \nratings and rankings continued to improve � Our Circularity Roadmap \nreceived the highest prize from our industry association in Denmark � \nWe were added to the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index and \nawarded an A score in climate by CDP � In January 2023, we were \nranked the most sustainable energy company, and the second most \nsustainable company in the world, by Corporate Knights' Global 100 �\nBut our sustainability journey is far from complete � A wave of \nlegislation, tender requirements, and investor enquiries necessitate \nthat we continually update our sustainability disclosures in line with \nevolving stakeholder expectations � Some of these shifts are fairly \ntechnical, such as national recycling targets or individual customer \nspecifications, but others are more transformative to our company \nand industry � \nTo maintain our position as a leader in sustainability, we must ensure \nour business activities are aligned with science-based physical \nboundaries � Our first experience with this way of thinking was \naccomplished when we received validation by the Science-based \nTargets initiative (SBTi) that our net-zero trajectory was in-line with a \n1�5 degree warming scenario � This year, we have concretely \nsegregated and
