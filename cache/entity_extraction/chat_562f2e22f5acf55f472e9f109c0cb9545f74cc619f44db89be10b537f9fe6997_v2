T o determine the funds channeled \nto sustainable business, internal criteria is \nused based on both internal and external \ninformation, either from public sources, \nprovided by customers or by a third party \n(mainly data providers and independent \nexperts) 20.\n20. BBVA does not assume any responsibility for the opinions expressed \nby third parties or for any errors or omissions in the information coming \nfrom external sources.\nThe aforementioned sustainable business \npipeline is a metric that may differ from \nother metrics of a regulatory nature. In \nparticular, this metric differs from the \namount of exposure to sustainable business \ndisclosed under the technical standards \nof execution (ITS) on the information of \nPillar 3 related to environmental, social and \ngovernance (ESG) risks21, whose objective is \nthe measurement of exposure to mitigation \nand adaptation actions22 against climate \nchange. The reasons for these differences \ncome from the different calculation criteria \nused in both concepts, highlighting the \nfollowing: \nI  \nWhile channeling includes mobilization of \nfinancial flows that may not be recorded on \nthe balance sheet (e.g. transactional banking \nactivity, investment funds, investment or \nbonds in which BBVA acts as bookrunner, \netc), the regulatory metric only includes \nexposures within the balance sheet assets;.\n21. Included in the Implementing Regulation (EU) 2022/2453 of the \nCommission of 30 November 2022, amending the implementing \ntechnical standards laid down in the Implementing Regulation (EU) \n2021/637 .\n22. According to the regulatory definition (FINREP) of exposure: \noutstanding risk of loans and advances, as well as bonds in the \ninvestment portfolio.\nII  \nWhile the concept of channeling is \ncumulative (reflects accumulated balances \nsince 2018), the regulatory metric only \nincludes exposure for the year in question;\n \nIII  \nWhile the channeling reflects the total \nmobilization of flows, the regulatory metric \nonly includes outstanding balances on the \nbalance sheet in the\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
