Financial \ninstitutions should support clients’ climate change countermeasures and the transition to a low-carbon society. This support \nshould be grounded in an understanding that the transition process will differ by location and industry type. In order for us  \nto fulfil our role as a financial institution, Mizuho conducts engagement with clients and requests that they share their \ntransition strategies. Through this client engagement, we confirm the status of our clients’ transition strategies and provide \nclients with support that facilitates the execution of said strategies. If a client shows no progress towards strategy execution \ndespite multiple efforts to engage them to do so, we carefully consider whether or not to continue our business with them. \n \nThe road to net zero will vary by business location and industry type. Strong national leadership with effective policies and \nthe establishment of next-generation technology are essential in speeding up the transition towards net-zero emissions. At \npresent, there is a gap between, on the one hand, current commitments, government policy, and technology, and on the \nother hand, the road to limiting the global temperature increase to 1.5°C. At Mizuho, we believe we must work together with \nstakeholders to bridge this gap. Mizuho supports government policy aimed at an orderly transition in the jurisdictions where \nwe operate. We do this through our business activities across regions and economies, industry groups, and initiatives. We \nalso proactively support the development and application of innovative, clean, next-generation technology. \n \nFurther, Mizuho is continually enhancing our climate risk management for the purpose of stabilizing financial markets. In \nthese ways, we are contributing to the achievement of a low -carbon society and the development of a climate change -\nresilient society by 2050. \n \nTable 2: Net Zero Transition Plan (Formulated in April 2022) \nNet-zero \nGHG \nemissions \n Scope 1 & 2: Mizuho group GHG emissions to be carbon neutral by FY2030. \n Scope 3: GHG emissions resulting from our financing and investment. \n- Begin process of setting mid-term targets (to be reached by FY2030) in order to achieve net zero by \nFY2050. \n- Enhance measurement and disclosure of financed emissions. \nStrengthen \nlow-carbon \nbusiness \n Strengthen our support for the transition to a low-carbon society by engaging with clients and providing \nfinancial and non-financial solutions. \n- Implement sustainable finance (total of ¥25 trillion by FY2030). \n- Improve our ability to provide value chain / entire supply chain solutions. \n- Support innovation that contributes to decarbonization. \nEnhance \nclimate-\nrelated risk \nmanagement \n Continually enhance risk management frameworks and policies that aim to create a business base \nresilient to climate change-related developments. \n- Continually review our carbon-related sector risk exposure control policy and our Environmental and \nSocial Management Policy for Financing and Investment Activity, and make efforts toward risk \nquantification. \nStrengthen \nour stance \n Strengthen our stance on achieving net zero. \n Participate in international initiatives and strengthen coordination with diverse stakeholders. \n  \n  \nTCFD Report 2022  -23- \n \n2. Achieving net zero \n(1) Approach to Scope 3 targets (electric power) and strategy for achieving targets \nWe have a long-term goal of achieving net-zero GHG emissions from financing and investment by 2050. To make the pathway to \nreaching this goal more tangible, we are pressing forward with setting sector-specific mid-term targets (to be reached by FY2030), \nstarting with priority sectors. \n \nMizuho’s first mid -term targets were set for the electric power sector. These targets were formulated based on the NZBA ’s \nGuidelines for Climate Target Setting for Banks, discussed at Mizuho Financial Group’s Executive Management Committee, and \napproved by the Board of Directors. \n \nMetric GHG emission intensity (kgCO2/MWh) (GHG emissions per unit of power generated) \n \nTargeted \nemissions \nGHG emissions (Scope 1) from power generation projects belonging electric power sector \ncorporations and ventures \nTargeted power \ngeneration Actual annual power generation from power sector corporations and ventures \nTargeted assets Loans (Total across corporate finance and project finance)9 \nMetric formula \n \nTarget year Base year: FY2020  Target year: FY2030  \nBase year results FY2020 emission intensity of 388 kgCO2/MWh \nBenchmark \nscenarios \n1.
