EPC data is available for mortgages \namounting to £138.8 billion as at 31 December 2022 (31 December 2021 £116.2 billion). This accounts for 68% of \nthe UK mortgage portfolio (31 December 2021 – 62%). Of these, £123.4 billion are owner occupied and £15.4 billion \nare buy-to-let. \nSupporting our UK mortgage customers to increase their residential energy efficiency and incentivising purchase of the \nmost energy efficient homes is a key part of our climate ambition. In addition, we have an ambition that 50%(3) of our \nUK mortgage portfolio has an EPC rating of C or above by 2030. In February 2023, we announced that we will aim to \nprovide an additional £10 billion for EPC A and B residential properties between January 2023 and the end 2025 as \npart of our climate and sustainable funding and financing target. As at 31 December 2022, 41.5%(*) (31 December 2021 \n38.3%) of our UK residential mortgages portfolio that had EPC data available, was at EPC C or better.\nData source and limitations: For properties in England and Wales EPC data has been sourced from the Energy \nPerformance of Buildings for England and Wales published by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local \nGovernment’s open data source. The data is drawn from EPCs issued for domestic and non-domestic buildings \nconstructed, sold or let since 2008. It provides information on the energy efficiency ratings of domestic and \nnon-domestic buildings during the energy assessment process.
