These \ntargets cover a range of different \nscopes, timelines and pathways  \nand are often not underpinned by \ncurrent climate science.  \nRecognising the need for a consistent \nand objective approach to net-zero \ntargets, the SBTi began developing \na new framework in 2021 to \nprovide business leaders with a \ncommon, robust, and science-based \nunderstanding of what net-zero means \nin practice. After inviting experts - \nincluding JLL - to form the SBTi Net-\nZero Expert Advisory Group, the SBTi \nformulated the Net-Zero Standard.  \nThe Net-Zero Standard brings the \nlatest climate science to net-zero target \nsetting. It is the first global science-\nbased standard to guide organisations \nsetting net-zero targets and encourage \nthem to follow the principles of the \nmitigation hierarchy. Effectively this \nmeans that companies should set \nscience-based targets to reduce their \nvalue chain emissions and implement \nstrategies to achieve these targets \nbefore engaging in neutralisation. \n \nThe SBTi defines beyond value chain \nmitigation as action or investments that \nfall outside of a company’s value chain. \nThis includes activities that avoid or \nreduce greenhouse gas emissions, and \nthose that remove and store greenhouse \ngases from the atmosphere.\nNet-Zero Standard,  \nexplained\nAbout  \nJLL\nExecutive \nremarks\nOur progress to  \nnet-zero world\nOur journey  \nto net-zero\nLearn  \nmore\nOur headline  \nactions\n\n8 | Transition to net-zero\nOur Journey to net-zero \n \nJLL is committed to reducing our emissions and doing \nour part to achieve the 1.5°C target needed to avert the \nworst outcomes of global warming.\n \nThe built environment is estimated to account for close  \nto 40% of energy-related carbon emissions, meaning  \nJLL can have a significant impact through the work we  \ndo with our clients and our people as well as in our \nworkplaces and communities.  \nWe recognize that the systemic nature of global warming \nrequires that change be introduced across all levels of \nour organization.
