We also use the PCAF emissions factor database when needed to fill data gaps. \nPCAF has established a data quality hierarchy that allows Citi to score emissions estimates for all clients. \nData scores range from 1 to 5, with a score of 1 signifying disclosed and third party verified emissions — \nthe highest quality data — and a score of 5 signifying the greatest level of estimation based on sectoral \neconomic activity emissions factors — the lowest quality data. Without client specific data, the sector-\nlevel estimations can result in inaccurate estimations of client emissions. We are continually working to \nimprove the data that we use, which will in turn refine the calculation results that we report in our annual \ndisclosures. Please see the “Metrics & Targets” section of this report for further details of our PCAF data \nquality score for each of our sectors. \nScenario Benchmarking \nTo better inform our decarbonization pathways and support the development of interim targets, we \nevaluate and use a variety of scenarios. Our NZBA commitment indicates that we use the UNEP FI \nGuidelines as the framework for aligning our portfolios with pathways to net zero by 2050. However , the \nUNEP FI Guidelines do not specify the scenarios to be used in target setting. For most sectors, Citi has used \nthe industry-specific scenarios issued by the International Energy Agency (IEA) in its annual World Energy \nOutlook and interim special reports — notably, the IEA Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS) and Net-\nZero Emissions (NZE) scenarios.2 We continue to assess appropriate scenario benchmarks, such as the use \nof Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor (CRREM) to benchmark our Commercial Real Estate portfolio. For more \ninformation on scenario selection, see page 22 in Citi’s 2021 TCFD Report. \nAuto Manufacturing  \nOur Auto Manufacturing methodology is focused on Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) producing \nlight-duty vehicles, which are responsible for approximately half of transport sector emissions. Medium- \nand heavy-duty vehicles are expected to require different technologies as the transition to a low-carbon \neconomy progresses; given these distinctions, Citi has at this time excluded medium- and heavy-duty \nmanufacturers from its Auto Manufacturing boundary.\nFor the Auto Manufacturing sector , we used the PCAF methodology to calculate the absolute financed \nemissions using outstanding fund amounts and also ran the calculations using committed funds. For data \nsources, we utilized the following:\n • S&P Global Trucost dataset\n • Production data from LMC Automotive, a GlobalData Company\n2 For our Steel portfolio, we have utilized the RMI Methodology. Please see below.\n20 | TCFD REPORT 2022: CITI’S APPROACH TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND NET ZERO\n • PCAF emissions factor database\nAutomotive production data included, among other items, the number of vehicles produced by each OEM, \nand was used to estimate tailpipe emissions where needed and to calculate the physical intensity metric. In \ndetermining whether to set an absolute- or intensity-based emissions target, we considered how a target \nfor this sector may accommodate continued growth in this sector and growing demand for mobility, but \nin a manner that facilitates decarbonization. We have therefore set an intensity-based emissions target \nfor this sector . We benchmarked against the NZE 2050 scenario to determine our decarbonization \npathway and set our interim 2030 goal, in alignment with our already-established Energy target, which \nrelies on the same assumptions for decarbonization across the two sectors. \nThermal Coal Mining  \nThe net zero boundary for our baseline and target includes companies deriving at least 5% of their \nrevenue from thermal coal mining activities, a broader boundary than that of our Environmental and \nSocial Risk Management (ESRM) Policy3. We are using total committed funds to calculate our financed \nemissions baseline. We used S&P Global Trucost for emissions data and supplemented this with production \nand revenue data. Our data quality, per the PCAF hierarchy, scored 3.1 (out of 5), reflecting our reliance on \nproduction data (the availability of emissions data in this area is limited by a lower number of companies \ndisclosing such information). \nWe have selected an absolute emissions target for this sector using the International Energy Agency \nSustainable Development Scenario, OECD Pathway (“IEA SDS OECD”) as guidance. When benchmarking \nagainst the IEA SDS OECD scenario, which is a more ambitious pathway compared to NZE 2050 due to \nexpectations that OECD countries will decarbonize sooner than the overall global approach, the implied \ntarget reduction is 83.5% by 2030. We have decided to raise that thermal coal financed emissions \nreduction target to 90%. The ESRM Policy targets a 100% credit exposure phaseout by 2030 for \ncompanies deriving ≥ 25% of their revenue from thermal coal mining, and our Net Zero Plan sets an \nemissions reduction target of 90% for companies deriving ≥5% of their revenue from thermal coal mining. \n3 Our ESRM policy applies to companies that derive ≥25% of their revenues from thermal coal mining. Under the ESRM Policy, by the end \nof 2025, Citi will have reduced its credit exposure to thermal coal mining companies by 50% from a 2020 baseline; after 2025, we will no \nlonger facilitate capital markets transactions or mergers and acquisition advisory and financing for these companies; and by the end of \n2030, our remaining exposure to such companies will be zero.\nTCFD REPORT 2022: CITI’S APPROACH TO CLIMATE\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
