Through our partnership \nwith Tealbook and Minority Supplier Development UK (MSDUK), we conducted a baseline \nassessment of our supplier base. We have identified that 3% of our spend with suppliers is \nallocated to diverse / small business, and we identified several opportunities to improve our \nsourcing practices to be more inclusive as well as enhance our internal training and adoption \nof the programme. We look forward to evolving this partnership with Tealbook and MSDUK \nduring the coming year.\nThis year, we also signed an agreement with Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) Supply Chain \nto engage with 500 of our most important suppliers, throughout the next financial year, \nto better understand their carbon footprint and net zero plans.\nConflict minerals and cobalt\nWe have improved oversight of our conflict minerals and cobalt portfolio of suppliers – in line \nwith both our Conflict Minerals & Cobalt Policy and the OECD’s Due Diligence Guidance for \nResponsible Supply Chains or Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas.\nCurrent global regulation defines “conflict minerals” as tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold  \n(3TG). This year, we voluntarily updated our existing policy and due diligence process to \ninclude cobalt as well. We believe this puts us in a good position for future legislation that is \nexpected to classify this metal as a conflict mineral in years to come. To support this, we have \nprovided refresher training sessions to our employees, who are involved in the collection and \nverification of Conflict Minerals Reporting Templates (CMRTs) and Extended Minerals \nReporting Templates (EMRTs) of the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI). We are actively \nengaging in conversation through our supplier partnering programmes to understand greater \ndetail about the content of 3TGs and cobalt supplied in products to us.\nOf the 3TGs, we principally buy tungsten for use in our autocatalyst products, though we \nrecognise we may have small amounts of the others in finished goods and refining intakes. \nFor calendar year 2022, we identified 79 suppliers providing 3TGs and cobalt going into our \nproducts. All have provided us with due diligence industry standard reporting templates. Out \nof the responses, seven of these suppliers did not fully meet our policy expectations (two for \n3TG, three for cobalt and two for both 3TG and cobalt). Where non-compliance with our \npolicy has been identified, we are working with suppliers to remediate this.\nPlatinum group metals\nAlong with our customers, we work with industry associations like the International Platinum Group \nMetals Association (IPA) to ensure we source our PGMs in an ethical way. We are pleased to support \nmembers’ adoption of the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (IRMA) responsible mining \nstandard. We recognise it is a significant undertaking to achieve full IRMA certification for mining \noperations and continue to support our suppliers on this journey.\n More on the IRMA responsible mining standard: matthey.com/IRMA\nOur own UK and US refineries are on the London Platinum and Palladium Market’s (LPPM) \n‘Good Delivery’ lists for platinum and palladium and are subject to its Responsible Platinum \nand Palladium Guidance (RPPG). This standard requires us to demonstrate that we have high \nethical standards and traceability of metal in our supply chains. We are third-party audited, \nby RCS Global, annually to confirm our ongoing compliance. \n Annual LLP compliance: matthey.com/LPP-compliance\nForestry products\nAfter identifying the presence of palm oil in our supply chain, we moved to ensure we only \npurchase palm oil from sustainable sources, as set out in our Supplier Code of Conduct. We \nare now certified members of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) and expect to \nbe audited against the RSPO Supply Chain Certification Standard by an accredited certification \nbody in the next financial year.\nDoing business in higher-risk jurisdictions \nIn 2022, we ceased all new commercial sales activity in Russia and closed our Moscow office. \nDuring 2022/23, we also put our production facility in Krasnoyarsk in dormant status.\nWe source a number of raw materials critical to our products from China, including PGMs, \nrare earth metals and zeolites. During the year we conducted due diligence on Tier 1 raw \nmaterial suppliers with a presence in China. No major concerns have been identified. We \ncontinue the process of reviewing the detailed due diligence and will implement mitigations \nor put remedial actions in place, as required.\nPeople: Promoting a safe, diverse and equitable
