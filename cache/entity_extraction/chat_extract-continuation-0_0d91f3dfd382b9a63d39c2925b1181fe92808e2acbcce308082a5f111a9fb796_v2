The principal assumptions in the estimation of the liability relate to the expected \nfrequency, severity and settlement patterns of insurance claims, which are expected to be consistent with recently \nobserved experience and trends. The aim of claims reserving is to select assumptions and reserving methods that \nwill produce the best estimate of the future cash outflows for the subject claims; it is an uncertain process which \nalso requires judgements to be made. The resulting provisions for outstanding claims incorporate a margin for \nadverse deviation, over and above the best estimate liability, the quantum of which reflects the level of this \nuncertainty. \nClaims development patterns are analysed in each of the Group’s insurance entities. Where distinct sub-portfolios \nwith different claims cost and development characteristics exist, further analysis is undertaken to derive \nassumptions for reserving that are appropriate and can be applied to relatively homogeneous groups of policies. \nSuch sub-portfolios may be defined by product line, risk profile, geography or market sector. Various established \nreserving methods for general insurance are considered, typically basic chain ladder, Bornhuetter-Ferguson and \npure risk cost methods. Additional consideration is given to the treatment of large claims, claim seasonality, claims \ninflation and currency effects, for which appropriate adjustments to assumptions and methods are made. \nWhile there is some diversity in the development profile of health insurance claims across the Group, such claims \nare generally highly predictable in both frequency and average amount, and claims are settled quickly following \nthe medical event for which benefit is claimed. Medical expense claims are, typically, substantially fully-settled \nwithin just a few months. \nInsurance provisions are inevitably estimates. Actual experience of claims costs and/or administrative expenses \nmay vary from that anticipated in the reserving estimates. Deferred claims provisions that have been recognised \nbecause the Group has a constructive obligation to reserve for deferred claims are calculated separately from the \nbase outstanding claims provision. \nThe following table shows the impact on profit before taxation of reasonably possible variations in assumptions \nin the carrying value of insurance contract liabilities at the end of the reporting period: \nIncrease in claims Increase in expenses \n2022 \nChange in variable 5% 10% \nReduction in profit net of reinsurance before taxation¹ £32m £2m \n2021 \nChange in variable 5% 10% \nReduction in profit net of reinsurance before taxation¹ £32m £2m \n1. The deferred claims provision of £181m (2021: £163m) has been excluded from this sensitivity. \nThese variances would reduce the amount of profit before taxation that would otherwise emerge in \nsubsequent periods. \n19.2 Other liabilities arising from insurance business \nOther liabilities arising from insurance business consist of payables to insurance creditors. \n2022 2021 \n£m £m \nReinsurers' deposits 9 8 \nReinsurance creditors 77 61 \nCommissions payable 42 39 \nOther insurance payables 93 105 \nTotal other liabilities arising from insurance business 221 213 \nIncluded within other insurance payables is £38m (2021: £57m) related to announced and yet to be paid cash \ngivebacks associated with the return of COVID-19 savings to customers of Bupa Health Insurance, Australia. \nBupa Annual Report 2022 177 \n \n \n  \n  \n      \n            \n       \n                 \n                  \n                 \n                   \n      \n                 \n                \n    \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n                    \n                  \n                  \n                  \n                   \n    \n                 \n                 \n   \n                  \n                \n                \n    \n                 \n                 \n                  \n                   \n                 \n            \n    \n               \n                  \n                  \n         \n  \n                   \n                 \n                 \n                  \n          \n          \n      \n   \nStrategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements \nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \ncontinued \nNote 20: \nProvisions for \nliabilities and \ncharges \nProvisions for liabilities and charges in brief \nA provision is recognised when the Group is expected to make future \npayments as a result of a past event. \nThese payments can result from a legal obligation or a constructive obligation, where an expectation has been \ncreated by the Group. A provision is made where an outflow of resources is probable and where the payments \ncan be reliably estimated. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the estimated future \npayments at a pre-taxation rate that reflects a current market assessment of the time value of money and, where \nappropriate, the risks specific to the liability. \nAlthough provisions are made where payments can be reliably estimated, the amounts provided are based on a \nnumber of assumptions which are inherently uncertain and therefore the amounts that are ultimately paid could \ndiffer from the amounts recorded. \nLong Customer Provision for NHS dental \nservice and remediation underpayment Property contract \nannual and legal Insurance of employee restoration clawback \nleave provisions provisions entitlement provision provision Other Total \n2022 £m £m £m £m £m £m £m £m \nAt beginning of year 95 16 9 62 27 21 49\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BUPA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Bupa is a global healthcare group providing health insurance, medical services, and related healthcare products, as referenced in the annual report 2022)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUPA HEALTH INSURANCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A division of Bupa offering health insurance services, including COVID-19 savings return to customers in Australia)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUSTRALIA<|>GEO<|>Country where Bupa Health Insurance operates and returned COVID-19 savings to customers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>2022<|>EVENT<|>The year for which the financial and operational data are reported in the Bupa Annual Report)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19<|>EVENT<|>Global pandemic impacting health insurance policies and customer savings returns, specifically mentioned in relation to Australian health insurance customers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REINSURERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Entities that hold deposits and creditors related to reinsurance activities, such as reinsurers' deposits and reinsurance creditors)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REINSURERS' DEPOSITS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Financial assets held by the company as deposits from reinsurers, amounting to £9m in 2022)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REINSURANCE CREDITORS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Liabilities owed to reinsurers, totaling £77m in 2022)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COVID-19 SAVINGS<|>EVENT<|>Return of savings to customers of Bupa Health Insurance in Australia, related to COVID-19 impact)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROVISIONS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Provisions for liabilities and charges, including long customer provisions, legal provisions, and other liabilities, as detailed in the notes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LONG CUSTOMER PROVISION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Provision set aside for NHS dental service and remediation underpayment, part of the provisions for liabilities and charges)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEGAL PROVISIONS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Provisions related to legal obligations, included in the overall provisions for liabilities and charges)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INSURANCE PROVISIONS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Provisions for insurance liabilities, including estimates for future claims and associated expenses)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BUPA<|>AUSTRALIA<|>Bupa operates in Australia and returned COVID-19 savings to customers<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BUPA<|>REINSURERS<|>Reinsurers hold deposits and credits related to Bupa's reinsurance activities<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BUPA<|>PROVISIONS<|>Bupa has provisions for liabilities and charges, including long customer, legal, and other provisions<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COVID-19<|>AUSTRALIA<|>COVID-19 pandemic led to return of savings to Australian health insurance customers<|>6)\n##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
