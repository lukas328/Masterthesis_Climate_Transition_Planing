We have incorporated climate-change related financial stress testing into our \nstress testing programme and will continue to enhance our approach to stress \ntesting in the coming years, including expanding the range of stress tests and \nscenario analysis performed. To date: \n▪ Bupa has utilised two scenarios from the Prudential Regulation Authority \n(PRA) Climate Biennial Exploratory Scenario (CBES) (although Bupa was \nnot formally invited to participate) to help explore the possible impacts \nto the Group balance sheet from climate change over a 30-year horizon: \n▪ ‘Late Action’: a ~2°C, disorderly transition scenario, achieving net zero \nby 2050 (comparable to the Network for Greening the Finance System \n(NGFS) Disorderly scenario), and \n▪ ‘No Additional Action’: a 4.1°C scenario with high physical risk due to a \nlack of transition (comparable to the NGFS Hot House World and the \nRepresentative Scenario Pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenarios). \n▪ The scenarios analysed the potential property-related financial impacts from \ndevaluations, increased adaptation costs, and increased insurance premiums. \nThe scenarios also analysed the potential impacts on our investment \nportfolio and the value of Bupa’s debt. \n▪ Our 2022 Stress and Scenario Testing programme (SST) also included a \nrange of Global and local (i.e. Business Unit) scenarios, analysing impacts \nfrom a broader range of sensitivities which could be driven by climate \nchange (although not exclusively), such as global inflation to insurance \nclaims and expenses (could be driven by an energy price shock or carbon \npricing), and local Business Unit level scenarios modelled potential impacts \ndriven by strategic workforce risks, supply chain disruption and regulatory \nchanges. \n▪ The results of our scenario analysis to date, based on the scope of our \nfinancial analysis as described above, suggest that our strategy is resilient \nto the financial risks from climate change. \n▪ In 2023 we will continue to evolve our approach to scenario analysis and \nwill broaden our scenario analysis to better understand how climate change \ncould impact our health insurance business, and to help identify how climate \nrisk will impact our supplies and supply chains. \nWe continue to evolve and mature our climate scenario analysis along with our \ndisclosure approach. \nThe global scope 1 and 2 decarbonisation roadmap referenced on page 25 will \nalso take into consideration scenarios that model energy price volatility and \nfuture viability of new technologies, allowing us to accurately identify the best \nadaptation and mitigation options for our different sites in different geographies. \nBupa Annual Report 2022 104 \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n             \n            \n           \n             \n          \n          \n           \n            \n        \n          \n   \n            \n            \n          \n          \n          \n             \n            \n        \n     \n         \n          \n        \n         \n         \n           \n         \n          \n           \n     \n         \n           \n               \n           \n     \n          \n           \n            \n        \n        \n          \n           \n            \n           \n \n   \n   \n  \n  \n    \n   \n \n  \n   \n    \n    \n  \n  \n \n  \n   \n  \n     \n  \n \n \n          \n          \n   \n   \n   \nStrategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements \nTask Force on Climate-related \nFinancial Disclosures (TCFD) continued \nTCFD \nrecommendation Details and our progress in 2022 Where can I find out more? \nRisk \nmanagement \nA.

We have identified which of our significant risks may be affected by climate \nchange, and defined our approach to managing these risks.
