Any increase will take into account the market rate for \nthe relevant positions within the comparator group of similarly sized companies with a comparable \ninternational presence and geographic spread and operating in relevant industry sectors and the \nexperience of the individuals and the expected time commitment of the role.\nIn exceptional circumstances, additional fees or non-executive benefits (e.g. assistance with tax filings or \nan allowance for intercontinental travel including any associated tax) may be payable to reflect a \nsubstantial increase in time commitment.\nThe company will also reimburse the Chair and non-executive directors for all reasonable expenses \n(including any tax thereon) incurred while carrying out duties for the company.\nDetails of the current fee levels for the Chair and non-executive directors \nare set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration on page 119.\nThe fee levels are set subject to the maximum limits set out in the \ncompany’s Articles of Association.\nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 2023110\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION\nRemuneration Policy continued\nThe committee is responsible for determining, and agreeing with the board, the Directors’ Remuneration Policy and has oversight of its implementation. The committee has clear terms \nof reference, works with management and independent advisers to develop proposals and recommendations, and exercises independent judgement when making decisions. This process \nis considered to manage any potential conflicts of interest.\nThe policy is performance focused and, given the long-term nature of JM’s business, is weighted towards long-term performance and includes market standard shareholding expectations \nand recovery and withholding provisions.\nThe committee considered the principles listed in the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code when reviewing the Directors’ Remuneration Policy and took these into account in its design \nand implementation.\nClarity Remuneration arrangements have defined parameters which can be transparently communicated to shareholders and other stakeholders.\nSimplicity Remuneration arrangements for executive directors consist of:\n• Salary, benefits, and a fixed pension contribution – set to reflect the typical rate provided to the UK workforce.\n• Annual Incentive Plan (AIP), a portion of which is deferred into shares.\n• Annual long-term Performance Share Plan (PSP) awards which provide focus on performance over the longer term.\nUnnecessary complexity is avoided by the committee in operating the arrangements. \nRisk The remuneration arrangements are designed to have a robust link between pay and performance, thereby mitigating the risk of excessive reward. In addition, \nbehavioural risks are considered when setting targets for performance-related pay, and the arrangements have safeguards to ensure that pay remains appropriate, \nincluding committee discretion to adjust incentive outturns, deferral of incentive payments in shares, recovery provisions and share ownership requirements. \nTo avoid conflicts of interest, committee members are required to disclose any conflicts or potential conflicts ahead of committee meetings. No executive director \nor other member of management is present when their own remuneration is under discussion.\nPredictability The committee set specific targets for different levels of performance which are communicated to the individuals and disclosed to shareholders.\nProportionality The AIP and PSP have performance metrics that are aligned with the company’s KPIs, and the payouts reflect achievement against the targets. The committee \nmay reduce payouts under the AIP and PSP if they are not considered aligned with underlying performance. Safeguards are identified to ensure that poor \nperformance is not rewarded.\nAlignment to culture The directors’ remuneration arrangements are cascaded through the organisation ensuring that there are common goals. The committee reviews remuneration \narrangements throughout the company and takes these into account when setting directors’ remuneration.\nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 2023 111\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION\nRemuneration Policy continued\nSelection of performance targets\nAnnual Incentive Plan\nFinancial performance targets under the AIP are set by the Remuneration Committee \nwith reference to the prior year and to the budgets and business plans for the coming year, \nensuring the levels to achieve threshold, target or maximum payout are appropriately \nchallenging.\nThe performance targets for 2023/24 are predominantly based on financial measures \n(70% of maximum opportunity) including budgeted underlying PBT and working capital \ndays to ensure that there is strong attention paid to delivery of current operational plans \nand operational efficiency.\nCommercial sensitivity precludes the advance publication of the actual bonus targets, \nbut these targets will be retrospectively published in the Annual Report on Remuneration \nfor 2023/24.\nPerformance Share Plan\nThe performance targets under the PSP are set to reflect the company’s longer-term \ngrowth objectives at a level where the maximum represents genuine outperformance. \nThe performance measures are currently based on underlying EPS, TSR and strategic \nobjectives (including sustainability).\nUnderlying EPS is considered a simple and clear measure of absolute growth in line with \nthe company’s strategy.\nTSR is considered a simple and clear performance relative to a comparator group \n(FTSE 31-100 excluding financial services companies).\nThe strategic objectives will consist of four equally weighted metrics. For 2023/24, \nthree metrics will relate to our sustainability framework, and one will relate to a business \ntransformation objective.\nDiscretion\nThe Remuneration Committee can exercise discretion in a number of areas when operating \nthe company’s incentive plans, in line with the relevant rules of the plan. These include \n(but are not limited to):\n• The choice of participants\n• The size of awards in any year (subject to the limits set out in the Directors’ Remuneration\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
