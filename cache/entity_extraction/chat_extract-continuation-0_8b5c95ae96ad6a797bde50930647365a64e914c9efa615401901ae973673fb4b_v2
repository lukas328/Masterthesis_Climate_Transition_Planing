Over the past \nyear, investments in sustainable projects \nhave increased by 138%, this being the \nstrategic priority that has grown the most. \nIn 2022 the investments made in the risk \narea stand out, such as the PACTA (Paris \nAgreement Capital T ransition Assessment) \nand PCAF (Partnership for Carbon \nAccounting Financials) integration projects, \nkey pieces for the alignment of the Bank’s \nportfolio towards decarbonization goals.\nP.  34\nBBVA Report on TCFD 2022\nThis English version is a translation of the original in Spanish for information purposes only.

The FTP is a vitally important \ntool for pricing the products offered by \nthe bank to reflect the cost of liquidity and \nfunding for each transaction and serve as a \nmajor component for measuring profitability.  \nIn this sense, it is critical that the FTP \nsystem is aligned with the Group’s strategic \npriorities. Thus, it is a lever which aims to \nsupport customers towards a sustainable \nand inclusive future.\nBBVA has a corporate FTP methodology that \nis reviewed within the scope of the Corporate \nAsset Liability Committee, which represents \nthe basis for the rest of the Group’s \ngeographical areas.\nIn the first quarter of 2021, the corporate \nmethodology was revised in order to \nrecognize the lower funding cost of green \nand social bond issues placed in the market \ncompared to conventional bond issues, and \nto translate this improvement into eligible \ntransactions for green and social bond \ncollateral.\nInvestment in new technologies\nInvesting in “venture capital” funds is a key \npart of the Group’s strategy to learn about \nnew technologies in order to generate \nbusiness and financial returns. Thus, in \n2022, the Group increased its investments \nrelated to technologies that address \nthe major challenge of decarbonization. \nDuring 2022, BBVA entered funds such as \nHy24, which seeks to invest in industrial \nprojects that bring green hydrogen-based \nsolutions to commercial scale; Lowercarbon, \nwhich invests in companies that develop \ntechnologies to absorb carbon directly \nfrom the atmosphere; or Fifth Wall Climate, \na leader in “proptech, ” with a fund that \nseeks to decarbonize the value chain of the \nconstruction and real estate sector.\n2. Achieve Net Zero 2050\nBBVA is one of the founding banks of the \nNet Zero Banking Alliance and, as such, has \nacquired the commitment to be neutral in \ncarbon emissions (“Net Zero”) by 2050. T o \nthis end, the Bank is applying the strategy of \nalignment of portfolio and management of \nindirect emissions.\n2.1. Risk management and \nportfolio alignment\nIn recent years, significant progress has \nbeen made:\n Setting intermediate decarbonization \ntargets for 2030 in emissions financed in \nsix sectors: oil & gas, power generation, \nautos, steel, cement and coal (the \ntarget for oil & gas was set in 2022). \nDecarbonization targets were also set for \nthe BBVA Asset Management portfolio \nin 2022. The goals for each sector can \nbe found in  Alignment of metrics and goals  \nsection.\n Developing specific tools to measure \nclients’ transition to a low-carbon \neconomy that are integrated into credit \npolicies. For example, a T ransition Risk \nIndicator, which is a combination of two \nmetrics (climate change awareness and \nclient assessment of the transition path) \nthat, together with credit policies, provide \na comprehensive assessment of each \nclient’s transition. \n Implementing a governance model that \nensures the execution and monitoring \nof objectives.\nP.  35\nBBVA Report on TCFD 2022\nThis English version is a translation of the original in Spanish for information purposes only.
