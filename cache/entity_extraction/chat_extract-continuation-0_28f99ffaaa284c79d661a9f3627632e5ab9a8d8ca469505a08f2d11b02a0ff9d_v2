Of those that incorporate emissions targets, \nthere are different criteria for the types of targets that can and cannot be used. \n • Methodologies vary in their use of Scope 1, Scope 2, and/or Scope 3 GHG emissions. Some use only Scope 1 \ndata, while others use Scope 1 and 2, and yet others take Scope 1, 2, and 3 GHG emissions into account. \n • Certain methodologies take cumulative historical GHG emissions into account while others incorporate \npoint-in-time assessments of emissions intensity. \n • Methodologies may incorporate different climate-related scenarios or emissions pathways, or even utilise \ninternal proprietary future emissions pathways. \n • Certain methodologies may be better suited to assessing certain asset classes and may vary in whether some \nasset classes can be assessed at all. \n • Variations in methodologies may also lead to under – or overestimates of implied temperature rise, and \nconsequently an exaggerated indication of climate-related risk.\nMoreover, some available methodologies may only include a limited number of technologies and indicators, while \nother important levers/indicators that are needed to understand transition risks and opportunities in certain sectors \nmay not be included. \n5) Limitations of climate scenario analysis and the models that analyse them\n • The practice of modelling the impact of climate-related risks on the financial sector is improving rapidly but \nremains under development. As a result, there are currently a number of limitations with respect to data and \nanalysis techniques, which should be borne in mind. \n • Scenarios are not forecasts (they do not mean to predict future outcomes); rather they are projections of \nalternative plausible futures that are designed to build an understanding of the nature and size of changes that \nmay occur in future. They do not reflect all possible future pathways.\n • Predicting climate change and quantifying its impacts on the economy is inherently complex – in how the \nimpacts of climate change will impact asset values, how companies will react to regulatory and market \npressures, as well as how NatWest Group’s customers will react and adapt to these impacts. \n • Like any modelling, the further out the projection, the greater the uncertainties. When interpreting model \noutputs, it may be that the direction of change is more useful for decision-making than point estimates within \none scenario’s results. \n • Climate scenarios and the models that analyse them have limitations that are sensitive to key assumptions and \nparameters, which are themselves subject to some uncertainty.\n • Climate scenarios cannot fully capture all of the potential effects of climate, policy and technology driven \noutcomes. For example, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projects that substantial \ndeployment of negative emissions technologies, such as biomass energy with carbon capture and storage  \n(CCS), would be required to achieve a 1.5°C outcome, and many analysts draw similar conclusions about \nreaching 2°C. The cost and availability of such technologies has a significant effect on the estimated price of \ncarbon that would be required to deploy them. Other things being equal, models that assume the availability of \nlow-cost CCS or other as-yet-nascent technology will project more modest carbon prices to achieve stringent \nclimate change mitigation goals. Models that assume limited availability of these technologies at low cost will \nproject higher costs to achieve the same climate goals. \n • Scientific understanding of climate change continues to develop. This may enable a more granular and precise \nunderstanding of some kinds of climate-related risks in future. \n • Finally, models cannot fully capture the range of societal changes that could result from climate change. These \ncould include changes in dietary preferences, migration patterns, and political preferences. As climate continues \nto change, decision-makers will respond in ways that can both create and alleviate risks. The costs of models \ndo not fully capture the possibility of low-probability but high-impact risks and opportunities. Market actor and \npolicymaker responses are complex and should be considered qualitatively along with a quantitative scenario \nanalysis. Some of these limitations are inherent to many models but are in this case further exacerbated by the \noften-multi-decade time horizon and the complexity and interdependencies of the effects modelled, from ice \nsheets melting to agricultural yields and migration: To mitigate the limitations of scenarios and modelling, \npractitioners should analyse multiple scenarios with various underlying assumptions and parameters. \nOver reliance by regulators or financial institutions on a limited number of the same prescribed models or scenarios \n(e.g., the NGFS scenarios) may amplify systemic climate-related risks.\n92NatWest Group plc | 2022 Climate-related Disclosures Report\nGovernance Strategy and Climate transition plan Risk Management and Scenario Analysis Metrics and TargetsIntroduction\nCautions about climate-related metrics, data and methodology challenges continued\nCaution about judgments, assumptions and estimates, the lack of commonly accepted reporting \npractices, the non-comparability of information and the lack of definitions or standards.\nThe preparation of certain information in this report requires the application of a number of key judgments, \nassumptions and estimates, including with respect to the classification of climate and sustainable funding and \nfinancing activities.
