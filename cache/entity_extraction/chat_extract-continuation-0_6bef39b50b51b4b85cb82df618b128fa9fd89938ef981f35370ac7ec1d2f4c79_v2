The first ASCOR assessment results have been \npublished  on countries’ progress on managing climate change. \nThere is a growing emissions gap due to a lack of \nambition in countries’ targets and trends. Nearly all \nassessed countries have set an emissions reduction \ntarget, but very few align with a pathway that limits \nthe global temperature rise to 1.5°C.\nThere is an implementation gap with insufficient \npolicies, particularly at the sector level, to meet \nemissions reduction targets. Weak or non-existent \ncommitments to phase out fossil fuels, both subsidies \nand production, jeopardise a net-zero future.\nThere is an international climate finance gap.
