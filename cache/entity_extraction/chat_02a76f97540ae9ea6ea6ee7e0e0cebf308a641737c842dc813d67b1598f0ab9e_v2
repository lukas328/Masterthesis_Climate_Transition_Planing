This was partially offset by \ncash returns to customers and premium increase \ndeferrals in our Australian health insurance business \nwhere we delivered on our commitment to not \nbenefit from COVID-19. Insurance customer growth \nof 8% represented nearly one million more lives \n(16% when including our associate businesses) driven \nby strong growth in the UK and continued growth \nin our Australian, Polish, Turkish, Spanish and \nBrazilian businesses. \nIn health provision, revenue grew by 8%, reflecting over \ntwo million additional customers as demand for health \nservices increased and the impacts of COVID-19 largely \nsubsided, but still remained in places. Dental revenue \nhowever was impacted by sector-wide clinician \nshortages across several of our markets and the \ndivestment of some practices in New Zealand. \nIn aged care, revenue was up 4% as occupancy rates \nincreased by 1.6 ppts driven by our Spanish and UK \nbusinesses as they continued to emerge from the \npandemic. COVID-19 challenges remained in our \nAustralian and New Zealand businesses, however, \nas localised restrictions and sector-wide staffing \navailability continued to impact our ability to welcome \nnew residents and reduced occupancy rates in \nthis region. \nUnderlying profit (CER) \nGroup underlying profit increased by 43% to £575m \n(FY 2021: £402m at CER). \nUnderlying profit includes one-off items that are related \nto trading but are exceptional in nature. There was \n£66m of additional profit in Asia Pacific which we have \nattributed to undistributed health insurance claims \nsavings related to COVID-19. This is intended to be \nreturned to customers in the future in line with our \ncommitment to not benefit from the pandemic. In \nEurope and Latin America, profits were £40m higher \nas a result of applying higher CPI to rates in historical \nperiods in line with a Public Private Partnership hospital \ncontract in Spain. In our BGUK Market Unit, UK Dental \nhas been impacted by higher Weighted Average \nCost of Capital (WACC) rates and reduced profit \nexpectations which has led to impairments of \ngoodwill, customer intangibles, fixed assets and right \nof use leases. The tangible asset impairments are £117m \nand are included in underlying profit. The net impact of \nthese across our Market Units was an £11m downside. \nFor our largest line of business, health insurance, \nunderlying profit increased from good customer \ngrowth, alongside both premium increases and \ncareful cost management, which broadly offset \nhigher claims and operating costs caused by the \ninflationary environment. \nAs noted on page 11, in Chile, we continue to see \nthe negative impacts of judicial and regulatory action \naffecting the entire Isapre insurance industry which \nhave caused underlying losses to grow in our Isapre \nbusiness, Isapre Cruz Blanca. \nProfitability further increased in our health provision \nbusinesses, as COVID-19 restrictions reduced in 2022. \nHowever, we continue to see challenges in our dental \nbusiness, particularly in the UK, driven by sector-wide \npressures, including an ongoing shortage of available \nclinician hours. \nUnderlying losses in aged care increased year-on-year. \nIn Spain, profits improved from higher customer \nvolumes as the business emerged from the pandemic \n(closing occupancy 92.8% was up 5.9 ppts). However, \nthis was more than offset by challenges in Australia and \nNew Zealand which were impacted from temporary \nclosures in the first half of 2022, resulting from \nCOVID-19, along with workforce availability constraints, \nand in the UK, which faced higher staff and energy \ncosts in a heightened inflationary environment. \nCentral expenses and net interest margin of £43m \nwere lower (FY 2021: £103m at CER). This was driven by \nhigher investment returns from increased interest rates, \nand reduced costs\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
