This directly aligns \nwith our company purpose to enable the sustainable and efficient \ndelivery of the natural resources essential to create a better future for \nthe world. We discuss the broader impact of the transition to a low-\ncarbon economy, including risks and opportunities in the markets for \ncommodities produced by our customers and their technology needs, \nin our TCFD report (see pages 56 to 59).\nOUR EMISSIONS PROFILE \nWe track and report GHG emissions across our full value chain and\nfrom this we know that:\n• the overwhelming majority, 97%, of Weir Group’s end-to-end\ncarbon footprint is attributable to downstream value-chain scope 3, \nspecifically the use phase of our long-lifespan products and\nsolutions on our customers’ sites - these are, in turn, within our \ncustomers’ scope 1&2 emissions, so we have a compelling shared\ngoal to reduce that footprint; \n• Upstream supply chain scope 3 emissions make up another 2.5%, \npredominantly purchased goods and services and transport; and\n• Scope 1&2 emissions from our own operations make up0.5%.\nThis resolutely validates our sustainability roadmap strategic priority of \nCreating Sustainable Solutions. We believe we can reduce our scope\n3 emissions and enable net zero for our customers' operations by \nshaping the next generation of smart, efficient and sustainable\nsolutions with cutting-edge science and our tradition of innovation. \nHowever, as a company we are committed to measuring, reporting\nand reducing emissions across our full value chain.\nScope 1&2 emissions – Weir Group’s own operations.\nThis category includes emissions from within our operations within\nour management control, including energy used in manufacturing\nand other facilities. We track consumption of all forms of energy and\ngreenhouse gases in our facilities and quantify emissions quarterly \nfor internal monitoring purposes, in addition to annual external \nreporting. Scope 1&2 market-based emissions in 2022 are below \nour SBTi commitments at around17% below the 2019 baseline \nof 184 ktCO2e (see Sustainability Review, page 45). \nOne challenge for Weir is that we manufacture a high proportion\nof products in our own foundries and therefore recognise a higher \nproportion of emissions in scopes 1&2 than if we were to export \nemissions to scope 3 by contracting out manufacturing. This \nhighlights the importance of comprehensive emissions disclosure, \nincluding the impact of purchased goods and services.\nScope 3 emissions – Weir Group’s upstream and \ndownstream value chain.\nEmissions from right across our value chain, other than within our \nown operations, fall within scope 3. This ranges from sourcing of \nmaterials through to the recycling or disposal of products at the end\nof life. While we are identifying actions to reduce emissions from \nmaterials and components that we buy, as well as transport \nemissions, these categories and associated costs are not material to\nour target delivery. Our footprint is heavily weighted downstream in\nour customers’ sites because our products are used in the most \nenergy intensive parts of the mine – the load-haul cycle and in\ncomminution. So, as we grow and sell more products into our \ngrowing markets, the result would be additional scope 3 emissions. \nThis is why our technology strategy is geared towards providing new \nor improved technologies that help our customers use energy more\nefficiently, which together with their own commitments to source\nrenewable energy, helps to reduce our scope 3 footprint.\nSCIENCE BASED TARGETS\nIn 2022, we were pleased to submit new, more ambitious scope 1,2\nand 3 emissions reduction targets to the Science Based Targets \nInitiative (SBTi) for validation. The new targets include absolute \nreductions in market-based scope 1& 2 emissions of 30% and scope \n3 emissions of 15% by 2030, versus a 2019 baseline. The targets are\nmore ambitious than our previous goals, set in 2020, in two ways:\n• switching from an intensity to an absolute emissions reduction\nbasis will drive deeper cuts in scope 1& 2 emissions; and\n• the new scope 3 commitment adds targets for emissions in Weir’s \nupstream and downstream value chain for the first time.\nThese new targets will make a significant contribution to\ndecarbonising the mining industry. Delivering them would mean that \nin 2030, an annual reduction of circa 4.2 million tonnes CO2e is \nachieved – which is equivalent to the annual emissions of almost one\nmillion petrol cars. \nSCOPE 4 – EMISSIONS AVOIDED BY THE TAKE-UP OF \nENERGY EFFICIENT TECHNOLOGIES BY CUSTOMERS \nThe comparative measure between the emissions of one technology \nversus an alternative has the term scope 4 – avoided emissions. It’s \nan emerging term that’s not currently covered in the greenhouse gas \nreporting protocol. However, it has the potential to quantify the\nsustainability benefit of our products and solutions and thereby \nsupport our customers in delivering their net zero targets.\nBecause it’s a comparative rather than absolute measure, quantifying\nscope 4 benefit is complex. So we are using a data-driven approach, \ndevised by internal and external subject matter experts, and which we\nintend to have validated by a third party. This will underpin two value\ndrivers for We\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>WEIR GROUP<|><|>organization<|>Weir Group is a company focused on manufacturing and providing solutions aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions across its value chain, with strategic goals aligned with sustainability and net-zero commitments)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCIENCE BASED TARGETS INITIATIVE<|><|>organization<|>The Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) is an organization that validates companies' emissions reduction targets to ensure they align with climate science and global decarbonization goals)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLIMATE CHANGE<|><|>event<|>Climate change refers to the long-term alteration of Earth's climate patterns, driven largely by human activities such as greenhouse gas emissions, which the company aims to combat through its sustainability efforts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCOPE 1&2 EMISSIONS<|><|>organization<|>Scope 1&2 emissions are direct emissions from a company's own operations and energy use, which Weir Group monitors and reports as part of its sustainability strategy)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCOPE 3 EMISSIONS<|><|>organization<|>Scope 3 emissions encompass indirect emissions across the entire value chain, including upstream supply chain and downstream product use, which constitute the majority of Weir Group's carbon footprint)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOW-CARBON ECONOMY<|><|>event<|>The transition to a low-carbon economy involves shifting towards sustainable energy sources and reducing carbon emissions, a process that the company discusses in relation to market risks and opportunities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NET ZERO<|><|>event<|>Net zero refers to balancing emitted greenhouse gases with removal or offsetting measures, which Weir Group aims to achieve for its own operations and to enable its customers to reach through innovative solutions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUSTAINABILITY ROADMAP<|><|>organization<|>The sustainability roadmap is Weir Group's strategic plan to reduce emissions, develop sustainable solutions, and promote environmental responsibility across its operations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RENEWABLE ENERGY<|><|>organization<|>Renewable energy includes sources like wind, solar, and hydro power, which Weir Group encourages its customers to adopt to help reduce scope 3 emissions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MINING INDUSTRY<|><|>event<|>The mining industry is a significant energy-intensive sector that the company aims to decarbonize through technological innovations and sustainable practices)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GAS EMISSIONS<|><|>organization<|>Greenhouse gases (GHGs) such as CO2, which are emitted from company operations and product use, and are tracked and reported by Weir Group as part of its emissions management)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SBTi<|><|>organization<|>The Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) is an organization that validates and supports companies' commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in line with climate science)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WEIR GROUP<|>SBTi<|>Weir Group submitted its emissions reduction targets to the SBTi for validation<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WEIR GROUP<|>CLIMATE CHANGE<|>The company aims to address climate change by reducing its emissions and promoting sustainable solutions<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WEIR GROUP<|>SCOPE 3 EMISSIONS<|>The majority of Weir Group's carbon footprint is attributable to downstream customer site use<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WEIR GROUP<|>SCOPE 1&2 EMISSIONS<|>The company reports and monitors its own direct emissions from operations<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WEIR GROUP<|>SCOPE 4<|>Scope 4 refers to avoided emissions through energy-efficient technologies adopted by customers<|>4)\n##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
