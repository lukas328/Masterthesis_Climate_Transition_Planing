The going \nconcern assessment in Note 1: Basis of Preparation \non page 126 includes information on the Directorsâ€™ \ndetailed assessment of the Groupâ€™s status as a \ngoing concern. \nLonger-term viability \nOur Directors have examined the outlook for the \nCompany and the Group as required by provision 31 \nof the Code, assessing our ability to operate and meet \nour liabilities as they fall due over a three-year period. \nOur 3x6 strategy introduced in 2021 is the driving \nforce behind our transformation agenda and planning \nprocess. We chose a three-year assessment period for \nthe longer-term viability assessment because it ties \nin with our internal planning process. Our planning \nconsiders all important financial and regulatory \nmeasures over the period and stresses the key risks \nfacing individual Business Units, as well as global risks \nthat could impact Bupa as a whole. We considered a \nnumber of reasonably plausible severe scenarios as well \nas contingent liabilities. This included a broad range of \npotential adverse outcomes from the Chile Supreme \nCourt judgment described on page 11, including \nscenarios that considered materially worse outcomes \nthan the Solvency II capital allocated against the \ncontingency given the inherent uncertainty surrounding \nthe implementation of the Supreme Court judgement. \nOther scenarios considered included a group-wide \nassessment of a worsening of the global inflationary \noutlook driven by strong wage inflation leading to a \nwage-price inflation spiral and subsequent recession, \nand a variety of local scenarios developed by each \nBusiness Unit with the majority focusing on strategic \nworkforce-related risks impacting either the availability \nor cost of staff. This process shows the Group remains \nrobust over the current three-year plan period, even \nunder the stressed scenarios examined. \nWe also conduct â€˜reverse stress testingâ€™ at the Group \nlevel which aims to identify hypothetical circumstances \nthat might result in our business model failing and helps \nour Directors to better understand the Groupâ€™s risks. \nThe Group remains most exposed to failure through a \nlack of liquidity at the Group centre although multiple \nimprobable events are required to induce failure before \nmanagement actions in the timeframe considered. \nAs part of their assessment of our viability, the \nDirectors looked at our financial performance, capital \nmanagement, cash flow, solvency and future outlook. \nBupa is well capitalised and is expected to remain so \nover the plan period. The liquidity position of the Group \nis expected to remain strong across the three-year \nperiod. The forecast assumes that the remaining Â£250m \nportion of the subordinated bond maturing in 2023 is \nrepaid from available liquidity. The forecast also \nassumes that a Â£300m senior bond maturing in 2024 \nis refinanced with a similar instrument upon or before \nmaturity. While this provides some uncertainty, Bupaâ€™s \nstrong ratings and proven access to bond markets \nprovide considerable comfort. Under the most severe \neconomic scenarios considered as part of our stress \ntesting, the forecast liquidity position reduces and \nfurther management actions would be required to \nremain within the Groupâ€™s liquidity appetite by 2024. \nManagement actions include reducing expenditure, \nobtaining additional funding or divesting investments \nor businesses. \nBupa Annual Report 2022 98 \n      \n       \n      \n        \n          \n         \nÂ          \n          \n       \n         \n        \n       \n   \n         \nÂ         \nÂ          \n       \n      \n         \nÂ             \n        \n       \n        \n         \nÂ          \n     \n      \n      \n        \n       \n         \n       \n          \n      \n        \nÂ  Â   \n          \n       \n         \n         \n       \nÂ   \n    \n        \n        \n      \n       \n        \n        \n          \n      \n     \nÂ      \n         \n        \n             \n          \n          \n      \nÂ    \n       \n  \n       \n   \n       \n    \n  \n       \nÂ       \n        \n          \n         \n     \n       \n        \n       \n        \n         \n         \n         \n        \n       \n         \n        \n        \nÂ  Â          \nÂ \n        \n         \n      \n        \nÂ       \n       \nÂ        \n        \n       \n          \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n \n â€ƒ â€ƒ â€ƒ â€ƒ  \n   \n   \nStrategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements \nOther statutory information continued \nOur most recent ORSA, which brings together \nthe outcomes of risk management and financial \nmanagement processes, considers the level of \nregulatory capital we require to remain financially stable \nover the planning period given the nature of the risks \nwe currently face, our strategy and our risk appetite. \nIt takes into account the quantification of the Groupâ€™s \ncurrent risks as defined by the Solvency II Directive and \nconsiders the impact of potential stressed scenarios \nwhich are aligned with our risk profile. This assessment \nconcluded that we expect to have sufficient capital \nassets to continue to meet regulatory requirements \nover a three-year period. \nAlthough Bupa pays interest on its borrowings, it has \nno shareholders and there are therefore no dividends \nto pay. Instead, we can invest in growing organically \nand through acquisition. This expenditure is largely \ndiscretionary and can be reduced if required. \nFollowing a review of the key risks and uncertainties \nset out in the Risk section on pages 42 to 48, the \nDirectors are satisfied that we have appropriate risk \nmanagement and governance procedures in place to \nmanage and mitigate these risks over the three-year \nperiod. We also identify and report on emerging risks \nto ensure that they are properly understood and are \nconsidered in our future strategic decisions. \nThe Directorsâ€™ assessment considered both current \nexpectations, and reasonably plausible severe scenarios, \nincluding those arising from the potential impacts of \nsignificant global economic uncertainty on the Group. \nWhile continuing uncertainty exists as a result of\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BUPA<|><organization<|>Bupa is a healthcare group that provides health insurance, care services, and related activities.
