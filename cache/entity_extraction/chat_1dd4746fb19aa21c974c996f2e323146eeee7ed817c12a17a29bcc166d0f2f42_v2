Refer to section 5.2 for details on EPC data sourcing and limitations. Where \nEPC data is not available, a scaling factor is applied to estimate absolute emissions and floor space. We have assumed \nthat the population for which EPC data has not been obtained is reflective of the population where such data was \navailable.\n • EPC data has not been adjusted for any assumed energy efficiency changes to the property since the date of \ninspection. For Scope 2 absolute emissions estimates, EPC data has been adjusted only for the decarbonisation of the \nUK power grid between the year of inspection and date of estimation of financed emissions.\nOriginal LTVs have been calculated based on outstanding loan balance at the calculation date, divided by original \nproperty values at the time of mortgage origination.\nWe have used the IEA ETP B2DS World pathway to estimate the physical emissions intensity reduction of 49% required \nby 2030, as validated by the SBTi as science-based.\nCRE\nAmounts analysed of £15.6 billion at 31 December 2021 (31 December 2019 £17.7 billion) include lending for the \npurchase, refinance and development of commercial real estate. Since 2019, absolute emissions have decreased by 22% \nreflecting the decrease in lending balance.\nTo estimate financed emissions, we used both EPC ratings and property values. Financed emissions reflect Scope 1 and 2 \nemissions related to the energy use of buildings financed, during their operation (energy consumed by the property’s \noccupants and shared facilities).\n • We use EPC data to estimate emissions for CRE lending, aligned with the methodology used for residential mortgages.\n • Domestic EPCs are adjusted to reflect improvements in the electricity grid since the date of EPC inspection. \nFor properties where the EPC inspection date has not been obtained (non-domestic), the adjustment is applied for the \naverage change in emissions intensity in the ten years prior to the reporting year.\n • Where EPC data is not available, emissions are estimated using average emissions based on property type and region \nfrom properties for which EPCs are available. This assumes that the population for which EPC data is available is \nreflective of the population where such data was not available.\n • In cases where multiple properties are secured by lending facilities, to estimate financed emissions at a property level, \nwe apportioned loan values to underlying properties so emissions can be assessed based on EPC ratings of underlying \nproperties.\n • To calculate the attribution factor for our share of each property’s emissions, we have used property valuation at \norigination in line with the PCAF Standard.\nWe used the UK CCC BNZ scenario to create a decarbonisation trajectory for this sector, estimating that the physical \nemission intensity of our CRE loans and investment portfolio needs to reduce by 60% by 2030, as validated by the SBTi as \nscience-based.
