There were more than a few discrepanci es between the company/project reported data \n(score 1 or 2) and estimated data (score 4 or 5). Accurately assessing the real situation will require using more precise data. \n \nWhile taking into account our priorities in line with our goals for measuring financed emissions, we will pursue greater \nimprovements in the quality of data by utilizing more external data, communicating with vendors, and undertaking engagement \nwith clients and related stakeholders in regard to their disclosures of emissions. \n \nc. Development of an efficient measurement process \nThroughout FY2021, relevant departments within the Mizuho group coordinated on the measurement project in a trial -and-error \nprocess. Given that measurement standards and data have yet to fully develop, this effort proved to be labor intensive. \n \nThrough our activities as a member of the PCAF Japan coalition, we are working to deepen discussions and resolve issues by \nsharing with other financial institutions the insights and experience we have gained from addressing practical challenges and by \ntaking part in developing a framework for efficiently collecting accurate emissions data. In addition, we are looking into developing \nour internal framework for ensuring efficient measurement utilizing technology and other means. \n \nd. Our clients’ approaches to Scope 3 emissions \nBoth financial institutions and client companies have only just begun to measure and disclose Scope 3 emissions (categories 1  \nto 15) and will be gradually strengthening their initiatives going forward. Furt her, the PCAF database does not currently include \ndata (emission factors) for estimating downstream Scope 3 emissions in each sector, and because of this our financed emissions \nvalues may change significantly in the future. Moreover, the definitions of Scope 1, 2, and 3 can lead to multiple companies double \ncounting the same emissions, with the PCAF Standard stating, “Double counting occurs between the different scopes of emissions \nfrom loans and investments when a financial institution invests in stakeholders that are in the same value chain. This form of \ndouble counting cannot be avoided but can be made more transparent by separately reporting the scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions of \nloans and investments.”24 \n \nIn light of the above, we believe becoming able to monitor our clients ’ overall Scope 3 emissions and trends within our financed \nemissions will take more time. We will continue our efforts to improve measurement. \n                                         \n24 PCAF, The Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the Financial Industry, p. 101, Box 6. \nCEO message\nOverview/Introduction\nGovernance\nStrategy\nRisk management\nMetrics and targets\nConclusion\nAppendix\n \n-66- Mizuho Financial Group \n \n \nPCAF and PCAF Japan initiatives \nThe Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) is an international initiative that \ndevelops and implements open-source methodologies to measure the GHG emissions of \nfinancial institutions’ lending and investment portfolios. As of May 2022, over 260 financial \ninstitutions have joined PCAF, including commercial banks, investment banks, insurance \ncompanies, and institutional investors, representing a total of more than USD 73 trillion in \nfinancial assets. \n \nNovember 2021 saw the launch of the PCAF Japan coalition for PCAF member institutions \nin Japan, and as of May 2022 18 financial institutions are taking part. \n \nMizuho Financial Group joined PCAF in July 2021, becoming the first Japanese financial institution to do so. In comparison \nto the previous fiscal year, we have undertaken measurement acr oss a wider range of assets and sectors while utilizing \nPCAF’s insights and emission factors database and taking a trial-and-error approach. \n \nIn exploring the estimation of GHG emissions and methods for utilizing such data, we have come across several prac tical \nchallenges. These include interpretation of industry types according to Japanese standards, insufficient GHG emission and \nother data from financed entities, a need for efficient data collection methods, and duplicated emissions counting at various \nlevels. \n \nTo overcome these challenges, it is important that we further strengthen collaboration with our various stakeholders, including \ncollaboration in the financial sector. One step we took towards this goal was to contribute to organizing the PCAF Japan \ncoalition as the first PCAF member institution from Japan and to serve as chair of the coalition at the time of its launch in \nNovember 2021. \n \nAfter discussion among the participating institutions, the PCAF Japan coalition has established and announced an FY2022 \nworkplan. We are advancing collaboration and the sharing of experience, knowledge, and issues among participating \nfinancial institutions to promote enhancement of the measurement and disclosure of GHG emissions from loans and \ninvestments (financed emissions), while also strengthening stakeholder collaboration toward solving common issues. \n \n\n  \nTCFD Report 2022  -67- \n \n4. Scope 3 (GHG emissions from financing and investment) target setting \n(1) Electric power sector mid-term target setting \nDescribed in detail in 4.2. Achieving net zero (page 23). \n \n(2) Sectors planned for target setting going forward \nIn order to pursue efforts to limit the rise in global average temperature to 1.5°C, we have a long-term goal of achieving net -zero \nGHG emissions from our financing and investment  by 2050. To make the pathway to reaching this goal more tangible, we are \npressing forward with setting mid-term targets (to be reached by FY2030). \n \nWe have already set a mid-term target for the electric power sector. We will account for the sectors stipul ated by the NZBA, \ntransition risk evaluations, financed emissions, and feasibility and set further targets one-by-one, beginning from key areas. \n \n \n \n  \n FY2022: Electric power sector\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
