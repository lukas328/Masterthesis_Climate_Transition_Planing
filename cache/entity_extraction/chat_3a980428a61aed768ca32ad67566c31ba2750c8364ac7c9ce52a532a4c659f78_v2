This includes an independent third-\nparty hotline for employees who wish to raise \nissues anonymously.\nEquality Policy\nThe Equality Policy codifies Ninety One’s zero \ntolerance approach to unlawful discrimination, \nharassment, less favourable treatment or \nvictimisation of any employee, job applicant, client \nor service provider and sets out the procedure for \nformally and informally raising issues.\nDiversity and belonging \nTrue to our heritage, Ninety One is committed to creating an environment rich \nin diversity; where our demographics increasingly reflect society and our client \nbase; where all people feel welcome and respected; and where everyone has a \nfair opportunity to develop and contribute. \nIn order to achieve change that is meaningful and sustainable, we do not \napproach diversity in isolation but rather within the context of our culture.  \nAs noted above, our core cultural tenants of ‘do the right thing’ and ‘freedom \nto create’ are our source of differentiation and competitive advantage. \nFundamentally, we believe that the path to diversity and inclusion is freedom – \nto express individuality, pursue opportunities and maximise potential. We are \ncommitted to creating an environment in which all people have these freedoms. \nAt the same time, we do not assume a level playing field and recognise that \nsimply providing freedom does not ensure diversity or transformation. Our \napproach places a responsibility on the firm and the individual: both have \na role to play in achieving transformation and enforcing our zero-tolerance \nof prejudice, discrimination or any form of unfair treatment. Diversity and \ninclusion is a collective responsibility that requires continuous effort from \nall of us. \nOur aim is to ensure people of different backgrounds, cultures, beliefs \nand perspectives feel comfortable and welcome at Ninety One. We are \nproud of the culture we have fostered over time, which not only tolerates \ndifferences but appreciates and extracts value from them. We believe that \nour culture is at the cutting edge of balancing freedom and expression of \nindividuality with an overarching sense of belonging and common purpose \n– these are building blocks which afford our people the opportunity to build \nsuccessful careers and thrive in a collaborative work environment. This, in \nturn, leads to better results and outcomes for our clients. \nSustainability and Stewardship Report\n64\nCreating a diverse and inclusive workplace is an evolving process and takes \ntime.
