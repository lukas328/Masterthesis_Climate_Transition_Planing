Changes to the global economy to support the low-carbon \ntransition will require enormous global cooperation, and we plan to continue sharing our tools and lessons \nlearned that accelerate our collective progress on our path to decarbonization.\nThe transition to a low-carbon society will not be smooth or perfectly linear , especially in light of the global \neconomic disruptions of 2022, which we expect will continue into 2023 and beyond. However , as the world’s \nmost global bank, we strive to leverage the full power of our business and to act with urgency to help \naddress the risks posed by climate change while ensuring a just, fair and inclusive low-carbon transition.\n \nLooking Forward \n \nPART 6\nTCFD REPORT 2022: CITI’S APPROACH TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND NET ZERO | 65\nForward-Looking Statements   \nThe disclosures included in this report are being provided in an effort to align with the TCFD \nrecommendations and GFANZ guidance, respond to investor and other stakeholder requests, and further \nenhance our collective understanding of how climate risk translates into Citi’s key risk categories. As \ndiscussed above, our approaches to the disclosures included in this report differ in certain significant \nways from those included in our required disclosures, including those mandated by SEC rules and \nregulations. For additional information, see “A Brief Note on Materiality” in the Introduction section.   \nCertain statements in this report are “forward-looking statements,” including, but not limited to, those \nstatements regarding our operational and financed net-zero targets, sustainable and transition finance \ngoals, and related goals, commitments, strategies and plans. In addition, we may make forward-looking \nstatements in other publicly available documents, and our management may make forward-looking \nstatements orally to analysts, investors, representatives of the media and others. Generally, forward-\nlooking statements are not based on historical facts, but instead represent our and our management’s \ncurrent beliefs regarding future events. Such statements may be identified by words such as believe, \nexpect, anticipate, intend, aim, estimate, continue, project, may increase, may fluctuate, target, illustrative, \nplans and similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as will, should, would, may or could. \nHowever , any statement that is not a statement of historical fact, regardless of whether it uses any of the \nforegoing words, is a forward-looking statement.\nForward-looking statements are based on management’s current expectations and are subject to risks, \nuncertainties, changes in circumstances and assumptions that are difficult to predict and are often \nbeyond our control and inherently uncertain. These statements are not guarantees of future results, \noccurrences, performance or condition, and actual results may differ materially from those included \nin this report. Moreover , many of the forward-looking statements included in this report are based on \nassumptions, standards, metrics, measurements, methodologies, data and internal frameworks believed \nto be reasonable at the time of preparation, but should not be considered guarantees. In particular , \nassumptions, standards, metrics, methodologies and frameworks for measurement, reporting and analysis \nof climate change continue to evolve, vary across jurisdictions and regulatory bodies and are the subject \nof proposed regulatory changes in multiple jurisdictions, which may have a material impact on our future \nmeasurement and reporting, as well as the results of the efforts set forth in this report. Furthermore, \nour ability to measure many of these goals is dependent on data expected to be measured, tracked and \nprovided by our clients and other stakeholders; as a result, our ability to measure progress and meet our \ntargets is subject to the quality and availability of such data, as discussed in this report. Given the inherent \nuncertainty of the estimates, assumptions and timelines contained in this report, we may not be able to \nanticipate whether or the degree to which we will be able to meet our plans, targets, goals or commitments \nin advance. Further , Citi has not, and does not intend to, independently verify third-party data. Actual \nresults, performance or outcomes may differ materially from those expressed in or implied by any of these \nforward-looking statements due to a variety of factors, including, among others, global socio-demographic \nand economic trends, geopolitical challenges and uncertainties, financial results, energy prices, consumer \nand client behavior , technological innovations, climate-related conditions and weather events, pandemics, \nlegislative and regulatory changes, the outcome of current and future legal proceedings and regulatory \n66 | TCFD REPORT 2022: CITI’S APPROACH TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND NET ZERO\ninvestigations, public policies, engagement with clients, suppliers, investors, government officials and \nother stakeholders, our ability to gather and verify data regarding environmental impacts, our ability \nto successfully implement various initiatives throughout the company under expected time frames, the \ncompliance of various third parties with our policies and procedures and legal requirements and other \nunforeseen events\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CITI<|>organization<|>Citi is a global bank actively engaged in climate efforts, focusing on decarbonization, climate risk management, and sustainable finance initiatives)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TCFD<|>organization<|>Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) provides recommendations for climate-related financial reporting, which Citi aligns with in its disclosures)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GFANZ<|>organization<|>The Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) provides guidance for financial institutions to achieve net-zero targets, which Citi references in its climate strategy)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEC<|>organization<|>U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which is considering regulations that impact climate-related disclosures and reporting standards for companies like Citi)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Aurelia<|>geo<|>Fictional country mentioned in previous examples;
