In response to a heightened level of information \nsecurity incidents within the healthcare sector around \nthe world, management continues to take action to \nfurther strengthen controls in certain areas, including \nthe Group’s cyber-attack response capabilities, and has \nreported to the Committee on this. The Committee has \nalso discussed the risks of moving systems and data to \ncloud providers, noting that a safe migration to the \ncloud could enhance Bupa’s operational resilience. \nClinical risk \nDuring 2022, the Committee has increased its focus on \nclinical risk and clinical governance and has overseen \nthe strengthening of clinical governance across the \nGroup. As part of this, the Clinical Governance Function \nhas moved from the leadership of the CMO to the CRO. \nThe Committee has considered the impact of regulatory \nchanges and the challenges in the recruitment and \nretention of a high-quality clinical workforce, \nparticularly in Australia, and also received updates from \nmanagement on the progress made in evidencing the \nquality of clinical services received by the Group’s \ninsurance customers from third party providers. \nSustainability, environment and climate \nchange risks \nThe Committee considered the key risks and related \nmitigants associated with Bupa’s sustainability strategy. \nThese include failing to achieve the sustainability \nstrategy, diluting our sustainability ambitions over \ntime and not keeping pace with our peers or the rising \nexpectations of our key stakeholders. The Committee \ndiscussed the need for a high level of credibility \nunderpinning the information and statements published \non Bupa’s sustainability activities in order to avoid an \nadverse impact on Bupa’s reputation. The Committee \nhas also considered the risks to achieving Bupa’s \ncarbon-neutral targets arising from the current \neconomic environment, which could drive up the costs \nof achieving those targets. In relation to climate change, \nthe Committee reviewed an assessment of the key risks \nto the Group and the results of a further climate change \nscenario stress test. \nRecovery and Resolution Plans \nThe PRA requires internationally active insurance \ngroups to put in place Recovery and Resolution Plans \nat holding company level to set out potential actions \nthe Company could take to maintain or recover the \nGroup’s solvency in an extreme stress scenario that \nthreatens the Group’s ongoing viability (Recovery Plan) \nor, if necessary, the steps that the Group could take to \nresolve itself in a crisis in an orderly fashion (Resolution \nPlan). These Plans aim to protect customers as much as \npossible in the event that the Company were to face \nan extreme stress scenario. \nThe Risk Committee considered the draft Plans in detail \nahead of recommending them to the Board for approval \nand submission to the PRA. Management held regular \nmeetings with the PRA to discuss the key judgements \ninvolved in preparing the Plans. Throughout the \nprocess, the Committee: \n▪ challenged management on the feasibility of the \nrecovery options presented within the suggested \ntimescale \n▪ reviewed the governance process around the \ndrafting of the Plans \n▪ reviewed the early warning indicators and \nrecovery triggers \n▪ reviewed the governance process that would be \nfollowed to oversee the implementation of the Plans. \nThese Plans will continue to be developed based on \nfeedback from the PRA and changes to the business \nover time. \nEmerging risks \nThe Committee regularly monitors emerging risks and \nspecifically considered clinical emerging risk areas \nthat could impact achievement of the Group’s 3x6 \nstrategy. These included the impact of evolving \ndigital technologies, the use of artificial intelligence \nin medicine and genomics. The Committee discussed \nwith management how the legal, regulatory and ethical \nissues associated with each of these risks would be \naddressed. The Committee has monitored the potential \nrisks to the business from rising inflation and has \nconsidered the actions management are taking \nto mitigate its impact. \nConsideration of other emerging risks has focused \non\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BUPA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Bupa is a healthcare company that provides health insurance, aged care services, dental services, and other health-related activities globally.
