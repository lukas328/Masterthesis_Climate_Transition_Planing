Australia continued to experience \nongoing disruption to the supply of local health provision during the year. From 1 October 2022, the provision \nclosed to future accrual of deferred claims as the health provision restrictions no longer applied. \nThe estimated cost of claims expected to rebound after the reporting date has been calculated as a proportion \n(the deferral rate) of the observed shortfall in incurred claims across the period of disruption, compared with \npre-COVID-19 expectations. As at 31 December 2022, the estimated amount represents 55% of the shortfall in \nhospitalisation claims in the period since 1 January 2022, compared with expected claims. This has been recognised \non a best estimate basis, together with an allowance for claims handling costs and an additional risk margin. \nRelated future claims experience may differ significantly from these estimates. \nBupa Annual Report 2022 175 \n                 \n                     \n     \n \n  \n               \n              \n \n               \n              \n            \n            \n                          \n         \n       \n \n               \n                \n                \n             \n                \n                 \n                \n                \n               \n             \n               \n        \n      \n \n               \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n             \n               \n          \n      \n   \nStrategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements \nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \ncontinued \nThe key assumption in determining the deferred claims is the assumed deferral rate.
