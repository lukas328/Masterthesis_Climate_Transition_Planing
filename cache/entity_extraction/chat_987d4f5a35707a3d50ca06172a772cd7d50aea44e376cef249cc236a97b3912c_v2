The \nevaluation report indicated that the Committee was \nworking well, in particular due to its clarity of role \nand attention to the priorities. The report has assisted \nin identifying priorities for 2023, in particular the \nintended focus on information security risks. \nThe 2021 internal review of the Committeeâ€™s \neffectiveness concluded that the Committee was \noperating effectively. The Committee identified a \nnumber of areas to focus on in 2022 as a result of \ndiscussion of the 2021 internal review as follows: \nâ–ª The impact of the 3x6 strategy on the Groupâ€™s \nrisk profile \nâ–ª Climate change risks to our health insurance and \nprovision businesses and how management are \naddressing these \nâ–ª Further strengthening clinical risk management \nâ–ª Continuing our work on risk management maturity. \nThe Committee is satisfied that these areas have \nreceived sufficient oversight during the year as \ndisclosed above. \nFocus for 2023 \nIn 2023, the Committee will focus on: \nâ–ª People risks \nâ–ª Information security, IT and operational resilience \nrisks, including the potential crossover with \nreputational risk and contagion risk \nâ–ª Clinical governance and reporting \nâ–ª Third-party risks \nâ–ª Further refining the Groupâ€™s Recovery and \nResolution Plans \nâ–ª Maintaining oversight of the implementation of the \nIMS project across the Group. \nCaroline Silver \nRisk Committee Chair \nBupa Annual Report 2022 75 \n    \n        \n        \nÂ         \n     \n         \n        \n           \n          \n        \n       \n       \n Â          \nÂ  Â \n       \n       \n      \n        \nÂ         \n      \n       \n       \n           \nÂ       \n       \n        \n       \n      \n         \nÂ    \n   \n  \n         \n         \n         \nÂ        \n      \nÂ       \nÂ        \nÂ     \n        \n       \n        \n         \n          \n       \n        \n         \n        \nÂ            \n       \nÂ         \n         \n        \nÂ       \n        \n       \n         \nÂ     \n         \n        \n           \n         \n        \n        \n        \n    \n           \nÂ          \n         \n        \n         \n          \n          \nÂ           \n         \n        \n        \n          \n          \n        \n         \n       \n \n         \n        \n        \n       \n       \n       \n  \n  \n         \n         \n        \n          \n          \n     \nÂ           \n         \nÂ         \nÂ         \n \n â€ƒ â€ƒ â€ƒ â€ƒ  \n    \n   \nStrategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements \nNomination & Governance Committee report \nThe Committeeâ€™s role and governance \nThe Committee is responsible for reviewing the size, \nstructure and composition of the Board and ensuring \nan orderly succession process for Directors. It also \nkeeps Bupaâ€™s corporate governance arrangements \nunder review. It leads the process for appointments to \nthe Board and considers succession planning to ensure \nthat the Board has the skills and expertise it needs to \nlead and manage the Company in the future. The Board \nDiversity Policy, available here on bupa.com, is taken \ninto account when considering Board succession plans \nand recruiting for new Directors. Succession planning \nfor the senior management team is done by the Board \nas a whole. \nThe Committee makes recommendations to the Board \nto ensure that, where appropriate, Bupaâ€™s corporate \ngovernance arrangements are consistent with best \npractice. The Committee also leads the process for \nthe selection and appointment of AMs, approves the \nappointment of non-executive directors to subsidiary \nboards and approves the appointment of independent \nmembers of Market Unit advisory oversight committees. \nA full description of the Committeeâ€™s role is set out in \nits Terms of Reference here on bupa.com. \nThe Committee currently comprises the Chairman and \nthree independent NEDs, including the SID. The Group \nCEO and Chief Sustainability and People Officer \nregularly attend Committee meetings. The Committee \nmet five times during the year and agreed other \nmatters by written resolution. \nKey activities in 2022 \nNon-Executive Director recruitment \nAs disclosed in the Committeeâ€™s report last year, Korn \nFerry was engaged in September 2021 to assist the \nBoard in the recruitment of three NEDs to replace \nthose who were retiring from the Board. \nThe Committee was seeking candidates with \nexpertise in technology and digital transformation, \nand sustainability, with a preference for female \nand ethnically diverse candidates. \nSix candidates were shortlisted for each of the \ntechnology and sustainability roles and the Chief \nSustainability and People Officer and I interviewed each \ncandidate in late 2021. The two preferred candidates for \neach role were then interviewed by the Group CEO and \nmembers of the Committee and the technology \ncandidates were also interviewed by Cath Keers. As \nnoted in the Committeeâ€™s report in the 2021 Annual \nReport, Pia Heidenmark Cook was appointed as a \nNED from 1 April 2022, bringing a strong skill set in \nsustainability matters to the Board. The Committee \nheld an additional meeting to discuss the technology \ncandidates who were considered to be of high calibre. \nThe Committee felt that Gunjan Bhowâ€™s broad skill \nset and experience in customer-facing digital \ntransformation would enable him to make a strong \ncontribution to the Board and recommended his \nappointment to the Board. He was appointed as a \nNED from 1 April 2022. \nA third NED with a financial services background was \nsought to replace Clare Thompson, who retired from \nthe Board on 30 April 2022. Korn Ferry drew up an all-\nfemale long list of candidates\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
