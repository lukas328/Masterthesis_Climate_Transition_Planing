The Board has also \nbeen considering the impacts for customers, providers, employees, \nlocal regulatory relationships, and the Group’s and the local brand \nand reputation as part of its Group-level oversight of Bupa Chile’s \ndeveloping strategy. \nLong-term impact \nThe Board continues to monitor the long-term viability of Cruz Blanca \nand has considered a broad range of potential adverse outcomes \nfrom the Chile Supreme Court judgment described on page 11 in its \nassessment of the Company’s and the Group’s longer-term viability, \nas described on page 98. \nFinancial Review \non page 9 \nAudit Committee \nReport on page 67 \nResponse to the war in Ukraine \nPeople, communities and the environment, customers \nIssue Action and progress Further information \nThe war in Ukraine broke out \nin February 2022, driving \nmillions of refugees to \nneighbouring countries, \nincluding Poland. The refugees \nwere in need of healthcare \nfacilities and continuing \nsupport. The Group had to \nconsider its commercial \nresponse to Russia's unlawful \ninvasion of Ukraine. \nAction \nLUX MED, our Polish business, acted swiftly following the outbreak of \nwar in Ukraine by providing free emergency and ongoing medical care \nin partnership with the Polish authorities. LUX MED has also employed \nmany Ukrainian healthcare workers fleeing the conflict, enabling them \nto continue their work. The Board wholly supports the actions taken \nand Bupa is funding this support for as long as needed. The Chairman, \nGroup CEO and other executives visited Poland during the year to \nsee this work first-hand and were impressed with the speed at which \nservices had been provided and the dedication of our people to support \nthose fleeing the conflict. \nShortly after the invasion, the Board also decided that, in addition to \ncomplying with applicable sanctions, Bupa would end any existing \nrelationships as soon as possible, and would not renew existing contracts \nwith businesses in Russia or Russian-controlled entities globally. The Risk \nCommittee has also received reports on the Group’s compliance with \nsanctions imposed on doing business with Russia or Russian nationals. \nStakeholder considerations \nThe Board and LUX MED management felt that this was the right thing \nto do in a humanitarian crisis and in line with Bupa's purpose and values. \nThe ongoing costs and focus of our services have been managed alongside \nour teams continuing to support our existing customers in Poland without \ncompromising the service we provide. This demonstrates the flexibility \nBupa has to invest where it is most needed as it is not under pressure \nto continually fund dividends to external shareholders. \nDespite the impact on customers in Russia and employees of Russian-\ncontrolled entities, many of whom may not support the war, the Board \nconcluded that Bupa's purpose, values and reputation would be best \nserved by ceasing to do business with Russia. \nLong-term impact \nBupa intends to continue to support LUX MED to fund medical care \nfor Ukrainian refugees for as long as it is needed. \nSustainability and \nESG section on \npage 35 \nBupa Annual Report 2022 41 \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n         \n     \n          \n        \n        \n         \n        \n   \n     \n        \n          \n          \n         \n       \n         \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n       \n         \n            \n      \n         \n         \n    \n           \n        \n         \n         \n          \n         \n  \n     \n    \n    \n     \n   \n        \n        \n     \n  \n        \n       \n      \n           \n          \n    \n         \n          \n        \n       \n         \n       \n        \n \n       \n         \n        \n       \n        \n    \n        \n         \n          \n  \n        \n      \n       \n       \n  \n       \n       \n          \n      \n         \n   \n       \n  \n        \n    \n       \n          \n     \n       \n        \n     \n      \n     \n          \n   \nStrategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements \nRisk \nEmbedding a strong risk \nmanagement culture is a \npriority across Bupa supported \nby robust risk management \nand controls. \nThis focus on culture is essential in order to respond \nto changing environments and evolving regulation. \nThis means we can foresee the potential risks of future \nchanges that could affect our customers and our \nbusiness, and to mitigate them.
