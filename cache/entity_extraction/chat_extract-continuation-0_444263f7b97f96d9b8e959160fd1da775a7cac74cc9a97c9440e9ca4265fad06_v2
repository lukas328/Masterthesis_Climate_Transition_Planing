We \nreceive the contracted cash fee which is set with reference to market price at the start of the \ncontract. Upon delivery of the refined metal to the customer, the percentage of the refined \nmetal that we may retain at settlement is considered to be a non-cash consideration and is \nrecognised as part of revenue at fair value.  \nRevenue from refining services is recognised using an output method by estimating the \nprogress of the metal in the refining process. Once the customer metal is in the refining \nprocess it is commingled with metal from other customers and it is not separately identifiable. \nBecause we have a consistent volume of metal flowing through the refinery process, we \nestimate that all of the metal in the refinery is on average 50% of the way through the \nprocess. We therefore recognise up to 50% of the revenue (cash service fee and non-cash \nconsideration) for our services when metal enters the refining process. Since refining each \ntype of metal is a separate performance obligation, once we have returned the metal to the \ncustomer, we recognise the remaining 50% of revenue for that particular metal while other \nmetal may still be due to the same customer. \nWhere refinery stocktakes indicate that metal recoveries have been lower than anticipated \nand/or allowed for in process loss provisioning, refined metal gain revenue is reduced \naccordingly.
