Take a look at the \nhighlights per division:\nAsia: there was downturn in net revenue, \nexplained by lower export volumes to \nChina and an appreciation of the Brazilian \nreal, partially mitigated by higher prices \nof chicken meat for Japan, South Korea \nand China. The preparation of new plants \nfor exportation is one of our response \nmeasures: we were awarded 6 new plant \napprovals for Singapore, Japan and China in \n2022.\nHalal: the DDP Halal segment saw \ngrowth supported by the Adjusted Ebitda, \ninfluenced by a net operating revenue \nhigher than the previous year . In this regard, \nwe increased the volume of sales to the \nregion, increased our share of products \nwith aggregate value, and improved our \nprice performance in the region, with \nfluctuations in the supply of local chicken \nmeat. In Turkey, we continued to face \na very challenging scenario involving \nhyperinflation, in which in 12 months \naccumulated inflation reached 64.27%.
