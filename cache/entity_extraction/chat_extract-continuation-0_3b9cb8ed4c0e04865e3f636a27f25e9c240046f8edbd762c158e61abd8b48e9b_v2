Assessments such as \nthese are integral to Citi’s continued climate risk identification efforts.\nClimate Risk Assessments    \nTo help Citi understand the climate risk profiles of our individual corporate clients, we have created a tool \ncalled the Climate Risk Assessment & Scorecard (CRAS). Our goal is to progressively embed this tool into \nour risk management processes to help inform our decision-making moving forward.\nThe CRAS was designed to identify the most material climate risks our clients face and the management \nplans in place for adaptation and mitigation of those risks, using both quantitative and qualitative inputs. \nThe tool assesses clients’ vulnerability to climate risk, the feasibility of their plans to transition to a low-\ncarbon environment and the quality of their governance and disclosure. It relies on information disclosed \nby clients, either publicly or privately, as well as output from third-party tools, our own sector heat maps \nand certain climate risk metrics. Points are attributed based on vulnerability and mitigation considerations \nas well as alignment with best practices, and are aggregated into a final climate score. This final score \ncaptures a company’s degree of vulnerability from climate-related financial risks and the extent of a \ncompany’s preparedness to mitigate these risks through its strategy, governance and disclosures.\nThe development of the CRAS has been a joint effort between Risk Management and BCMA and has been \nan iterative process. We have successfully completed pilot programs using the CRAS, focusing on clients in \nthe corporate sectors deemed most vulnerable according to our heat maps. We plan to expand the scope to \nadditional clients and sectors as we integrate results into underwriting processes.\nResults from the CRAS also serve as inputs into the Net Zero Review Template, which Citi is piloting to help \nprioritize engagement with a particular focus on transition opportunities for clients. For more details on \nthe Net Zero Review Template, please see page 30.\n \n42 | TCFD REPORT 2022: CITI’S APPROACH TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND NET ZERO\nEnvironmental and Social Risk Management Policy    \nIntegrating climate risk into our policies and sector standards provides the foundation to consistently \nidentify and manage climate-related risks throughout the enterprise. Since 2015, our ESRM Policy has \naddressed the increasing credit risk, stranded asset risk and reputation risk related to declining demand \nfor thermal coal mining and coal-fired power . In addition, our early 2023 updates to address the climate-\nrelated impacts from deforestation in the agribusiness sector are discussed in the Biodiversity section of \nthis Report. \nCoal Policy   \nOur ESRM Policy commitments related to coal-fired power generation have been updated over time as \nthe credit and reputational risk related to coal has increased. We have committed not to finance any new \ncoal-fired power plants or expansions of existing plants globally, in line with existing regulations in many \ncountries such as the U.S., which have prevented new coal-fired capacity being built for many years. \nWe have reviewed our coal-fired power clients’ GHG reporting and low-carbon transition plans, including \ncommitments to retire existing coal plants. Our analysis considered a combination of client disclosures, \nthird-party ESG analysis, CDP disclosures and direct client engagement. This evaluation will continue into \nour net zero engagement and progress towards our 2030 targets.
