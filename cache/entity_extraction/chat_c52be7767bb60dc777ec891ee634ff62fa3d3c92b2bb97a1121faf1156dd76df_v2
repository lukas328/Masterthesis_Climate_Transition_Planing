Some partnerships established by the bank have been proving to be potential catalyzers for the reduction of financed emissions. \nTwo relevant alliances in this respect are the programs Reverte (Reverse), in partnership with Syngenta and TNC, and Pro Carbono (Pro Carbon) of Bayer. The bank’s work in each program is \ndifferent but in both the final goal is to encourage and strengthen initiatives that promote the engagement of rural producers in less emission-intensive production models. \nPro Carbono (Pro Carbon) program\nWe support Bayer in the development of the Pro Carbono (Pro Carbon) program. as part of Bayer’s global \nstrategy for its climate targets, the program encourages the adoption of sustainable practices in Brazilian rural \nareas and encourages the creation of economically attractive models for carbon sequestration. The producers \nengaged in the program test the adoption of a package of production techniques that tend to increase \nthe retention of carbon in the soil and, as a result, reduce the system’s emissions. These producers access \nadvantageous commercial conditions with both the bank and other partners of the program. The initiative also \nhas the partnership of research institutions such as Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (Embrapa) and \nsome universities for facing challenges such as the technical and scientific barriers of carbon in agriculture, in \nparticular the need to develop carbon measurement methodologies that are accessible, scalable, with viable \ncosts and accepted by the foreign markets and the scientific community.\nThe Reverte (Reverse) program \nThe Reverte (Reverse) program is an initiative of Syngenta and The Nature Conservancy (TNC) aimed at \npromoting, technically and financially, the conversion of degraded pasture areas into agriculturable areas \nin the Cerrado (Brazilian scrubland) region. This movement allows, in addition to the increase in production, \nthe expansion of production areas without the need to open new areas.  The rural producers that join the \nprogram comply with environmental and social criteria defined by the TNC and receive technical guidance \nand technological solutions provided by Syngenta and partners for the implementation of the project of \nrecovery and conversion of areas. We are partners in the Reverte (Reverse) program, providing exclusive \nfinancial solutions that are adequate to the rural producer’s need for the execution of the project.  To date, \nR$276 million that contributed to the conversion of 57,800 hectares of degraded pastures into crops has \nbeen disbursed. \ncase studies \n38 \nItaú Unibanco Holding S.A.climate report 2022\nClimate finance\nClimate products and services\nAs the transition bank, our ESG products and services of the retail, wholesale and investment segments positively contribute to the climate agenda.

Large \ngroups of positive impact sectors were defined, \nsuch as:  \nRenewable energy: Generation of energy from \ncleaner sources, such as solar, wind and small \nhydroelectric power plants; \nAgribusiness: Initiatives that promote the \npreservation of forest areas and good practices \nand investment in productivity, maintenance of \nbiodiversity, the preservation of water resources \nand carbon inventory; \nPulp and paper: Projects that contribute \nto climate mitigation, based on responsible \nmanagement;  \nInfrastructure works: Projects that increase \nthe economic development and reduce \nenvironmental impact through rail transport, \nsanitation and solid waste management;  \nEnergy services: Initiatives that reduce the cost \nof access to energy, making this service more \naccessible across Brazil;\nHealth and education: Hospitals and \nlaboratories that improve the quality of life, and \neducational institutions, which aim at population \nqualification and employability. \nESG debt securities in the capital market\nStructuring of issuances of ESG debt securities \nin local and foreign capital markets following \nthe guidelines of the International Capital \nMarket Association (ICMA) and best market \npractices, including Green, Social, Sustainable \ne Sustainability-linked Bonds operations with \ncharacteristics linked to sustainability targets, \nwhich contribute to the climate goals.\nGreen financial bills\nGreen financial bill operation, the funds of which \nwill be used to support the financing of electric, \nhybrid and multifuel vehicles, aiming at \nfostering the low-carbon economy and boosting \nthe segment of low emission vehicles in Brazil.  \nWe issued additional tranches to this operation \nwith individual and corporate clients and fund \nmanagers, raising more R$500 million.\nGreen Entrepreneur Plan \nThe plan encourages the financing of more \nsustainable real estate developments, \ncommercial or residential, by means of \ndifferential conditions, which may include lower \nfinancing rates.
