Describe \nthe climate-\nrelated \nrisks and \nopportunities \nthe \norganisation \nhas identified \nover the short, \nmedium and \nlong term \nA. Climate change – due to its pervasive and cross-cutting nature – has the \npotential to affect our existing significant risks (e.g. Property, Insurance). \nWe have identified which of our significant risks may be affected – or 'driven' \n– in part by climate change over the short, medium and long term. In line with \nthe TCFD recommendations, we present the relevant risk drivers across two \ndifferent types – Transition (i.e. risks resulting from the transition to a lower \ncarbon economy), and Physical (i.e. risks resulting from short-term changes \nin weather patterns and long-term changes in climate). \nAs detailed in the Financial risks associated with climate change table on page \n46-47, the most relevant transition risk drivers relate to: \n▪ Legal and regulatory changes (short term); \n▪ Reputational risks associated with meeting – or failing to meet – enhanced \nstakeholder expectations (short term); \n▪ Changes in market conditions impacting asset valuations (e.g. property \nportfolio, and investments such as sovereign and corporate bonds) and the \naffordability of our products and services (medium term). \nThe main physical risk drivers relate to: \n▪ Physical risk drivers (such as heatwaves and flooding) which could result \nin business disruption, but also could be a factor in property valuations \n(medium term); \n▪ Impacts to healthcare needs of our insurance customers (i.e. ‘One Health’) \n(long term). \nA key opportunity associated with climate change relates to a shift in consumer \npreference for low carbon products and services. As the economy transitions \nto low carbon this will create opportunities for new corporate and small and \nmedium enterprises (SMEs) to provide alternative services which could have a \npositive impact on revenue, particularly if we are seen to be a strong advocate \nfor positive actions on climate change. \nAdditionally, as noted on page 22, in 2021 we carried out a sustainability \nmateriality assessment to identify the most material ESG topics for the company, \nassessed in terms of potential impact to the business, either as a risk or \nopportunity, and which matter most to our internal and external stakeholders. \nClimate change and ‘One Health’, referring to the intersection between people \nand planet health, were identified within the top five most strategically important \nESG topics. As climate change is a health concern as well as an environmental \nrisk, continued intensification of climate change is projected to increase the \nprevalence of respiratory disease and allergies, cardiovascular disease, mental \nhealth conditions, infectious disease and skin cancer among others. Due to the \nnature of these conditions, another opportunity Bupa has identified is looking \nat how to adapt its products to be able to continue 'helping people live longer, \nhealthier, happier lives and making a better world' in line with our purpose. In \n2023 we will be initiating a more detailed assessment of the climate-related \nopportunities that exist for our business over the short, medium and long term. \nFor more information \non our sustainability \nstrategy, see page \n22-23 \nFor further details \non the impact on \nproducts and services, \nsee Mission Zero \nupdate on page 27 \nFor further details \non the impact on \naccess to capital, \nsee Mission Zero \nupdate on page 25 \nFor further details on \nour decarbonisation \nplanning and transition \nplan development, see \nMission Zero update on \npage 25 \nFor more information \non our sustainability \nmateriality assessment, \nsee Bupa.com here \nThe potential impacts \nof climate change on \nBupa’s significant risks \nare described in the \nRisk section pages \n46-47 \nFor further details on \nour scenario analysis, \nsee the Risk section \npage 48 \nFor more information \non delivery of Board \ntraining, see the Board \ntraining and knowledge \nbuilding section on \npage 52 \nMore information \non our sustainable \nprocurement approach \ncan be found on \npage 32 \nBupa Annual Report 2022 102\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
