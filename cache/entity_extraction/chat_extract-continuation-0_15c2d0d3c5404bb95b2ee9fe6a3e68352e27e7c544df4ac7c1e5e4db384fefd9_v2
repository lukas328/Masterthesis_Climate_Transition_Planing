The directors are \nalso responsible for such internal control as they \ndetermine is necessary to enable the preparation \nof financial statements that are free from material \nmisstatement, whether due to fraud or error. \nIn preparing the financial statements, the directors \nare responsible for assessing the Group’s and the \nCompany’s ability to continue as a going concern, \ndisclosing, as applicable, matters related to going \nconcern and using the going concern basis of \naccounting unless the directors either intend \nto liquidate the Group or the Company or to \ncease operations, or have no realistic alternative \nbut to do so. \nAuditors’ responsibilities for the audit \nof the financial statements \nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance \nabout whether the financial statements as a whole are \nfree from material misstatement, whether due to fraud \nor error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes \nour opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of \nassurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit \nconducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always \ndetect a material misstatement when it exists. \nMisstatements can arise from fraud or error and are \nconsidered material if, individually or in the aggregate, \nthey could reasonably be expected to influence the \neconomic decisions of users taken on the basis of \nthese financial statements. \nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-\ncompliance with laws and regulations. We design \nprocedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined \nabove, to detect material misstatements in respect of \nirregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our \nprocedures are capable of detecting irregularities, \nincluding fraud, is detailed below. \nBased on our understanding of the Group and industry, \nwe identified that the principal risks of non-compliance \nwith laws and regulations related to certain Group \nactivities where non-compliance with the related laws \nand regulations could result in fines or litigation, or loss \nof the Group’s licence to operate. We consider the \nareas most likely to have such an effect would be in \nrelation to financial conduct regulation, healthcare \nprovision conduct regulation and regulatory capital \nand liquidity requirements. In addition, risks arise from \nthe Group’s required compliance with related taxation \nlegislation (including VAT and payroll taxes) and \npensions legislation, and we considered the extent \nto which non-compliance might have a material effect \non the financial statements. We also considered those \nlaws and regulations that have a direct impact on \nthe financial statements such as the Companies Act \n2006. We evaluated management’s incentives and \nopportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the \nfinancial statements (including the risk of override of \ncontrols), and determined that the principal risks were \nrelated to management bias in accounting estimates \nand judgmental areas of the financial statements, \nincluding those shown in our Key Audit Matters, \nand the override of controls including the posting of \ninappropriate journal entries. The Group engagement \nteam shared this risk assessment with the component \nauditors so that they could include appropriate audit \nprocedures in response to such risks in their work. \nAudit procedures performed by the Group engagement \nteam and/or component auditors included: \n▪ Discussions with the Board, management, Internal \nAudit, senior management involved in the Risk and \nCompliance functions and the Group and Company’s \nlegal function, including consideration of known or \nsuspected instances of non-compliance with laws \nand regulation and fraud; \n▪ Evaluation and testing of the operating effectiveness \nof management’s controls designed to prevent and \ndetect irregularities; \nBupa Annual Report 2022 118 \n        \n      \n       \n \n     \n         \n
