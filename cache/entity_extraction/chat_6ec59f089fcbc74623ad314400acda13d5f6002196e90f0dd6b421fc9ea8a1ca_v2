The 2021 50th percentile salary shown in the table above is lower than the lower quartile salary as a result of the Gender Pay Gap data methodology. \nThe Gender Pay Gap data is a snapshot of hourly pay as at 5 April and it is this snapshot that is used to identify the 25th, 50th and 75th percentile \nemployees for this table in line with the CEO Pay Ratio regulations. The table above details actual pay earned through the year for those employees \nidentified at the 25th, 50th and 75th percentile. \nOf the three options available for calculating the pay ratio we have chosen Option B, which uses the most recent \ngender pay gap information (April 2022) to identify and select employees at the 25th, 50th and 75th percentile. \nThis method has been chosen as it makes use of our gender pay data which provides a readily available and robust \ndataset. This is made up of all UK employees from Bupa’s insurance, corporate functions and health provision \nbusinesses. To ensure that the results are representative of the employee population’s pay and benefits at those \nquartiles, Bupa has chosen to use a median value of the pay and benefits for the 15 employees above and below, \nand including, the individual at the given quartile. This approach was taken to allow for any leavers through the \nyear, given Bupa’s large and diverse workforce. The annual remuneration figures are taken across the full year \nending 31 December 2022. \nChanges to the CEO pay ratio at the salary level reflect actions taken by Bupa on pay to address issues with the \ncost of living crisis. Furthermore, the significant changes in the overall position this year with regards to total pay \nand benefits is in part a result of the reduced single total figure for the Group CEO due to changes in the vesting \nschedule of Bupa’s long-term incentive schemes as outlined in last year's report. \nIn reviewing the employee pay data, the Committee is comfortable that the overall picture presented by the ratios \nis consistent with our pay, reward and progression policies for UK employees. \nIn the table above, the Committee has chosen to provide information relating to salary in addition to the total \nremuneration calculations. As incentive pay can significantly vary year on year, the Committee determined that \nthe salary ratio provides helpful context beyond that of the single figure. \nUK employees 25th percentile 50th percentile 75th percentile \n2022 Total pay and benefits £24,112 £24,287 £43,745 \n2022 Salary only £22,721 £23,301 £38,339 \n2021 Total pay and benefits £22,584 £21,632 £37,930 \n2021 Salary only £22,358 £21,120 £34,889 \n2020 Total pay and benefits £21,392 £21,528 £38,371 \n2020 Salary only £20,340 £21,373 £34,085 \n2019 Total pay and benefits £21,899 £25,412 £31,468 \n2019 Salary only £20,325 £23,543 £29,914 \nRelative importance of spend on pay \nThe table below shows the relative importance of spend on pay.
