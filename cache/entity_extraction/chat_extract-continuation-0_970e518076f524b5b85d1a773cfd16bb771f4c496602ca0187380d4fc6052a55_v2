These discussions were centered around Mizuho Bank’s \ncorporate banking departments, but also attended by representatives from Mizuho Bank ’s Industry Research \nDepartment, Mizuho Securities, and Mizuho Leasing. Aeon Mall ’s needs included a shift in goals from procuring  \neffectively CO2-free energy to having malls under direct management run on 100% locally generated renewable energy. \nMizuho Bank, Mizuho Securities, and Mizuho Leasings worked with a power generation operation and maintenance \n(O&M) company to propose a low-pressure / distributed solar power generation facility with a self-consignment system, \nleading to a basic agreement on what will be one of the largest-scale projects of its kind in Japan. \n \nMizuho is supporting specific initiatives conducted as part of Aeon Mall’s transition to a low-carbon society by leveraging \nour financial and non-financial expertise and providing decarbonized solutions and financing in collaboration with the  \npower generation O&M company. \n \nClient feedback \n Background, significance, and outlook: \nThe concept behind this initiative is for Aeon Mall to use locally generated electricity, and to ensure that customers \nunderstand the initiative. \nAeon Mall plans for all facilities under direct company management to be powered by local  renewable energy by \n2040. With solar energy procurement as the first step, going forward, Aeon Mall intends to make full use of wind, \nbiomass, and other power generation methods, storage batteries, and more. Further, it will quantify its customers’ \npro-environment efforts, such as making use of renewably sourced electric power for their EVs (V2AEON MALL), \nplanting trees, and recovering discarded plastic. This quantification makes it possible to connect increased \nawareness of environmental efforts with systems for awarding points and will allow Aeon Mall to build a low-carbon \nsociety together with its customers. \n\n  \nTCFD Report 2022  -33- \n \n  \n \n \n(3) Discussing the achievement of a low-carbon society through senior level engagement (Canada / Energy) \nIn order to engage in deeper conversations with the heads of companies, we reached out to the CEOs of multiple major \ncompanies in Canada and the US that have connections to the energy sector. We held a roundtable discussion with \nthem, which featured conversations about initiatives for making a low-carbon society a reality. \n \nMain opinions and discussion points \n Due to COP26 and changes in the external business environment, including demand for energy exceeding supply, \nit is possible that the decarbonization movement may temporarily lose momentum. But, in the medium to long term, \nthe shift towards renewable energy that can be both low in cost and generated locally will continue. \n With the current situation being what it is, there is growing importance for fossil fuels in terms of their role in the \nenergy transition. This should be taken into consideration. \n There are challenges such as the effect soaring energy prices have  on voting behavior and political agendas, \nespecially in developing countries. In some regions there is a trend to use coal-fired power more. \n The establishment and adoption of innovative technology necessitates looser restrictions and more flexibility from \nregulatory authorities. \n As companies around the world push forward with decarbonization-focused commitments and initiatives, the \npresence of ESG elements in communications with investors and other stakeholders continues to be of importance. \nThere is a high investor appetite for decarbonization (including green energy, technological innovation) \ninvestments. \n Discussions aimed at providing solutions: \nThrough this project, which involves Mizuho, Aeon Mall, and a power generation O&M company, Mizuho has carried \nout project management that leverages our expertise in both financial and non-financial services. Our efforts led to \nan agreement being reached smoothly and quickly, a first step towards achieving a low-carbon society. \n \n Expectations for Mizuho going forward: \nThere are hopes for this initiative between Mizuho and a large-scale consumer to pave the way for the adoption of \nrenewable energy throughout the country. This initiative is the first step towards achieving the local  renewable \nenergy system desired by Aeon Mall . With regards to future initiatives for increasing the energy supply and \ndiversifying the forms of power generation, support is expected from a collaboration between Mizuho and a partner \ncompany from Mizuho’s network. \n(4) Engagement for promoting climate change countermeasures at middle market firms and small- and medium-\nsized enterprises (Japan / Various sectors) \nIn the midst of accelerating company -led climate change-related initiatives, there are demands for environmental and \nsocial initiatives that span entire supply chains. However, in order to further advance climate change countermeasures, \nit is essential to receive cooperation not only from large corporations, but also from middle market firms and small- and \nmedium-sized enterprises (SMEs). We have many clients who, despite acknowledging climate change countermeasures \nbeing an operational challenge that needs to be faced, are unsure about setting targets and worried about what action \nto take. For this reason, Mizuho is enhancing our middle market firm and SME -oriented sustainability-related\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
