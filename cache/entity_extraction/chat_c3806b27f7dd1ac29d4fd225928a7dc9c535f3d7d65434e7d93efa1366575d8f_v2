This means our carbon \nintensity by revenue reduced year on year. See graphs 1 and 2 for revenue growth and carbon intensity trends.\nThis emissions performance was delivered by continued deployment of our âWinsightâ transport planning and digital transport \nsuites; reduced sub-contract road freight spend; increased use of hydro-treated vegetable oil (HVO) renewable fuel; increased use \nof natural gas for transport; and shifts in our business mix towards less carbon intensive revenue streams. \nEmissions reduction targets\nCurrently, we have a âqualitativeâ, long-term, ânet-zero by 2040â target which has not been verified formally by the Science Based \nTargets Initiative. We have not yet committed to a formal science-based target (SBT). We evaluated an SBT during FY2023 and \nwhile we recognise that this has become a standardised approach for many companies, decarbonisation trajectories for the freight \ntransport sector remain unclear. \nOur progress against targets is currently focused on scope 1 and 2 emissions and we anticipate that we will achieve a 30% \nreduction in emissions by 2030 based on the wider industry decarbonisation and legislative landscape; our progress at optimising \nour diesel fuel usage; use of transition fuels like HVO; and limited early adoption of electric trucks in heavier weight categories. \nWe expect a further 70% reduction from 2030 to 2040 as electrification technologies and infrastructure, potentially including \nhydrogen, become more widespread and commercially available.\nIn our initial 2021 PPN 06/21 Carbon Reduction Plan (CRP), we used a simple linear methodology to project our target trajectory \nover the target period. \nAs we have engaged with and explored alternative fuel and zero emission technology timelines through this year, we have adjusted \nthe original target trajectory methodology to reflect the timelines we are seeing from our technology and innovation partners. \nWe now use a non-linear methodology to reflect our belief that, as the freight transport carbon reduction ecosystem matures and \nzero emission technology and infrastructure become more widely available, we will see the pace of carbon reduction increase in \nthe second half of the 2020s. Reduction will then continue at the rate that we can convert fleets at times of renewal and contract \naward making progress more linear to 2040. Graph 1 Illustrates our performance against our non-linear target trajectory to 2030.\nAfter 2040, we anticipate that any remaining residual emissions will be offset using appropriate, authentic carbon reduction credits \nuntil we can finally remove all emissions. We may use carbon credits before this for selected customers, sectors or sites where \ncarbon neutral operation is required and feasible.\n4\nGraph 1 â Emissions Performance and Target Trajectory\nGraph 2 illustrates the same target trajectory but maps carbon intensity by revenue showing our carbon reduction is helping us to \nstay on track despite revenue growth. Making significant emissions reductions to compensate for further growth will require us \nto complete wholesale introductions of alternative fuels and zero emission technologies and we will not be able to rely solely on \nefficiency gains and incremental improvement.\nGraph 2 â Carbon Emissions Intensity by Revenue\nCarbon reduction plan - July 2023\nCarbon reduction plan - July 2023 5\nCarbon reduction initiatives\nCarbon reduction initiatives\nOur target is an absolute one and, whilst in the earlier phases we will aim to continuously improve transport and energy efficiency, \nour plans are to utilise alternative fuels and electrification to achieve the emissions reductions we have committed to.\nWincanton has held the Carbon Trust Standard (CTS) since 2010, which has required us to demonstrate carbon reductions  \nyear on year for the past twelve years. We have now moved away from the CTS and certified our carbon accounting process to  \nISO14064-1:2018 to provide external assurance of our carbon reduction programme. We also have an environmental management \nsystem in place that is available to all operations and is certified to ISO14001:2015 giving us a solid platform to achieve our  \nimprovement goals.\nThe initiatives below have been or can be implemented on all customer contracts relevant to the technology solution and it is not \nan exhaustive list of all projects. The diversity of the Wincanton contract portfolio means that not all carbon reduction initiatives \nare effective in all applications. The appropriate and effective solutions will be implemented for a particular contract agreed \ncollaboratively with our customer.\nFleet and Transport\nEmissions from transport make up over 83% of our total scope 1, 2 and 3 carbon emissions. We continue to invest in our fleet \ntypically replacing 15-20% of our vehicles each year. Over 98% of the vehicles we operate are Euro VI and when we upgrade these, \nwe ensure we include the latest engine variants and fuel saving features such as adaptive cruise control; automatic braking; and \npredictive power train control.\nWe have fitted most of our vehicles with vision-enabled telematics and established an industry leading driver assessment  \nand coaching programme to keep our drivers firmly in the âgreenâ performance zone which results in the best fuel efficiency.\nWe are utilising âgreenâ, low rolling resistance tyres where appropriate, are utilising âmirrorlessâ vehicles that provide some \naerodynamic benefit, and, where appropriate, we use light-weighted trailers, double decks and longer semi-trailers to  \noptimise load fill.\nWe continue to implement our cloud-based transport planning system which is a multi-year project that will provide significant \nbenefits in vehicle utilisation, routing and loading across our diverse portfolio over the coming years. It will be deployed on those \nfleets where it will provide sustainable value in network optimization\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
