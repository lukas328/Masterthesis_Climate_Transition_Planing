I held regular \nmeetings with the lead audit partner throughout the \nyear. The Committee approved the external audit plan \nand audit fee for the audit of the 2022 Annual Report. \nFor information on the fees paid to PwC for non-audit \nservices provided during the year see Note 2.3.3 on \npage 140. \nThe Committee has recommended to the Board that \nPwC be re-appointed as the Groupâs External Auditor \nat the 2023 AGM. The Group intends to tender the \nExternal Auditor appointment at least every ten years. \nMore information on the role of the External Auditor \nand how PwC maintains its independence from Bupa \nis set out in Bupaâs system of governance section on \npage 65. \nLiaison with other Board Committees \nThe Committee works closely with the Risk Committee \nand has held joint meetings to receive updates on the \ncontrol environment in our businesses in TÃ¼rkiye, Chile \nand Poland, and an update on the IMS programme. \nA joint meeting was also held in early 2023 to consider \nan integrated assurance report giving the opinions of \nall three lines on the Groupâs control environment in \nrelation to the 2022 financial year. As noted above, a \njoint meeting was held with the Board Sustainability \nCommittee in late 2022 to review the Groupâs draft \n2021 GHG Emissions Report and the limited external \nassurance over this report. \nIn early 2023, I attended a meeting of the Remuneration \nCommittee to provide a view on the quality of Bupaâs \nearnings in 2022 to aid the Remuneration Committeeâs \ndecision on the appropriateness of the financial \nperformance data used in connection with the \ncalculation of the bonuses potentially payable \nunder the incentive schemes within the \nRemuneration Committeeâs remit. \nSubsidiary governance \nThe chairs of each of Bupaâs major insurance subsidiary \naudit committees are invited to attend a meeting of the \nCommittee each year and provide a written update \nannually. The Market Unit heads of internal audit join the \nsubsidiary audit committee chairs when they present to \nthe Committee. This provides valuable insights to the \nCommittee and to the subsidiary audit committee chairs \non the issues that are material in each context. I also \nattend a meeting of each of the major insurance \nsubsidiary audit committees each year and meet with \nthe subsidiary's internal audit director. The minutes of \nthe meetings of the major insurance subsidiary audit \ncommittees are also made available to the Committee. \nCommittee effectiveness review \nDr Tracy Long, of Boardroom Review, observed a \nmeeting of the Committee in late 2022 and discussed \nthe operation of the Committee in her individual \ninterviews with the Committee members. The \nevaluation report indicated that the Committee was \nworking well, noting in particular its good use of time \nand quality of discussions. The report has assisted in \nidentifying priorities for 2023, in particular the increased \nfocus on sustainability reporting and on collaboration \nwith the Board Sustainability Committee. \nThe 2021 internal review of the Committeeâs \neffectiveness concluded that the Committee was \noperating effectively. During the year, the Committee \nreviewed progress against the recommendations \nfrom the 2021 review and was satisfied that they \nwere being addressed. Details of the Committeeâs \ninteractions with the audit committees of Bupaâs major \ninsurance subsidiaries, the Groupâs reporting controls \nenvironment, and the alignment of Bupaâs assurance \nfunctions are provided above. \nFocus for 2023 \nDuring 2023, the Committee will focus on preparations \nfor how we address the UK Government's former BEIS \nand FRC requirements on restoring trust in audit and \ncorporate governance, Bupaâs first external reporting \nunder IFRS 17 and on enhancing the quality of the \nGroupâs sustainability disclosures. \nPaul Evans \nAudit Committee Chair \nBupa Annual Report 2022 72\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
