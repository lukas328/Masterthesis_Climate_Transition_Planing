The main \nchange compared to the awards granted last year is a greater weighting to the strategic and \nsustainability targets (up from 20%) which reflects the strategic priorities over the next \nthree-year period.\nThe EPS growth targets to apply to the awards are considered similarly challenging to the \ntargets set in prior years. However, in recognition of ongoing uncertainty and volatility in \nexternal markets, we have set a wider range of targets versus historic awards.\nOur strategic and sustainability targets are focused on increasing the GHG emissions avoided \nthrough the use of our products and solutions, reducing our own GHG (Scope 1 and Scope 2), \nincreasing the percentage of female representation across our management levels and \ndelivering a key business transformation associated with global business services.\nGiven our refreshed strategy will require investment over the coming years, a final change to \nthe PSP awards is the removal of the discretionary return on invested capital (ROIC) underpin. \nHowever, the Committee retains discretion to adjust the vesting outcomes based on \nunderlying performance and having had regard to ROIC.\nPrior to granting the 2023/24 PSP award the committee intends to undertake a final review \nof the performance targets allowing for the prevailing market conditions versus the time at \nwhich the proposed targets were set. Full details of the intended awards are set out on page \n122.\nChair and non-executive director fees\nThe fees payable to the Chair and non-executive directors are reviewed annually. In line with \nthe increase in base salaries for executive directors, the Chair fee and non-executive director \nbase fee will be increased by 3.5% from 1st April 23 (lower than the increase to the wider \nworkforce).Â The additional premiums for acting as a Chair of a committee were also \nreviewedÂ andÂ increased. \nWider employee remuneration\nPaying our employees fairly for their role, skills, experience and performance is central to our \napproach to remuneration, and our reward framework and policies support us in doing this.\nEqual pay is also critical, and we review our pay levels on an ongoing basis to ensure that \nemployees are paid fairly. During the year we reviewed a global analysis, conducted by an \nindependent reward consultancy (Willis Tower Watson) on pay levels and pay equity across \nthe organisation, which showed that nearly 95% of roles are paid fairly, and we continue \ntoÂ make targeted actions to remove any form of potential inequality. We are also committed \nto the real living wage and narrowing the gender pay gap that exists among our employees, \nand to tackling the root causes of gender imbalance to ensure a truly inclusive culture that \nsupports diversity. Our commitment in this area has resulted in a reduction in our gender pay \ngap in the UK from 9.2% to 5.6% over the past few years, and we are starting to make \nprogress in other countries.\nWe aspire to offer a well-balanced, progressive and structured approach to reward, with \nappropriate variation by location. We also find that the non-financial reward elements are \nessential to a supportive culture, with the wellbeing of staff a prominent part of our \nemployment proposition.\nThis year, all employees were able to provide their feedback on a range of matters, including \nremuneration, through The Big Listen, our annual employee engagement survey (YourSay) \nand local and global town hall meetings. This provided valuable employee context to decision \nmaking when considering changes to the Remuneration Policy and how the company \nrewards employees for the impact of their contributions. \nShareholder engagement\nAhead of the 2023 AGM, we engaged with our largest investors as well as Institutional \nShareholder Services (â€˜ISSâ€™), The Investment Association (â€˜IAâ€™) and Glass Lewis, to understand \ntheir views on our proposed new policy and the proposed implementation in 2023/24. \nTheÂ feedback we received was supportive of retaining our current approach to directorsâ€™ \nremuneration and the minor refinements we proposed.\n2023 AGM\nI would like to thank shareholders for their input and engagement during the year in relation \nto the Remuneration Policy. We believe that our policy remains simple, transparent and \neffective, strongly supporting our business strategy with remuneration outcomes aligned \ntoÂ the shareholder experience.\nI ask you to support the binding vote on Directors' Remuneration Policy and the advisory vote \non this Annual Statement and the 2023 Annual Report on Remuneration at our AGM on \n20thÂ July 2023. This AGM will be my last as Chair of the Remuneration Committee as I stand \ndown as Committee Chair with effect from the upcoming AGM but will continue on the Board \nuntil January 2024 when I will retire from the Board.
