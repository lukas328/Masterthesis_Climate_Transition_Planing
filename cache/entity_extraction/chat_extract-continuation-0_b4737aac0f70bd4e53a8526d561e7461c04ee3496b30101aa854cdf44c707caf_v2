This builds on our earlier successful \ncollaboration with the University of Edinburgh Centre for Business, Climate Change and Sustainability (UoE \nB-CCaS) and seeks to support the evolution and growth of existing programmes. The renewed collaboration \nwill deliver new awareness education to all colleagues across NatWest Group, as well as specialist learning to \nmore than 16,000 people by the end of 2024.\nEducation as an enabler\nWe all have an important role to play in the transition to a \nmore sustainable future. At NatWest Group, we recognise \nthe importance of investing in our people to build the future \nskills and behaviours we need to realise our purpose.\nWith an initial focus on climate change and the environment, \nlearning programmes have been designed at three different \nlevels to enable colleagues to develop the capability relevant \nto them. The aim is to create a consistent language across \nour organisation, promoting better discussions, decision-\nmaking and risk management, while facilitating good \ncustomer conversations to support their transition.\nA tailored approach\nBuilding on the success of previous education programmes, \nwe continued to drive a One Bank approach, working with \nthe business to listen, learn and evolve our approach \ncentred on three key ambitions:\n • Providing easily accessible climate awareness learning, \nenabling people to take ownership and act.\n • Equip colleagues in priority roles with the capability \nto do their job, manage climate-related risks and \nsupport customers to transition.\n • Inspire climate action and innovation through learning, \nthought leadership and global outreach.\nDeveloped using colleague insights and testing, we use a \nrange of learning materials to engage colleagues including:\n • A blended mix of self-paced learning, delivered through \nmulti-media bitesize content, complemented by live \nevents to help activate and embed knowledge.\n • Content across a range of topics tailored to different job \nroles, areas of the bank and levels of experience.\n • Harnessing voices from across the business through \ninterviews, case studies and live project examples to help \ncolleagues understand the opportunities and challenges.\n • Tools for thinking and action – to aid discussion, analysis \nand behaviour change in team meetings and \nconversations with customers.\n • Promoting a culture of continuous learning by bringing \npeers together to share knowledge and best practice.\nEnhancing capability, developing expertise\nTo re-baseline climate awareness and catalyse action across \nthe organisation, driving further engagement and advocacy, \nthis year we launched the Climate Change Fundamentals \nto 64,611(1) colleagues. Comprised of six bitesize digital \nmodulesfeaturing micro lectures from the UoE B-CCaS, \nNatWest Group and industry experts, the content was \ndesigned to help colleagues connect climate change to their \nrole, understand the potential impacts and the positive \nactions they can take both personally and professionally.\nIn addition, 610 colleagues completed the Climate Change \nTransformation Programme in 2022, bringing our cumulative \ntotal to 1,721 colleagues over the past years. This bespoke \n12-week programme, designed in partnership with UoE \nB-CCaS, gives colleagues the necessary knowledge to \nsupport our climate ambitions. The content helps to develop \nan understanding of and the ability to drive sustainable \nleadership, systems change, effective decision-making, risk \nmanagement, managing client conversations and green \ninnovation, building confidence and agency to take action.\nOver 4,000 colleagues took part in our Sustainable \nFutures 101 awareness series covering topics including \nclimate, biodiversity, oceans, transport and energy. \nThis was led by our employee-led Sustainable Futures \nNetwork, which supports colleagues to engage with \nsustainability at a grass roots level.\n(1)  Includes some types of contingent workers.\nCommercial real estate\nThe UoE B-CCaS and NatWest Group \nworked with several industry partners \nincluding real estate expert Cushman and \nWakefield to support the commercial real \nestate specialist training. Since launching in \nApril 2022, 290 colleagues have completed \nthe training which will continue in 2023.\nAfter completing the programme more than \n90% of respondents agreed or strongly \nagreed that knowledge of climate change \ncontributes to enhanced organisational \nresilience, better decisions, improved \nengagement with stakeholders and enhanced \nprotection against business risks.\nKey takeaways were:\n • The scale and urgency of the challenge\n • The impact of the real estate sector  \non climate change\n • What customers need to do to improve \ntheir energy performance\n • The impact of climate change and \nassociated risks\nMaking a difference\nSince going through the learning colleagues \nhave stated actions taken as a result of the \nprogramme include:\n • Having meaningful conversations with \ncustomers to support their transition\n • Consideration of climate-related risks in \ndecision-making\n • Cascading learning to team/colleagues\n • Changing personal habits and pursuing \nfurther learning on climate change\nIn one 2022 example, following completion of \ntheir sector training and ahead of a \nrefinancing deal, a relationship manager \nsupported a customer to develop a strategy \nfor their property portfolio, giving them \nfurther awareness of climate-related risks \nand the regulatory roadmap.\nThe main impact from the programme \nwas increased confidence and awareness. \n96% of respondents felt they had learned \nhow their role and profession can aid in \ncombating climate change and 86% felt \nbetter equipped to respond to and \nmake decisions connected with climate \nchange impacts.\n64,000+(1)\nNatWest Group colleagues gained access to \nour Climate Change Fundamentals training in \nJanuary 2023, with six months to complete \nthe 60-minute learning.\nSector spotlight:\n546\ncol\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>UNIVERSITY OF
