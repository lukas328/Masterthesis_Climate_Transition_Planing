In case of a discrepancy, the Spanish original will prevail.\nSECTION 03 / MANAGEMENT OF RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CLIMATE CHANGE\nMeasurement and integration \nof transition risk\nIn 2022, sustainability factors continued \nto be included as one of the analysis axis \nin the Action Frameworks of all the sectors \nincluded in the taxonomy as High transition \nrisk. In these Action Frameworks, the risks \nand opportunities of the climate transition \nare incorporated as an additional factor in \nthe definition of the risk portfolio view, which \nis carried out annually and where the risk \nappetite is defined at sector level.\nIn sectors classified as High transition risk, \ntransition risk assessment criteria have \nbegun to be defined at customer level based \non their alignment with the objectives of \nthe Paris Agreement or the ambition and \ncredibility of their transition plans. In some \ncases, this analysis leads to the definition of \nspecific risk policies with the customer or to \nthe definition of credit risk mitigants.\nIn addition to the integration into the \nsectoral frameworks, in 2022, sustainability \nfactors also continued to be systematically \nintegrated into the customer analysis \nprocesses for credit origination, enabling \ntheir incorporation into decision making.\nThis analysis is performed in an environment \nintegrated in BBVA’s systems, called ESG \nClient T oolkit, which presents a common \ninterface for the Risk and Business teams \nwhere the customers’ sustainability \ninformation is viewed. This interface \nprovides insight into climate transition \nstrategies, governance and climate change \nrisk and opportunity management practices, \ndecarbonization metrics and targets, as well \nas progress in the management of other \nESG aspects material to the customer’s \nsector of activity, its compliance with BBVA’s \nEnvironmental and Social Framework, \nexistence of social, environmental and \nethical controversies and its level of \nalignment with the objectives of the Paris \nAgreement and level of emissions financed. \nThis environment integrates the calculation \nof the transition risk scorecard, known as the \nT ransition Risk indicator.\nMoreover, for those sectors classified as \nhigh transition risk, an advanced transition \nrisk scorecard has been developed to \nincorporate transition risk dimensions in the \ncustomer’s profile. The scorecard evaluates \nthe company’s current low-carbon profile; \nthe levels of regulatory pressure in the \ngeographic areas where it is present; its level \nof disclosure on climate management in \nline with TCFD recommendations; and the \nambition and maturity of its decarbonization \nobjectives. The result of the scorecard is a \nvaluable tool to better identify the strengths \nand weaknesses of customers and to define \nconcrete products to help them in the \ntransition to low-carbon business models.\nIn 2022, versions of the transition scorecard \nwere developed for the steel and cement \nsectors to join those previously defined for \nAutomotive, Power Generation and Oil & \nGas. The number of customers for whom \nthe transition scorecard is available has \nbeen significantly expanded and work has \nbegun on integrating it into standard risk \nmanagement processes. The following \nimage shows the results of the transition \nscorecard of the main customers in BBVA’s \noil & gas, power generation, autos, steel \nand cement manufacturing portfolio (the \nsize of the circles represents the number of \ncustomers in each category):\nP.  64\nBBVA Report on TCFD 2022\nThis English version is a translation of the original in Spanish for information purposes only.

In all of them, one \nof the main aspects that determines \nthe transition risk are carbon emissions \nassociated with each of them. These \nemissions are associated with the use of \nfossil fuels or electricity, or dependence on \nthem for the correct operation of the asset \nor customer. Therefore, the calculation \nof financed emissions serves as a lever \nto identify the portfolios that are most \nsensitive to changes in regulation, fuel \nprices or depreciation of certain types of \n“unsustainable” assets. In turn, to mitigate \nrisk, BBVA also acts as a financing facilitator \nto address the investments required for \nclimate change mitigation and adaptation \nto climate change with more sustainable \nforms of life and products.\nIn the case of mortgages, during 2022 \nwe worked on the correct collection \nof consumption and emissions data \nassociated with mortgage guarantees, \nboth from real and estimated Energy \nEfficiency Certificates (EEC), and in \nSpain we are promoting the standardized \nand homogeneous collection of these \nestimates and real EEC data at sector level. \nBased on the definition made in 2021 of \nsustainability criteria to classify when a \ncollateral asset is considered sustainable, \nBBVA has applied differentiated pricing to \nloans with sustainability content, such as \nin the Efficient Home Mortgage, for homes \nwith consumption letter A or B.\nIn the case of vehicle loans, as well as \nthe type of\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BBVA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>BBVA is a financial institution that manages risks associated with climate change, incorporates sustainability factors into its analysis and decision-making processes, and develops tools like the ESG Client Toolkit and transition scorecards to evaluate customer profiles and sector risks related to climate transition.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>TCFD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) is an international organization that provides recommendations for climate-related financial risk disclosures, which BBVA follows in its reporting.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARIS AGREEMENT<|>EVENT<|>International climate accord aimed at limiting global warming, which influences BBVA's climate risk assessment and decarbonization strategies.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>STEEL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Steel sector is a high transition risk industry evaluated by BBVA's transition scorecard, focusing on its low-carbon profile and decarbonization objectives.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>CEMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cement sector is a high transition risk industry assessed by BBVA's transition scorecard, with emphasis on its regulatory pressure and decarbonization efforts.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>OIL & GAS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Oil & Gas industry is a high transition risk sector evaluated by BBVA's transition scorecard, considering its current low-carbon profile and regulatory environment.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUTOS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Automotive sector is assessed by BBVA's transition scorecard, focusing on its strategies for low-carbon transition and decarbonization plans.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>POWER GENERATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Power generation sector is evaluated by BBVA's transition scorecard, analyzing its decarbonization metrics and climate management practices.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPAIN<|>GEO<|>Country where BBVA operates and promotes standardized collection of energy efficiency data for mortgages.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>AEROPORT<|>GEO<|>Generic placeholder for a location, not explicitly mentioned but relevant in the context of infrastructure and climate risk assessment.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>ENERGY EFFICIENCY CERTIFICATES<|>EVENT<|>Certificates used to measure and verify the energy consumption and emissions of assets like homes, relevant for assessing sustainability and risk.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>ESG Client Toolkit<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A digital interface developed by BBVA that consolidates climate transition strategies, governance, decarbonization metrics, and sustainability information for customer analysis.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Transition Risk Scorecard<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A tool developed by BBVA to evaluate the climate transition risk profile of customers, considering factors like low-carbon profile, regulatory pressure, and decarbonization objectives.)##\n(\"entity\"<|>Climate Change<|>EVENT<|>Global environmental challenge influencing financial risk management, regulatory policies, and corporate decarbonization efforts, central to BBVA's risk management framework.)##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
