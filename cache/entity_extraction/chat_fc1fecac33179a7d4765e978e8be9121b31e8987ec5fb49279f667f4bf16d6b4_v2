The Association of British Insurers (‘ABI’) \nhas estimated £2.7 trillion of investment is needed \nin the UK between 2021–35, of which its members \ncould provide around £0.9 trillion, or £60 billion \nper annum1. However, this is a small proportion of \nthe £1.9 trillion of assets managed by the UK \ninsurance and long-term savings industry 2. It is \nclear that our sector has a critical role to play in the \nnet zero journey.\nAnalysis by the CCC, shown in figure 6, \ndemonstrates that investment costs are, over time, \noutweighed by the savings they deliver. In the \nlong-term, this is a cross-economy ‘spend to save’ \nscheme. And in the shorter term, many of the \nactions we need to take to accelerate the transition \nto net zero are the same actions we need to take \nto address the energy crisis.\nAs outlined in the Mission Zero, Independent \nReview of Net Zero by the Rt Hon Chris Skidmore \nMP, early action also increases the opportunity to \ncapture financial returns from high growth ‘clean’ \nassets, with the UK well positioned to develop \ncomparative advantage in technologies such as \noffshore wind, carbon capture usage and storage, \nhydrogen and sustainable finance 3. \nDelay is costly: globally, the estimated yearly \nadditional cost to the financial sector of corporates \ndelaying their net zero transition beyond 2026 \ncould reach US$ 272 billion for every year that \nsufficient climate action is not taken 4. In the UK, \nthe Office of Budget Responsibility and Bank \nof England have both warned that a late and \nabrupt response to climate risk would trigger  \na ‘messy recession’ 5. \nIt is therefore imperative that the scale of  \nfinancing meets the urgency and scale of the \nchallenge to deliver growth and mitigate risk.\nFigure 6 – Capital investment costs and operating  \ncost savings in the CCC balanced net zero pathway6\nWhilst the capital costs to reach net zero are significant, the operating cost savings  \noutweigh them over time. \n Other\n Networks\n Electricity supply \n Buildings\n Surface transport\n1 ABI Climate Roadmap.\n2 ABI response to green finance strategy call for evidence.\n3 Net Zero Review – Final Report.\n4 Emissions Gap Report 2022 – UNEP.\n5 Cost for the Financial Sector if Firms Delay Climate Action.\n6 Sixth Carbon Budget – CCC\n15\nPhoenix Group Holdings plc Net Zero Transition Plan\nInvest Engage Lead\nEmbedding net zero \nin our business\nBecoming a \nnet zero business Measuring our progress\nExecutive \nsummary\nThe case for action \nfor Phoenix Group\nThere is a clear case for action \nto address climate change at a \nwhole-economy level, and the \nsame is true for Phoenix Group. \nBy taking the right actions to decarbonise, we can \nhelp our customers and shareholders grow their \ninvestments and protect them against risk and help \nsociety to achieve net zero. \nWe can also utilise our scale and influence to work \nwith our colleagues, suppliers and industry bodies \nto deliver wider systemic change.\nOur core role is to invest and manage assets on \nbehalf of our customers to help them secure a life \nof possibilities. In doing so, we must balance the \nneed for returns with the right level of risk. Both of \nthose elements – risk and return – point towards \ndecarbonising our investments in a way that \nreduces our customers’ exposure to climate-\nrelated risk and ensures continued stable financial \nreturns. We know that our customers expect us to \ntake action, with recent research finding that 90% \nof customers think that it’s important we invest \ntheir money in a responsible way and 80% of \ncustomers concerned about climate change. With \nc.£260 billion assets under administration (AUA), \nwe can play a meaningful role in accelerating the \nbroader economy-wide transition to net zero.\nBy decarbonising our portfolio at the right pace, \nwe can reduce our exposure to companies with \nsignificant climate risk whose business models \nmay become obsolete as the world dec\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
