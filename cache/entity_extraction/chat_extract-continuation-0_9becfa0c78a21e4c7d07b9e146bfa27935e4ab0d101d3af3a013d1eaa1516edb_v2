T o reflect \nthis, companies’ future \ntransition plans will need to be \nimproved to reflect companies’ \ndependencies and impacts \non nature and biodiversity \nincluding just transition.\nThe General Sustainability Policy posits the \nprotection of natural capital as one of its \nmain focuses of action. Specifically, BBVA \nrecognizes the need to protect ecosystem \nservices and natural assets, native species \nand natural ecological  processes. It \nconsiders biodiversity and natural capital in \nits relationship with its clients.\nThe Environmental and Social Framework \nincludes a range of general bans and \nprohibited activities related to biodiversity \nloss and the fight against deforestation:\n Projects that threaten UNESCO World \nHeritage sites, Ramsar-listed wetlands, \nAlliance for Zero Extinction sites and \nInternational Union for Conservation of \nNature category I-IV sites.\n Projects involving resettlement or \ninfringement of the rights of indigenous \nor vulnerable groups without their free, \nprior and informed consent.\n Projects related to deforestation:: burning \nof natural ecosystems for the purpose \nof clearing land for the implementation \nof agricultural or livestock projects, \nelimination of high conservation value \nand high carbon forests, palm oil farms \nnot certified or not in the process of \ncertification by the Roundtable for \nSustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), palm oil \nfarms in swamps and peat-rich areas, \nand from 2022, projects in IUCN key \nbiodiversity areas of the Brazilian Amazon \nand Cerrado.\nIf BBVA concludes that any of the \ncircumstances described in the prohibited \nactivities or general bans apply to a project, \nit will decline to participate in that project.\nIn 2022, BBVA has identified the levels of \nenvironmental impact and dependencies \nfor sectors following the methodology of the \nENCORE tool, which enables us to know how \neach of the financed sectors has an adverse \nimpact on natural resources. The tool was \ndeveloped by the Natural Capital Finance \nAlliance in collaboration with UNEP-WCMC. \nBBVA conducted an impact analysis using \nUNEP-FI’s Impact T ool which assesses the \nimpacts related to natural capital in most of \nthe countries in which BBVA is present.\nP.  68\nBBVA Report on TCFD 2022\nThis English version is a translation of the original in Spanish for information purposes only.
