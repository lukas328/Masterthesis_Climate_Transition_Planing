This plan focuses on \nthe delivery of our 2030 decarbonisation ambitions and will inform further work on \nour journey to net zero by 2050 across our financed emissions, assets under \nmanagement and our operational value chain. \n • We have enhanced the financial planning process to incorporate actions included \nwithin the initial iteration of our Climate transition plan and also used the financial \nforecasts to consider impacts on our Climate transition plan.\n • We continued to harness climate-related opportunities including providing climate and \nsustainable funding and financing and a range of green loan products and services. \n • We will continue to work on aligning the financial \nplanning and transition planning processes. \n • We will further enhance carbon planning, \nmeasurement and tracking capability to support \nthe ongoing development of our Climate \ntransition plan. \n1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 2,3, \n3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, \n3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 4.2. \n4.2a, 4.3, 5.4, \n5.5, 5.7 \nThe resilience of our strategy, \ntaking into consideration \ndifferent climate-related \nscenarios, including a 2°C \nor lower scenario\n • We ran internal scenario analysis and completed round two of the Bank of \nEngland’s Climate Biennial Exploratory Scenario (CBES) exercise, as well as \ndeveloping internal scenario analysis tools and core strategic climate risk modelling \ncapabilities to embed within our existing risk management processes.\n • This work allowed us to assess our exposure to climate-related risk across our lending \nbook and provided insights which we continue to incorporate within our climate strategy \nand to inform work on the initial iteration of our Climate transition plan.\n • One of the key lessons from this work is that while climate-related risks could \npotentially amplify other risk drivers, for example resulting in effects such as the \nerosion of competitiveness, profitability, or reputational damage, overall NatWest \nGroup is resilient to these risks, within the context of the scenarios tested, and we \nwill continue to monitor and manage this through our enterprise-wide risk \nmanagement framework (EWRMF).\n • A priority area of focus for NatWest Group in 2022 has been the continued \nenhancement of how we incorporate climate risk into our capital adequacy \nassessment process (ICAAP) and strategic planning process. This ensures that we \nhave sufficient capital for the most material source of climate-related risk over the \ncapital planning horizon. \n • Continue to enhance scenario modelling \nand analytic capabilities.\n • Address challenges related to the availability of \ngranular, reliable and verifiable customer data.\n • Respond to developing regulatory requirements \non the approach to climate-related risk within \nthe regulatory capital regime.\n4.2a, 5.5\nTCFD: Climate-related disclosures overview continued\nGovernance Strategy\nRisk \nManagement\nMetrics and \nTargets\n(1) Our climate transition planning uses different time frames than those used in financial reporting.
