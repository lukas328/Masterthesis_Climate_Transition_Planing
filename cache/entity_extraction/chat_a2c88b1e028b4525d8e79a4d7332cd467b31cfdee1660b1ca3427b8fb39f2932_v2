A score of 2 represents use of data from customers reports without third-party verification and a score of 3 represents use of production data to estimate emissions.\n(*) Within the scope of EY assurance. Refer to page 10.\nTo estimate financed emissions by sector, we look at emissions on a customer basis. For the residential mortgages and commercial real estate sectors, we use EPC ratings to estimate emissions. For other sectors, the following \napproach is applied: \n1. Where available, we use customers’ published financed emissions to estimate NatWest Group‘s financed emissions. These are sourced from third parties who have processes in place to gather and validate this data. We also use \npublished production capacity data where available.\n2. Where published financed emissions are not available, we use other externally published financial and non-financial data to estimate emissions e.g. customer revenue data to estimate production levels or emissions based on a  \nsectoral-average revenue intensity factor. \n3. For customers for which externally published emissions or other data are not available, we estimate emissions based on the emissions for other customers in the sector, assuming that the emissions profile for customers for which \npublished data is not available, is comparable to the rest of the customers within the same sector.\nPurchased carbon offsets are not taken into consideration as part of our footprint modelling in order to provide a true reflection of emissions produced. Sequestration via our LULUCF sector is modelled in line with best practice.\nEstimates of financed emissions continued\n80NatWest Group plc | 2022 Climate-related Disclosures Report\nGovernance Strategy and Climate transition plan Risk Management and Scenario Analysis Metrics and TargetsIntroduction\nOverview of data limitations\nThere are various data limitation challenges associated with the estimation of financed emissions due to the lack \nof available, granular, reliable and verifiable customer and counterparty data. In addition, other limitations on the \nestimation of financed emissions include:\n • Lag effect of availability of customer data: While we have estimated emissions for on-balance sheet lending \nand investment at December 2021, 2020 and 2019, published customer data may not always correlate to these \ndates. We source customer data from external third parties who specialise in collating data from published \nreports. While we look at data corresponding to NatWest Group balance sheet dates for which emissions are \nbeing estimated, underlying customer data may relate to different dates. This may result in a lag in reflecting \nany changes in customer circumstances within NatWest Group’s financed emissions.\n • Decarbonisation of the power grid: Scope 2 emissions relate to emissions from purchased sources including \nelectricity. Given the UK Government’s legislated net zero 2050 target per the Climate Change Act amendment \npublished in June 2019 and the announcement in the Energy White Paper updated in December 2021 of full \ndecarbonisation of the power grid by 2035, and accelerated roll-out of offshore wind deployment, the UK is \nexperiencing rapid decarbonisation of the power grid including a decline of coal’s share as fuel for the UK \npower grid to almost zero in 2022. There may be a lag in decarbonisation of the power grid and the reporting \nby customers of the resulting reduction in Scope 2 emissions. To minimise the extent of overstatement of Scope \n2 emissions, we have adjusted for the estimated impact of decarbonisation of the power grid between the year \nof EPC assessment and year of estimation of emissions for residential mortgages and commercial real estate. \nFor other sectors, Scope 2 emissions may be overstated to the extent of benefit from power grid \ndecarbonisation since the previous reporting date of the customer.\n • Estimation of emissions based on on-balance sheet exposures: Consistent with the PCAF Standard, \nwe estimate emissions on on-balance sheet lending and investment only. As a result, commitments made to \ncustomers that haven’t been drawn by the customers at the date of calculation are excluded. This may result \nin a variation in financed emissions from year-to-year as a result of customer drawdowns and repayments.\n • Susceptibility to variation year-on-year: As noted previously, we use customer emissions, production and \nrevenue data to estimate financed emissions. Customer revenue and production are susceptible to change \nfor various reasons including most recently, the impact of COVID 19, as well as consolidation in the sector, \nchanging supply/demand market conditions, new entr\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
