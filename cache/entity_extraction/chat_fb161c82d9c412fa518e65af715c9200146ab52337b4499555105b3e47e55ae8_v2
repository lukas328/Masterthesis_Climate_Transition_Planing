A diverse and inclusive \norganisation is fundamental to our vision, and our Board Diversity Policy ensures that the \ntone is set from the top. \nAt the beginning of the year, the Committee reviewed our Board Diversity Policy and \nrefreshed its objectives to maintain:\n• 33% female representation on the Board\n• One director from an ethnic minority group. \nThroughout the year and as of 31st March 2023, these targets were successfully met. \nDetails of gender and ethnic representation as prescribed by Listing Rule 9.8.6 are set out \nin the tables on this page. The Board and GLT members confirmed their gender and ethnicity \nfor the purpose of collecting this data. \n Board Diversity Policy: matthey.com/board-diversity\nAs at 31st March 2023, the Board does not fully comply with the new board diversity targets \nset by the FCA for at least 40% of individuals on the board to be women, and for one of the \nsenior board positions (Chair, Chief Executive Officer, Senior Independent Director or Chief \nFinancial Officer) to be held by a woman. Following the appointment of Barbara as Non-\nExecutive Director on 1st July 2023 and her appointment as Senior Independent Director from \n20th July 2023, female representation on the Board will meet the FCA targets and exceed \nthose set out in our current Board Diversity Policy. \nWe are pleased that the Board’s composition meets the FCA’s ethnicity target to have one \nmember of the board from a minority ethnic group. The Committee intends to review the \nBoard Diversity Policy in 2023/24 and will set new targets. \nAll of our non-executive directors are members of each committee, which provides the most \ndiverse perspective and assists our decision making in these forums. \nThe Board also supports the terms of the Enhanced Voluntary Code of Conduct for executive \nsearch firms. All our appointed executive search firms are required to secure a diverse longlist \nof candidates, including Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic talent. \nBeyond the Board, we aspire to have gender balance across all levels of the group. One of our \nkey milestones is to achieve greater than 40% of female representation across professional \nmanagement by 2030. While gender diversity has improved, we want to accelerate the pace \nof change. Further details on how we are improving gender diversity across the group, the \ngender balance of senior management and our Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging Policy are \nset out on pages 36 to 37.\nGender representation as at 31st March 2023\nNumber of \nboard members\n% of the Board Number of \nsenior board \npositions (CEO, \nCFO, SID, Chair)\nNumber in \nexecutive \nmanagement\n% of executive \nmanagement\nMen 6 67 4 9 75\nWomen 3 33 0 3 25\nOther categories 0 0 0 0 0\nNot specified / prefer  \nnot to disclose\n0 0 0 0 0\nEthnic representation as at 31st March 2023\nNumber of \nboard members\n% of the Board Number of \nsenior board \npositions (CEO, \nCFO, SID, Chair)\nNumber in \nexecutive \nmanagement\n% of executive \nmanagement\nWhite British or other White \n(including minority-white \ngroups)\n8 89 4 10 84\nMixed/Multiple Ethnic \nGroups\n0 0 0 1 8\nAsian/Asian British 1 11 0 1 8\nBlack/African/ Caribbean/\nBlack British\n0 0 0 0 0\nOther ethnic group, \nincluding Arab\n0 0 0 0 0\nNot specified/ prefer not to say 0 0 0 0 0\nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 2023 93\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION\nNomination Committee report continued\nThe Audit Committee forms a critical part of the overall framework of corporate governance \nfor JM. We are responsible for overseeing the financial reporting, internal financial controls, \ninternal control and risk management systems, and maintaining an appropriate relationship \nwith the external auditors. \nThe Committee supports the Board by obtaining assurances that controls are working \nas designed and by challenging those assurances. We receive and consider reports from \nmanagement on the effectiveness of the systems that have been established, to ensure that \nboth JM’s management and PwC, our external auditor, are appropriately challenged and held \nto account. Management and PwC have again worked hard during 2022/23 to maintain \nthe ongoing integrity of our financial reporting, and I have continued to hold regular dialogue \nwith management, the Group Assurance and Risk Director, and PwC.\nThe last three years have seen Covid-19, the Russia/Ukraine conflict and other issues cause \npolitical and economic turmoil. This has put significant pressure on the risk environment and \ncompanies’ financial reporting processes. Accordingly, we have continued to focus on \nfinancial reporting and related internal control risks as well as ensuring the company \nmaintains a strong performance on ethics, compliance and audit quality.  \nThe focus of assurance activities during the year has been post Covid\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
