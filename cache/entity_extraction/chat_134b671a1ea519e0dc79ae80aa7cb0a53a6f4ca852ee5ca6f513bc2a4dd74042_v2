Noted below are the key policies including related abatement potential and the UK \nCCC’s assessment in 2022:\n • Low carbon heat in homes and heat networks could deliver 39% and 7% of the UK’s 2035 abatement, \nrespectively.\n • While government proposed market-based mechanism for low-carbon heat could reduce the need for \npublic funding and drive down the unit costs for heating systems, it is complex and carries “significant \nrisk”. Policy measures to stimulate demand are clearer but do not necessarily go far enough e.g. boiler \nphase-out dates, tighter standards for new buildings and limited government funding through the Boiler \nUpgrade Scheme.\n • While the £288 million of capital grant funding through the Green Heat Networks Fund (GHNF) will help \nestablish an early market till 2025, no funding is currently committed after 2025. New projects funded \nthrough GHNF will need to use low-carbon sources but there are no clear policies to require the \ndecarbonisation of existing heat networks or that prohibit the creation of new high-carbon networks which \ndo not draw on public funds.\n • Increasing energy efficiency in non fuel-poor homes and domestic product standards and appliance \nefficiency are each expected to deliver 7% of the UK’s 2035 abatement in buildings. However, the most \nsignificant policy gap in the buildings sector is energy efficiency, with only the private rented sector covered \nin the UK through a consultation on increasing the minimum standard for rental properties to EPC C by 2028. \nIn his Autumn statement, The UK Chancellor announced an ambition to reduce energy consumption by 15% \nby 2030. This is supported by the UK Government’s annual investment in measures to promote energy \nefficiency with £6 billion in the current year, to double to more than £12bn from 2025 to 2028. The UK \nGovernment has implemented a robust framework for product standards, which should contribute to emissions \nreductions over time.\n • The UK Government timeIine for increasing energy performance for fuel-poor homes: meant to provide \n5% of 2035 abatement, is rated as being “credible” for funding over the next few years, but has not set out \nwhen it will implement policies to improve the targeting of support to fuel-poor homes.\n • New buildings: From 2025 the Future Homes Standard will require new homes to meet high standards of \nfabric efficiency and use low-carbon heat sources. It is expected to deliver 6% of 2035 abatement for residential \nbuildings, 8% for commercial and 10% for public buildings. This has “significant risk” until 2024, and “some \nrisk” from 2025. The UK CCC is not confident that the interim building standards uplift will drive sufficient \nchange in the new build sector prior to 2025, as standards can be met without low-carbon heat, adding to the \nstock of boilers which will need to be retrofitted in coming years. The Government’s Net Zero Estate Playbook, \npublished late in 2022, is expected to provide greater funding and requirements to decarbonise public buildings.\n • In the construction sector, the UK Government has released its Construction Playbook guidance, with clear \nclimate-related procurement requirements for government contracts in buildings and infrastructure, which \ninclude life cycle assessments and zero waste strategies from winning contracts.\nOther external dependencies to support transition:\n • Immature supply chain to do retrofits: there is currently a lack of skilled workforce to do retrofit assessments \nand execute appropriate retrofits for different homes meaning that accredited and trusted builders and installers \nare hard to find. In addition, a lack of scale in an immature manufacturing supply chain for fabrication materials \nand technologies for retrofit results in costly materials and constrained supply.  Natwest Group is exploring how \nwe can work with the Supply Chain Sustainability School to share the knowledge and build the skills needed to \nretrofit homes across the UK.\n • Landlord/tenant relationship: within the CRE sector, depending on the scale of the retrofit, landlords may \nneed to relocate or remove tenants. While this would improve the energy efficiency of the property, it may \nimpact the credit risk profile of the landlord (NatWest Group customer) due to loss of rent.\n • Customer journey: while commercial customers are well progressed in their decarbonisation journey due to \nregulation; residential mortgage customers are in early stages of their transition journey. Further customer \neducation and engagement, as well as government policies, will support incentivising customer behaviour \nchange. To support this, NatWest Group is creating a one-stop portal where customers will be able to work out \nwhat they need to improve the energy efficiency of their home, find the finance and source a supplier.\n • Technology development and scaling: Heat pumps are considered to be more energy efficient than oil and \ngas boilers. However, installing heat\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
