Aviva’s Climate Transition Plan defines objectives\nSub-sector: Insurance\nAviva’s first iteration of its Climate Transition Plan,88 launched in March 2022, provides an explicit discussion of  \nthe company’s objectives, strategy, and priorities. This corresponds closely to the GFANZ recommendations. \nIt presents a short ambition statement that clearly specifies the company’s priority areas and scope, and contains  \nan accelerated timeframe (i.e., earlier than 2050) compared to its sub-sector alliance commitment. Aviva states:\n“We pledge to be a Net Zero company by 2040, abating the carbon emissions we produce ourselves and from \nour suppliers by 2030, from our insurance book by 2040, and from customers’ and shareholders’ investments \nby 2040.”\nFootnotes to this statement provide definitions of “corporate net zero” and “asset coverage” for readers interested \nin technical details, and a link to a web page for more information. \nUsing a simple timeline, Aviva details its roadmap, including interim climate goals and targets, with the interval \nbetween the targets shorter in the short term and longer in the long term. This shows that it has considered \nimmediate steps while allowing for regular reviews and potential adjustments to be made along the way. Aviva  \nis also preparing its science-based targets for submission to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). \nFigure 11.
