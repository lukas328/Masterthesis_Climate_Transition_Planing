continued\nSuccession planning\nThe Committee ensures we are led by a diverse, high-quality board, with the appropriate \nskills, knowledge and experience to support the group’s strategic priorities. This includes \noverseeing succession plans for all board roles. In accordance with the Code, the Committee \nmonitors the tenure of JM’s non-executive directors against the recommended nine-year term \nto ensure an orderly succession. The tenures of our non-executive directors, Senior \nIndependent Director and the Chair are on page 75.\nNon-Executive\nBy January 2024, Chris Mottershead will have achieved a nine-year tenure on the Board.  \nIn anticipation of his retirement, the Committee discussed the roles and responsibilities  \nof the board members. \nHaving reviewed the skills and expertise of the current board members, we recommended \nthat a further non-executive director be appointed to the Board as Senior Independent \nDirector. The Committee sought an individual with strong leadership experience, experience \nof delivering transformation programmes and an understanding of the US commercial \nmarket. Egon Zehnder, a third-party search and recruitment specialist, assisted with the \nsearch. Following evaluation of the final short list of candidates, the Committee \nrecommended Barbara Jeremiah’s appointment. It was felt that Barbara’s understanding of \nmetals, along with her investor experience, would enhance the Board’s deliberations.\nExecutive\nThe Committee also oversees succession planning for senior leadership roles and talent \ndevelopment to build capability for the future. Our senior leaders are a source of future GLT \nand board talent, with some of our most recent GLT appointments progressing through this \nroute. The Committee reviews, at least annually, the existing formal succession plan against \nthe internal talent pipeline of candidates, for immediate and medium to longer-term \nmovement into key leadership roles. This is routinely challenged to understand the breadth \nof potential and to balance internal succession planning with the need for external perspectives.\nDuring the year, Egon Zehnder provided senior-level recruitment services, including \nassessment and people development services. It has no other connection with the Company \nor any other directors.\nBoard skills\nWe regularly assess the Board’s collective skillset by asking each non-executive director to \nidentify their strengths, scoring their level of expertise on a scale of one to five. The table on \npage 75 shows the skills held by our non-executive directors that are most relevant to their \nrole at Johnson Matthey. This assessment helps us identify any gaps that can be addressed \nthrough future appointments or additional training.\nBoard inductions\nAll new directors receive a tailored induction programme upon joining the Board.  \nThe diagram below shows some of the key activities that are undertaken by all new \ndirectors. \nVisits to our key \nsites to meet \nemployees\nMeeting key \ncustomers\nMeeting the \nexternal \nauditor, brokers \nand company \nadvisers\nTraining on \nhealth and \nsafety and \ncompliance \ntopics\nFinancial \nbriefings\nIntroductions to \nthe businesses \nand leadership \nteams\nPre-reading \nboard and \nrelevant \ncommittee \npapers\nBriefings on \ndirectors’ duties\nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 202392\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION\nNomination Committee report continued\nDiversity and inclusion\nThe Committee continues to drive the diversity agenda across JM.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
