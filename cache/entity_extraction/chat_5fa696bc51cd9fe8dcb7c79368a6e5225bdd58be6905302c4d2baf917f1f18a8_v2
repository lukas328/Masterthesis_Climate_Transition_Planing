Consideration is also \ngiven to whether there are any factors which indicate a full out-of-cycle external revaluation is required. \nIn 2022, the external triennial revaluation of properties in the UK have been independently performed by Knight \nFrank, in Chile by Phi Partners, in Poland by Knight Frank and in Türkiye by Ekol GD. In addition, full out-of-cycle \nrevaluations have been performed in Australia by Ernst & Young and in New Zealand by Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL). \nDirectors’ property valuations have been performed across all other geographies. \nIn valuing care home property, a judgement is made on the highest and best use of the property. In the majority \nof cases this leads to the property being valued as part of a group of assets making up a going concern business, \nusing market valuations. This approach is in line with market practice. The business is valued on a fair maintainable \ntrade basis with the fair value thus calculated being allocated to plant and equipment and bed licences applicable \nat net book value (as a proxy for fair value), with the residual value being allocated to property. \nThe valuations of care homes across the Group (and hospitals in Spain and Poland) are therefore determined \nbased on a capitalisation of earnings approach. Each facility’s normalised earnings are calculated based on what \na reasonably efficient operator could be expected to achieve. This is divided by an appropriate capitalisation rate \nto determine a value in use. The capitalisation rate is the average rate of return for each facility and is based on \nqualitative and quantitative indicators of the facility’s current and future performance. \nThe valuations of hospitals and clinics in Chile are determined based on discounted future cash flow projections. \nThe discount rate is determined according to the time value of money, the level of risk of the industry and the \ncorresponding premium risk. \nUnobservable inputs include the capitalisation or discount rate and, for all properties except those in Poland \nand Chile, the average occupancy. \nAll other properties are valued by external valuers based on observable market values of similar properties. Due \nto the level of judgement and adjustments required to the observable inputs used in the valuation methodologies, \na Level 3 classification, under the fair value hierarchy in accordance with IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement, is \nconsidered appropriate for all properties in the Group. \nAt each revaluation date, accumulated depreciation is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the asset. \nSensitivity analysis \nThe significant assumptions used in the calculation of the fair values of the material Level 3 freehold properties \nin the Group are: \nNew \nFreehold properties Australia Zealand UK Spain Chile Poland \n2022 \nValuation assumptions: average occupancy rate 93.1% 91.4% 86.6% 88.4% N/A N/A \nValuation assumptions: average capitalisation/discount rate 15.1% 12.9% 8.9% 19.0% 9.0% 11.6% \nValuation assumptions: average price per square metre N/A N/A £3,389 £2,391 N/A N/A \nValuation assumptions: average yield N/A N/A 6.3% 5.2% N/A N/A \n2021 \nValuation assumptions: average occupancy rate 94.2% 90.9% 83.4% 81.0% N/A N/A \nValuation assumptions: average capitalisation/discount rate 14.0% 13.5% 10.9% 15.0% 6.9% 10.8% \nValuation assumptions: average price per square metre N/A N/A £3,977 £2,022 N/A N/A \nValuation assumptions: average yield N/A N/A 5.5% 5.0% N/A N/A \nThe valuations are most sensitive to changes in capitalisation rate assumptions, and an increase/decrease of 0.5% \nin capitalisation rates would decrease/increase the total carrying value of freehold properties by £(97)m/£89m \n(2021: £(96)m/£100m).
