In the past year I have \nbeen immensely privileged to visit many of our sites around \nthe world and see for myself the extraordinary science, \nrefining and manufacturing capabilities that have been \nthe bedrock of our company for over 200 years.\nEqually importantly, I have personally visited many of our key customers and have been \nencouraged by their feedback, but also motivated to ensure JM continues to transform \nto meet the needs of our customers and continue to lead in our chosen markets. \nDespite the global macro-economic challenges, I’m proud that Johnson Matthey has made \ngood progress in delivering on our strategy and our milestones, with results in line with \nmarket expectations. There is more detail on the strategy on pages 12-13, but I am pleased \nthat several regulatory tailwinds for renewable energy and decarbonisation mean that our \nchosen growth markets are going to be even bigger and are coming at us faster than \noriginally anticipated.\nWinning in our markets\nIn our strategy refresh in May 2022, we outlined how we would focus only on the markets \nwhere we can win, serving our customers through our four core businesses: Clean Air, PGMS,  \nCT and HT. We said we would divest businesses that are not within the core portfolio and this \nis well on track, with the divestment of Piezo Products and Diagnostic Services.\n \nOur core businesses have done very well in securing new customer commitments. Clean Air \nsecured a number of important Euro 7 targeted customer wins, including all of Mercedes \nBenz’s light duty diesel business in Europe. \nCT business achieved its commercial milestones and signed several significant licences, \nincluding H2H Saltend, one of the UK’s largest low carbon (blue) hydrogen projects. In \naddition, our FT CANS™ technology has been selected by Strategic Biofuels for their Louisana \nproject which aims to produce the world’s lowest carbon footprint liquid fuel.\nHT secured a transformational strategic partnership with Plug Power, including a co-\ninvestment in what is expected to be the largest (5GW scaling to 10GW over time) catalyst \ncoated membrane (CCM) manufacturing facility in the world.\nIn our PGMS refining business we have won new contracts with a large miner, and increased \nour market share with some key recyclers. We have also won new contracts across our \nproducts business, most notably with our pharmaceutical and agro-chemical customers.\nFinancial performance in 2022/23\nOur financial performance for the year was in line with market expectations, albeit below the \nprior year\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
