If a client does not make progress on \naddressing our requests even after a certain period of time, we carefully consider whether or not to continue our \nbusiness with them. \n  \nTCFD Report 2022  -79- \n \n3) If a client is contributing to or is directly linked with forced labor, child labor, or human trafficking, we will request a \nreport on their responses to the relevant issue, and that they take additional steps if needed. \n \n4. Policy on Transition Risk Sectors \nWe recognize that climate change is closely tied to various economic and social issues, and that addressing climate change \nis an important issue in the medium to long term. We will set policies for companies in sectors likely to be exposed to \ntransition risks associated with climate change. \n \nTargets \n Companies whose primary businesses are in coal-fired power generation, oil-fired power generation, gas-fired power \ngeneration, coal mining, oil and gas, steel, or cement. \nRisks that we should recognize \n Companies whose primary businesses are those above are at a high risk of exposure to transition risks (policy risks, \ntechnology risks, reputational risks, etc.) arising from the transition to a low-carbon society, and if their responses to \nthese transition risks are not appropriate, there is the risk of increased concern about climate change and air pollution. \nPolicies \n Based on our Environmental Policy, we are reducing the amount of greenhouse gas emissions through a medium- to \nlong-term financing and investment portfolio in order to transition in stages to a portfolio that aligns with the Paris \nAgreement goals. For that reason, we will actively engage (carry out constructive dialogue) with clients in order to \nsupport the transition to a low-carbon society and adapt to climate change, taking a medium to long term view, and in \naccordance with each client’s issues and needs. \n We will engage so as to strengthen by stages the following initiatives with clients in the transition risk sectors. \n- - Develop a strategy for a low-carbon society \n- - Set quantitative targets and/or KPIs (medium term, long term) to ensure the transition strategy is effective \n- - Take actions based on the strategy, targets, and KPIs, as well as disclose the progress \n- - Measure and disclose greenhouse gas emissions volume \n- - Enhance disclosures based on TCFD or equivalent framework \n For clients in transition risk sectors, we will specify risk categories based on the primary business of these companies \nand their transition risk response level. \n Through engagement, we will check at least once per year on the status of transition risk response, based on the \nfollowing criteria. \n- - Willingness to take measures against transition risks \n- - Development of the strategy, setting of quantitative targets \n- - Target levels, specificity of means of achievement and status of efforts, performance and objectivity, etc. \n If there is no willingness to respond to transition risks and no transition strategies have been developed by clients even \none year after the initial engagement based on the above, we make decisions on whether or not to continue our business \nwith them based on careful consideration. \n \n5. Policies on Specific Industrial Sectors \nFor certain sectors such as those listed below, where there is a high possibility of contributing to adverse environmental or \nsocial impacts, our decisions regarding whether to engage in business transactions take into consideration the client’s \nresponse to environmental and social issues, including climate change, conservation of biodiversity, and respect for human \nrights: \n1) Weapons \n We avoid providing financing or investment which will be used for the manufacture of weapons designed to kill or inflict \nstructural damage during wars or armed conflicts.
