Consequently, we seek high-quality \nESG integration across all our investment strategies.\nThe investment teams have primary responsibility for \nconsidering ESG risks in their investment analysis, identifying \nengagement priorities and deciding how to vote on them. Each \nteam integrates ESG issues in accordance with its investment \nphilosophy and processes (see table on next page). \nIn doing so, they tailor their integration approach based \non considerations including:\n ɽ The regulations and standards relevant to the region(s) \ninvested in.\n ɽ Specific risks and opportunities for different asset \nclasses, including the ability to have, and varying levers \nof, influence.\n ɽ Typical holding periods and sector exposures. \n17\nSustainability and Stewardship Report\nInvesting in our systems\nTo support ESG integration by our investment teams, during the reporting \nperiod we further developed data storage and surfacing tools to enable \nthem to analyse portfolios against relevant ESG datasets. These processes \nwere improved by working with vendors and our technology teams to \nautomate the onboarding of the datasets.\nWe also enhanced our ability to conduct climate-scenario analysis, \nonboarding a specialist solution into our systems to enable our investment \nteams to gain a deeper understanding of the physical and transition risks \nin our portfolios. We remain cautious about climate-scenario analysis and \nits accuracy, given the multitude of variables involved in climate modelling \nand the very long modelling timeframes.
