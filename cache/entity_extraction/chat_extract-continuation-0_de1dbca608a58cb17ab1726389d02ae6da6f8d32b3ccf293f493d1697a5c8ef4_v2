For 2022, 10% of potential \nannual bonus was based on performance against \nthe following climate ambitions:\n1. Maintaining 40% reduction in carbon emissions \nfrom our direct operations against 2019 \nbaseline;\n2. Providing £17.5 billion of climate and sustainable \nfunding and financing in 2022; and\n3. Developing the first iteration of our Climate \ntransition plan for publication with the 2022 \nAnnual Results.\nIn 2021, it was also agreed that the measures used \nto determine the bonus pool for the wider \nworkforce would include our climate ambitions.  \nThis ensures that the work of colleagues in \nsupporting the transition to a low carbon economy \nis being reflected in pay decisions.\nFor further detail see our Directors’ \nRemuneration Report on page 138 of the \n2022 Annual Report and Accounts.\nPerformance and remuneration\nGroup Nominations  \n& Governance Committee\nThe Group Nominations & Governance \nCommittee (N&G) considered Board and \nBoard Committee succession at all of its \nfour scheduled meetings during 2022.\nThis included consideration of Board composition to \nensure that overall balance of skills, knowledge, \nexperience and diversity on the Board is \nmaintained. In particular, N&G recommended the \nappointment of Roisin Donnelly to the Board in \n2022. As part of this process N&G considered how \nher background in customer experience, digital \ntransformation, and experience of developing ESG \nstrategies at board level would strengthen Board \nskills and diversity. N&G also recommended the \nappointment of Stuart Lewis to the Board and he \nwill join the Board in April 2023.\nN&G also considered the composition of Principal \nSubsidiary boards and approved a number of \nappointments having regard to the overall balance \nof skills, knowledge, experience and diversity on \nthose boards.\n10%\nof annual bonus for Executive Directors \nis based on performance against \nclimate ambitions\nRemCo’s focus is on setting and assessing the climate-related goals attached to ED pay.

The executive-level committees \nand cross-bank working groups shown in section 2.1 \nassist in discharging their responsibilities and support \ncollaboration across the organisation. The Group CEO \nand Group CRO oversee all executive reporting to the \nBoard and its committees on climate-related matters.\nThe Group CEO’s responsibility for strategic delivery is \ndelegated to her executive team, notably the Group \nCFO, Group CIO, Group CPTO, Director, Strategy, \nCorporate Development and Sustainability and the \nbusiness CEOs. Each has shared responsibility for \nstrategic delivery relating to financial risks and \nopportunities that arise from climate change, \nensuring NatWest Group identifies, measures, \nmonitors, manages and reports on opportunities \nas well as exposure to risks.\nThe Group CRO is responsible for ensuring that the \nfinancial risks for climate change are reflected in risk \nmanagement frameworks and – in line with our three \nlines of defence model – the Risk function provides \neffective, independent oversight of first line \nmanagement activity. The Group CRO and his \ndelegates are supported by the Climate Risk Oversight \nForum, which serves as an important engagement \nand oversight mechanism.\nOne Bank approach to integrated business \nand functional governance\nNatWest Group moved from a programme-led \napproach to climate change in 2021 to a framework \nembedded approach in 2022 within our existing \naccountability structure. Under our integrated \ngovernance structure, business areas are expected \nto ensure that climate considerations are built into \nday-to-day decision-making. See sections 3.6 and \n4.3 for examples of business areas embedding climate \nin decision-making. The accountable executives are \nempowered to take decisions within their areas of \naccountability and responsibility, with clear escalation \nand reporting routes in place to the Climate Change \nESG. As our integrated governance model evolves, \nto support accountable executives, each business area \nhas developed local governance forums to help them \nto support an adequate and integrated management \nresponse to our Climate transition plan, pursuit of \nstrategic climate opportunities and the effective \nmanagement of climate-related risks.\nTo drive a One Bank approach across all business \nareas, several cross-bank climate-related forums \nprovide strategic insight and specific expertise, and \nhave supported the development of the Climate \ntransition plan. These forums are shown in section 2.1:\n • Climate Opportunities Group: facilitates the \nperformance and growth across our five key \nclimate themes (Clean Energy, Clean Transport, \nClean Buildings, Green Finance, Carbon-Tracking \nand Behaviours);\n • Measurement and Reporting Steering Group: \nleads the coordination of NatWest Group’s Climate \ntransition plan.
