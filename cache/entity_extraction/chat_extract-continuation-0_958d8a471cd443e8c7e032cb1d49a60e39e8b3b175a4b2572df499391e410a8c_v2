companies in the targeted sectors are facing and \nwhich relate to  demand, pric es, tighter regulations, and similar . In order to evaluate the risks and opportunities, we defined \nparameters using the projections from the NGFS scenarios, as well as publicly disclosed data from our cli ents. Using said data, \nwe then analyzed changes in Mizuhoâ s credit costs by formulating an outlook for the impact on clients â financial results (Figure \n10). \n \n  \nCarbon prices Global power generation\nGlobal energy consumption Global crude steel production\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n2020 2025 2030 2035 2040 2045 2050\nCoal Oil and gas Renewable energy and other\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n600\n700\n800\n2020 2025 2030 2035 2040 2045 2050\nCurrent Policies Delayed Transition\nBelow 2Â°C Net Zero 2050\n1,000\n1,200\n1,400\n1,600\n1,800\n2,000\n2,200\n2020 2025 2030 2035 2040 2045 2050\nCurrent Policies Delayed Transition\nBelow 2Â°C Net Zero 2050\n(USD/tCO2) (EJ)\n(Mt)\nValues for Current Policies, Delayed Transition, Below \n2Â°C, Net Zero 2050 Scenarios (from left to right)\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n600\n2020 2025 2030 2035 2040 2045 2050\nCoal Oil Gas Biomass Hydrogen\n(EJ)\nValues for Current Policies, Delayed Transition, Below \n2Â°C, Net Zero 2050 Scenarios (from left to right)\nSource: NGFS, REMIND model \n\n  \nTCFD Report 2022  -43- \n \nc. Scenario analysis results \n(a) Results of credit cost calculation \nThe increase in credit cost s by 2050 is calculated assuming that exposure remains at the same level as on March 31, 2022 \nthrough 2050. \n \nCompared to the Current Policies scenario, which assumes that only currently implemented policies are preserved, the respective \nestimated increases in credit cost s of the Net Zero 2050, Below 2Â°C, and Delayed Transition scenarios are Â¥1.19 trillion, Â¥60 \nbillion, and Â¥1.1 trillion. While this does, at most, amount to an increase in credit costs of over Â¥1 trillion, that number represents \nthe cumulative amount up until 2050, and we concluded that the financial impact on our group would be limited. \n \nFor steel, the newly added target sector, the cost that accompanies decarbonization is larger than that of other sectors. It is thought \nthat, in certain conditions, the sector could suffer a large financial impact. Not just in the steel sector, but across all sectors, there \nare moderate cost s accompanying decarbonization. For an orderly decarbonization process for our clients, we believe it is \nimportant for there to be public discussion about the costs. Mizuho will work together with stakeholders and support our clients in \ntheir transitions through our business activities across regions and economies, industry groups, and initiatives. \n \nBoth the Below 2Â°C and the Delayed Transition scenarios see temperature rises limited to below 2Â°C. However, there is a major \ndifference in the results of our credit cost calculations for the two scenarios . While the Below 2Â°C scenario assumes that the \nimplementation of climate ch ange countermeasures will be efficient  and smooth (orderly transition), the Delayed Transition \nscenario assumes that countermeasures will be delayed until 2030, and will then be implemented rapidly from 2030 (disorderly \ntransition). We calculated that cred it costs for the Delayed Transition scenario will drastically exceed those of the Below 2Â°C \nscenario in the post\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MIZUHO FINANCIAL GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Mizuho Financial Group is a major financial institution involved in credit risk analysis, scenario planning, and supporting clients' transition to low-carbon economies, as detailed in their TCFD report and scenario analysis.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NGFS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) is an international network of central banks and financial supervisors that develops climate scenario parameters and models to assess transition risks and opportunities related to climate change.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REMIND<|>ORGANIZATION<|>REMIND is a climate and energy system model used by NGFS to project scenarios such as Below 2Â°C, Net Zero 2050, and others, providing data on energy consumption, emissions, and costs.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CO2<|>GEO<|>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a greenhouse gas emitted from fossil fuel combustion, contributing to climate change, with emissions projected to persist even in 2050.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FOSSIL FUELS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Fossil fuels, including coal, oil, and natural gas, are primary energy sources that account for a significant portion of energy consumption and emissions, with their use declining but still present in 2050.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STEEL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Steel is a sector analyzed for its production, investment, and decarbonization costs, with projections indicating increased costs due to climate policies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VEHICLES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Vehicles, including EVs (electric vehicles) and FCVs (fuel cell vehicles), are analyzed in terms of sales, market share, and the costs associated with transitioning to cleaner transportation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ELECTRIC UTILITIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Electric utilities are involved in energy generation and are impacted by shifts toward renewable energy and decarbonization efforts.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OIL AND GAS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Oil and gas companies are part of the energy sector affected by climate policies, with their consumption and emissions being key factors in scenario analyses.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CEO<|>PERSON<|>The CEO message in the report provides strategic overview, governance, risk management, and outlook on transition risks and opportunities related to climate change.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCENARIO ANALYSIS<|>EVENT<|>Scenario analysis involves projecting future climate and economic conditions under different policy and transition pathways, such as Below 2Â°C and Net Zero 2050 scenarios, to assess financial impacts.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLIMATE POLICIES<|>EVENT<|>Climate policies include regulations, carbon pricing, and measures aimed at reducing emissions, influencing sectors like steel, energy, and transportation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRANSITION RISK<|>EVENT<|>Transition risk refers to financial risks arising from the transition to a low-carbon economy, including costs of decarbonization and regulatory changes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CREDIT COSTS<|>EVENT<|>Credit costs are financial metrics affected by climate scenarios, with projections indicating potential increases due to climate-related risks by 2050.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NGFS<|>REMIND<|>NGFS uses REMIND model to develop climate scenarios and projections<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MIZUHO FINANCIAL GROUP<|>NGFS<|>Mizuho uses NGFS scenario parameters for its risk analysis and scenario planning<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MIZUHO FINANCIAL GROUP<|>CLIMATE POLICIES<|>Mizuho assesses the impact of climate policies on its clients and credit costs<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MIZUHO FINANCIAL GROUP<|>SCENARIO ANALYSIS<|>Mizuho conducts scenario analysis to evaluate financial impacts under different climate pathways<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CO2<|>FOSSIL FUELS<|>Fossil fuels emit CO2 when burned, contributing to climate change<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STEEL<|>CLIMATE POLICIES<|>Decarbonization policies impact the steel sector, increasing costs and influencing emissions<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VEHICLES<|>ELECTRIC UTILITIES<|>Electric utilities supply energy for electric vehicles and are affected by the shift to renewable energy<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OIL AND GAS<|>CLIMATE POLICIES<|>Oil and gas companies are impacted by policies aimed at reducing fossil fuel consumption<|>7)\n##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
