In total, our 2021 emissions were 571,885 Tons of CO2e. \nThe vast majority of our emissions arise from the products and services  \nwe buy.\n2021 emissions \nCategory Absolute emissions \n(tCO2e)\nEmissions per FTE\n(tCO2e/FTE)\nScope 1 1,000 0.04\nScope 2 (market-based) 3,138 0.13\nScope 3 - purchased goods and services 550,861 22.86\nScope 3 - other including business travel 16,885 0.70\nTotal Group carbon footprint (tCO2e) 571,885 23.74\n*This table shows all emissions and a total using the 2021 headcount.\nLSEG CLIMATE TRANSITION PLAN 202212\nCONTENTS\nOur emissions\nWe continued to reduce our total Group carbon footprint in 2021, down \nalmost 13% from our 2019 baseline, and over 10% down from 2020. We saw \nreductions across Scopes 1, 2 and 3 with the greatest percentage reductions \nin Scope 2 market-based emissions, down 69% from the 2019 baseline.  \nThis is largely due to all electricity in 2021 either being sourced from a green \ntariff or covered by an energy attribute certificate.\nScope 1 emissions reduced by 54% from our 2019 baseline, largely due to a \nreduction of our office footprint and office use.\nOverall Scope 3 emissions reduced, due largely to lower levels of business \ntravel due to the ongoing global pandemic; emissions from business travel in \n2021 were down 93% from 2019, and 66% from 2020 levels.\nAs travel restrictions begin to ease, we anticipate business travel,  \nand associated emissions, to increase from the levels seen in 2021.\nAs office occupancy levels remained low during 2021 we saw reduced \nScope 3 emissions from waste disposal. This is expected to increase as more \nemployees return to the office. We aim to manage these expected increases \nin order to stay on track with our 2030 target commitment.\nWhile we saw lower emissions from reduced business travel and office \noccupancy in 2021, we experienced a significant increase in emissions from \nhomeworking from 2019 levels. However, 2021 emissions for homeworking \nare lower than 2020 levels which is largely due to improvements in office \nattendance data which tracked actual daily attendance for each office. \nOur approach enabled us to calculate more accurate emissions data for \nhomeworking and commuting and reduced our reliance on estimated office \noccupancy figures. In previous years, a conservative estimate was made for \nboth commuting and homeworking. \nThe vast majority (96%) of our greenhouse gas emissions arise from Scope 3 \npurchased goods and services, demonstrating how critical engagement with \nour suppliers is to the overall reduction of our emissions. \nAs a result, we have set a target which aims to ensure that suppliers \nresponsible for 67% of our Scope 3 emissions (purchased goods and \nservices) set science-based targets by 2026. As part of our engagement with \nsuppliers to achieve our target, we will collect greenhouse gas emissions data \nfrom our key suppliers to more accurately calculate our emissions associated \nwith the goods and services we buy. This will allow us to set targets in the \nnear future to reduce this portion of our emissions in alignment with our net \nzero commitment. \nCONTENTS\nMethodology and verification statement\nWe report all of the emission sources required under the Companies  \nAct 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ Reports) Regulations 2013.  \nThese sources fall within our consolidated statement.\nWe do not have responsibility for any emission sources that are not included \nin our consolidated statement.\nOur emissions are calculated according to an operational control boundary \nusing GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (revised \nedition) and UK Government Environmental Reporting Guidelines: including \nstreamlined energy and carbon reporting guidance (March 2019). London \nStock Exchange Group’s Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions disclosed in this report \nhave been externally verified by Cameron-Cole against the requirements of \nthe WRI/WBCSD GHG Protocol, GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and \nReporting Standard (revised edition), GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance:  \nAn amendment to the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard, and the GHG \nProtocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope3) Standard.
