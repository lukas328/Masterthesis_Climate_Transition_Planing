Guidance on Use of Sectoral Pathways for Financial Institutions , 2022.\nBOX 2. SECTORAL PATHWAYS FOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS50 \nAn orderly transition to net zero entails the continued availability of essential goods and services \nto the global economy while replacing high-emitting technologies with low-emitting or carbon-free \nalternatives. This requires reimagining the technologies and sometimes business models of certain \nsectors such that the carbon intensity and absolute emissions of those sectors decline over time. The \nnature of that shift, including its pace and related economic activities, is referred to as a âpathway.â \nSectoral pathways provide the link between the science of the remaining carbon budget and the \ndetailed steps that a specific sector could take to reduce GHG emissions to a particular level in a \nspecified timeframe.  \nGFANZâs report Guidance on Use of Sectoral Pathways for Financial Institutions is intended as a \nguide to support financial institutionsâ use of sectoral pathways in creating net-zero transition plans; \nin aligning of their portfolios; and in engaging with real-economy firms. By providing a framework \nfor comparing pathways by commonly referenced providers (e.g., IPCC, IEA, OECM, MPP), financial \ninstitutions can understand the assumptions and outputs of the different pathways and choose the \npathways most appropriate for their net-zero objectives. The framework ensures they understand \nthe types, timeframes, and scale of investments they may need to make or discontinue. GFANZ will \nsupplement this report with sector-specific reports that will include analyses of net-zero, 1.5 degrees \nC-aligned pathways.\nPathway developers can also use the insights provided in the report to improve the usability of  \ntheir pathways. \nCONTENTS  |  FINANCIAL INSTITUTION NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLANS â FUNDAMENTALS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND GUIDANCE\n12\nGFANZâs program of work will help further \nadoption and clarify what financing is in \nfurtherance of the net-zero transition, including \nresources and considerations on transition plans for \nreal-economy firms ,51 sectoral pathways,52 managed \nphaseout,53 and portfolio alignment measurement ;54 \npromoting more ambitious climate policy from \ngovernments;55 and increasing the accessibility of \nclimate transition data, including better information \non transition-related capital allocation, through \nsupport of a new open data public utility. 56 \nGFANZ recognizes that financial institutions \nimplementing the recommendations and guidance \ncontained in this report will face challenges. The \nprivate financial sectorâs actions will influence \nthe pace and shape of the transition but will be \nmore effective with ambitious policy action from \ngovernments in line with the net-zero pledges they \nhave made. Additional action may be needed from \ngovernment and other actors in the ecosystem, \nparticularly relating to business with or investment \nin high-emitting sectors and emerging markets and \ndeveloping economies. Progress is needed in these \nareas, among others:\nâ¢ more granular and fit-for-purpose regional \nand sectoral pathways, to identify priorities for \npublic policy and investment opportunities in \nclimate solutions and to better inform net-zero \nalignment for specific real-economy companies \nand activities;\nâ¢ higher-ambition public policy to accelerate the \ntransition e.g., climate disclosure that includes \ntransition plans, taxonomies, and clarity on  \n \n51 GFANZ.
