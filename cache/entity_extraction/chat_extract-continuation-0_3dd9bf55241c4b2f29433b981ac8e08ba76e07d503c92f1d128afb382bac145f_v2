To make the pathway to reaching this goal more tangible, we are \npressing forward with setting mid-term targets (to be reached by FY2030). \n \nWe have already set a mid-term target for the electric power sector.

Every fiscal year we will examine our progress \nfrom the previous fiscal year, the external business environment, and other factors, review our action plan based on the findings \nof our examination, and steadily advance our initiatives. Our FY2022 action plan is shown below. \n \nStarting with our newly established Climate Change Response Taskforce and working groups, we will continue to strengthen and \naccelerate our response to climate change across the whole group, and will pursue contributions to achieving a low-carbon society, \nand high corporate value for both Mizuho and our clients. \n \nTable 15: FY2022 action plan \nGovernance • Strengthen and accelerate our business execution line ’s initiatives to carry out our Net Zero \nTransition Plan and report to the supervisory line. \n• Build a response framework based on disclosure regulation trends. \nStrategy • Further improve our ability to provide both financial and non-financial solutions based on client \nengagement. \n• Initiatives aimed at quantifying the financial impacts (risks and opportunities) that accompany climate \nchange. \n• Expand our scenario analysis to more sectors. \n• Conduct scenario analysis based on internal and external industrial expertise and clients ’ transition \nplans. \nRisk management • Implement appropriate risk management frameworks that takes into account the trends of regulatory \nauthorities around the world. \n• Improve the process for identifying risks and introduce a trial initiative aimed at risk identification and \nquantification. \n• Improve the control policy and exposure plan for carbon-related sectors. \n• Clarify and improve the requirements for providing business structure transformation support. \n• Revise our policy for financing and investment activity  so that it suitably reflects the state of  \nenvironmental and social issues. \nMetrics and \ntargets \n• Gradually set sector -specific mid -term Scope 3 (GHG emissions from financing and investment) \ntargets. \n• Reflect sector-specific mid -term Scope 3 targets in  detailed plans and measures for achieving \ntargets. \n• Implement measures for reducing our own GHG emissions, such as shifting to electricity produced \nby renewable energy. \n \n7. Conclusion \n  \nTCFD Report 2022  -69- \n \n \n1. Details of measurement standards for Scope 3 emissions \n(1) Formulas and measurement processes by asset class \na.

Other data comes from Mizuho’s own credit data. \n The PCAF Standard allows for estimating financed emissions by multiplying the amount of financing and investment \nin the company by the emission factor s for the sector per unit of asset  from the PCAF database (equi valent to data \nquality score (“score”) 5) when it is not possible to calculate the attribution factor due to missing data. However, when \nwe estimated financed emissions using this method, we found significant gaps between the estimates and companies’ \ndisclosed values, which could affec t the accuracy of the measurement results. Because of this, we refrained from \nusing estimates equivalent to score 5, and financed emissions for which we were not able to calculate an attribution \nfactor remain unmeasured. \n GHG emissions (company emissions) \nWe prioritized data in the following order when calculating Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. \n Data vendor data (Bloomberg), company disclosure data, company interview data (equivalent to score 1 when \ncertified by a third party, score 2 when not). \n When the above were not available, we multiplied the emission factor s for the sector per unit of revenue from the \nPCAF database (calculated by region and sector) by the company’s sales to estimate GHG emissions (equivalent to \nscore 4). \n                                         \n25 Combined figures for the loan balances of Mizuho Bank and Mizuho Trust & Banking. This includes foreign exchange assets, acceptances, \nand guarantees. It does not include available credit under committed lines of credit, securities, derivatives, and similar. Loans to special \npurpose vehicles for securitization, trade finance, and sovereign loans are outside the scope of this measurement, as it is not possible to \ncalculate an attribution factor for them. \n8.
