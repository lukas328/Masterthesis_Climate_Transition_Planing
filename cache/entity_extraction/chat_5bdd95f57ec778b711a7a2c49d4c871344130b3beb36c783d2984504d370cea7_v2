It is \nfunded through retained earnings and borrowings. The Group’s capital \nmanagement objective is to maintain sufficient capital to protect the \ninterests of its customers, investors, regulators and trading partners \nwhile deploying capital efficiently and managing risk to enable Bupa \nto continue to deliver its purpose in a sustainable manner. All profits \nare reinvested to develop the Group’s business for the benefit of \ncurrent and future customers. \nThe Solvency II framework, which governs industry regulation and prudential capital requirements within the \nEuropean Union and the UK, became effective from 1 January 2016. The Group has prepared its reporting in line \nwith the requirements of the SII regime, as enacted in the UK, following the UK's exit from the European Union. \nThe Group is subject to the requirements of Solvency II and it must hold sufficient capital to cover its Group \nSolvency Capital Requirement (SCR), which takes account of the risks in the Group, including those related \nto non-insurance businesses. \nThe Group SCR is calculated in accordance with the Standard Formula specified under Solvency II. Bupa has \nobtained approval from the PRA to substitute the insurance premium risk parameter in the Standard Formula \nwith a Group Specific Parameter (GSP) which reflects Bupa’s own loss experience. \nThe capital positions of the Group and its regulated insurance entities are kept under constant review and these \nare reported quarterly to the Board. \nThe Group’s capital resources are managed in line with the Group Capital Management Policy. While the Group \nis subject to the Solvency II requirements at a consolidated level, all regulated entities within the Group maintain \nsufficient capital resources to meet any minimum capital requirement required by respective local regulators. \nIn addition, the Group and its regulated entities are required to maintain a buffer over the regulatory minimum \nrequirements in line with their capital risk appetites. During the year, the Group and its regulated entities complied \nwith all external capital requirements. The ability of the Group’s regulated entities to transfer funds to parent \nentities is subject to local solvency requirements. \nThe Group has target ranges for solvency, leverage and interest cover ratios with a view to maintaining a \nstrong long-term senior credit rating for Bupa Finance plc with Fitch and Moody’s. The Group as a whole is not \nrated by any rating agency. Individual debt issues and certain subsidiaries within the Group have public ratings. \nAt least annually, the Group carries out an\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
