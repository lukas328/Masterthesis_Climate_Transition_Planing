Following on from our assessment in 2021, in 2022 we began to carry out \ndetailed site resilience assessments on our top ten highest risk manufacturing locations. \nWe will continue this throughout 2023 to determine the requirements for areas we need \nto focus on in the short, medium and long term.\nIntegrating those risks\nThrough our enterprise risk framework, climate-related risks and opportunities are integrated \ninto our strategic decision making. Climate change considerations are part of how we \noperate, and climate is included in our bottom-up operational risk management process, \nproviding a clear view of climate-related risks across the organisation. \nManaging those risks\nThe Sustainability Council oversees our sustainability strategy, including managing our \nclimate-related risks. These risks may have a direct or indirect impact on our principal risks \nand are therefore managed alongside and integrated within our principal risk process. \nTo drive consistency, each of our climate risks has been assigned a risk owner and sponsor as \nper our principal risk approach. These individuals are senior stakeholders who are accountable \nfor reviewing, monitoring and assessing the magnitude of the risk as well as overseeing the \nimplementation of appropriate mitigations.\nAll of our principal risks are reviewed formally, twice a year, by the GLT and the Board. \nIn the coming year, we aim to develop detailed mitigation plans for each identified climate \nrisk with distinct intermediary goals.\n For more information on our risk management approach, please see pages 62-69\nPreparing for weather-related issues at our sites\nLast year, we completed a global review \nof our assets to assess the degree of \nexposure to physical climate risks and \nidentify the high-risk sites. This year, we \nselected one of those high-risk sites, in \nthe UK, and worked with a 3rd party to \nconduct a more detailed climate change \nrisk assessment. The assessment covered \nthe site, buildings and processes, and \nassessed the likely impact from climate \nchange now and in future years. The \nclimate risk assessment identified several \nclimate hazards, and a total of 31 risks. \nThe highest risks were associated with \nsurface-water flooding and damage \nfrom high winds. Several measures for \nadaption and mitigation have since been \nimplemented at the site, which address \nthose high-priority risks, and the  \nlower- priority risk actions have been \nincorporated into the ongoing site \nmaintenance plans. Further rollout  \nof these climate change risk assessments \nwill be planned at strategic sites  \nthis year.   \nJohnson Matthey | Annual Report and Accounts 2023 51\nSTRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION\nTask Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures continued\nMetrics and targets\nThe metrics and targets we use to help us manage our climate risks and opportunities effectively are shown below.
