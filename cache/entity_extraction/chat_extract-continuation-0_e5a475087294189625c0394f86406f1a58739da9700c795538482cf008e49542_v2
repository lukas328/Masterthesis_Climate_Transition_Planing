While the Below 2Â°C scenario assumes that the \nimplementation of climate ch ange countermeasures will be efficient  and smooth (orderly transition), the Delayed Transition \nscenario assumes that countermeasures will be delayed until 2030, and will then be implemented rapidly from 2030 (disorderly \ntransition). We calculated that cred it costs for the Delayed Transition scenario will drastically exceed those of the Below 2Â°C \nscenario in the post-2030 period in particular. \n \n(b) Actions going forward \nThe results of our analysis have reaffirmed the importance of society conducting an orderly transition. Going forward, Mizuho will \nstrengthen our efforts as follows. \n(1) In-depth engagement with clients (See page 31 for details about client engagement) \n(2) Support for business structure transformation through sustainable finance and other means \n(3) Participation in policy engagement that includes private-public partnerships \n \nMizuho undertakes engagement with clients and requests that they share their transition strategies. Through this engagement, \nwe confirm the status of our clients â transition strategies and provide clients with support that facilitates the execution of said \nstrategies, such as sustainable finance. Furthermore, by participating in policy engagement, we support national governments in \ntheir implementation of policies that lead to an orderly transition. \n \nAlso, we recognize that there is no internationally agreed upon methodology for scenario analysis and that each firm and \norganization is advancing their initiatives by a trial-and-error approach. We will continue to keep on top of global trends by engaging \nin discussions with regulatory authorities and external experts, and by participating in the UNEP FI working groups . While \nleveraging the expertise of our research and credit divisions, we will continue to expand the target of our sector-specific scenario \nanalysis. We will consider conducting scenario analysis based on individual transition plans to enable closer engagement with our \nclients, and we will strive to improve available analytical methods going forward. \n \n  \nCEO message\nOverview/Introduction\nGovernance\nStrategy\nRisk management\nMetrics and targets\nConclusion\nAppendix\n \n-44- Mizuho Financial Group \n \nFigure 10: Transition risk analysis process and results \n  \n \n  \nDifference with Current Policies Scenario\nNet Zero 2050: Â¥1.19 trillion\nBelow 2Â°C: Â¥60 billion\nDelayed Transition: Â¥1.11 trillion\nAnalysis \nmethod\nAnalysis \nresults\nSelect the critical risks and opportunities that companies \nface in each sector, such as those related to demand, price, \nand tighter regulations\nDefine parameters in order to quantitatively measure the \nimpacts in A., using the NGFS scenarios and publicly \navailable information from sample companies\nEstimate the sample companiesâ future balance \nsheets/profit & loss statements and evaluate business \ncontinuity under the scenario\nExpand the C. evaluation to each of the sectorâs subsectors, \ndivided by region and other categories, and estimate credit \ncosts for the entire sector\nA.

Targets of analysis \nPhysical risk consists of acute risks (wind - and water -related damages from typhoons and other storms) and chronic risks \n(increase in heatstroke and infectious disease, rising sea levels, droughts, etc.). In our last analysis, we confirmed that chronic \nrisks are limited in nature. This time, we measured acute risks by including Mizuho group assets (buildings, equipment) as targets \nof analysis (Table 8). \nTable 8: Targets of physical risk scenario analysis \n Previous Current (underlines indicate changes) \nPhysical risk (Japan) \nAcute \nrisks \nDirect impacts \n(Impact on asset value) Mortgaged real estate (buildings) - Mizuho group assets (buildings, equipment) \n- Mortgaged real estate (buildings) \nIndirect impacts \n(Impact of business \nstagnation) \nNumber of days of corporate activity \nbusiness stagnation \nNumber of days of corporate activity business \nstagnation \nChronic risks \n- Number of people who contract \ninfectious diseases (malaria, dengue) \nand heatstroke, number of deaths \n- Working hours of outdoor laborers \n- Number of people who contract infectious \ndiseases (malaria, dengue) and heatstroke, \nnumber of deaths \n- Working hours of outdoor laborers \n \nb. Scenario and analysis methodology \nWe collaborated with a consulting firm to conduct our analysis on physical risk. (Acute risks were analyzed as per the NGFS \nscenarios. Chronic risks were analyzed as per the IPCC scenarios.) (Figure 11). \n \nRegarding acute risks, we used a Monte Carlo simulation to analyze the impacts of wind- and water-related damage from typhoons \nand other storms. For direct impacts, we analyzed damage to Mizuho group assets  and credit costs from loss or damage of \nmortgaged real estate. For indirect impacts, we analyzed credit costs from business stagnation among our clients due to wind- \nand water-related damage. \n \nIn regard to chronic risks, we accounted for the rise in average temperatures causing increases in infectious disease (e.g. malaria, \ndengue) and heatstroke as well as for heatstroke prevention practices causing concomitant decreases in summer working hours \namong outdoor laborers\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MIZUHO FINANCIAL GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Mizuho Financial Group is a major financial institution involved in banking, asset management, and financial services, actively engaging in climate risk analysis and sustainable finance initiatives)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNEP FI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative, a global partnership between UNEP and the financial sector to promote sustainable finance and climate risk management)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NGFS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Network for Greening the Financial System, a group of central banks and supervisors working to enhance climate-related financial stability)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CEO<|>PERSON<|>The CEO of Mizuho Financial Group, responsible for strategic leadership and overseeing initiatives related to climate risk and sustainable finance)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JAPAN<|>GEO<|>Country where Mizuho operates and where physical risk analysis targets are focused, particularly regarding acute risks like storms and floods)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Mizuho Assets<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Assets owned by Mizuho, including buildings and equipment, analyzed for physical risks such as wind and water damage)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Physical Risk<|>EVENT<|>Risks related to physical impacts of climate change, including acute risks like storms and chronic risks like rising temperatures, affecting assets and operations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Climate Change Countermeasures<|>EVENT<|>Actions and policies implemented to mitigate climate change impacts, with scenarios assuming either efficient (orderly) or delayed (disorderly) transition)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Scenario Analysis<|>EVENT<|>Methodology used to evaluate future impacts of climate change on financial assets and sectors, including physical and transition risks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Transition Scenarios<|>EVENT<|>Different pathways such as Below 2Â°C, Delayed Transition, and Net Zero 2050, used to assess potential credit costs and risks for sectors and companies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Policy Engagement<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Activities involving collaboration with governments and private-public partnerships to support an orderly transition to a low-carbon economy)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Sustainable Finance<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Financial activities aimed at supporting environmentally sustainable projects and business transformations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Credit Costs<|>EVENT<|>Financial impacts representing potential losses due to physical damages or transition risks under different climate scenarios)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Monte Carlo Simulation<|>EVENT<|>Statistical method used to analyze impacts of wind- and water-related damage from storms on assets and business operations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IPCC Scenarios<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scenarios used to analyze chronic climate risks such as heatstroke and infectious diseases)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Physical Risk Analysis<|>EVENT<|>Assessment of potential damages and business impacts due to climate-related physical events, including direct asset damage and business stagnation)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MIZUHO FINANCIAL GROUP<|>UNEP FI<|>Mizuho engages with UNEP FI to participate in discussions and initiatives on sustainable finance<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MIZUHO FINANCIAL GROUP<|>NGFS<|>Mizuho collaborates with NGFS for climate risk analysis and to align with global financial stability efforts<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MIZUHO FINANCIAL GROUP<|>JAPAN<|>Mizuho operates within Japan, focusing on physical risk assessments relevant to the country<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MIZUHO FINANCIAL GROUP<|>Physical Risk<|>Mizuho assesses physical risks to its assets and operations due to climate change<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MIZUHO FINANCIAL GROUP<|>Scenario Analysis<|>Mizuho uses scenario analysis to evaluate future climate-related financial risks<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MIZUHO FINANCIAL GROUP<|>Policy Engagement<|>Mizuho participates in policy engagement activities to support an orderly transition<|>7)\n##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
