Further impairment charges were also recognised in relation to parts of the Battery Materials business reflecting \nelements of the contract to sell the business to EV Metals Group.  \nOn 3rd May 2023 the group announced the sale of its Diagnostic Services business to Sullivan Street Partners. The business is presented as held for sale (refer to note 26) at fair value less estimated \ncosts to sell.
