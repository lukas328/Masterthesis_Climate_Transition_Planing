Coal power \nplants produce one-fifth of global GHG emissions.135 \nScopes 1, 2, and 3 emissions from the oil and gas \nsector represent between 33% and 40% of global \nGHG emissions.136 Bodies such as the IEA and IPCC \nagree that the rapid shift away from fossil fuels \nis critical to achieving net zero, with widely used \npathways projecting a significant decline in the use \nof coal, oil, and gas through 2050.137 \nHalting deforestation is a priority because forests \nabsorb vast amounts of carbon dioxide and forest \nloss both eliminates carbon sinks and contributes \ndirectly to GHG emissions. 138 Approximately 22% of \nthe worldâ€™s emissions stem from land-use activity, \nincluding logging, deforestation, and farming, \nand half of that from deforestation. 139 Agreements \nrelated to phasing out coal and methane and \nhalting deforestation were spotlighted at COP26 \nand the Glasgow Climate Pact included a specific \nfocus on fossil fuels, non-COâ‚‚ gases, and nature  \nand ecosystems.140, 141\nRecommendation\nEstablish and apply policies and conditions on \npriority sectors and activities, such as thermal \ncoal, oil and gas, and deforestation.

Policies \nmay also draw from sectoral decarbonization \npathways, where available, to ground the \nconditions in a robust, credible methodology 142  \nand best available information on how to manage   \nan orderly phaseout. 143 \nPolicies and conditions should be regularly \nreviewed and updated. This should include \nevaluating progress against policy timelines and \nobjectives, reflecting updates in data availability, \nand considering scientific understanding.\n142 GFANZ.

The Managed Phaseout of High-emitting Assets , 2022.\nIn their policies, institutions should consider \nincluding a clear objective connected to net zero; \na definition of the sectors and activities to which \nthe policy applies; conditions and standards for \nongoing business engagement; details of any \nrestrictions or exclusions that apply; and relevant \ntimelines. As well, the policy should be transparent. \nTable 4 sets out the potential policy elements \nand a description of examples of what they might \ninclude. If companies are unable or unwilling to \nmeet the conditions and standards after suitable \nengagement, financial institutions should consider \nhaving an escalation process.\nSee Policy examples section in the Financial \nInstitution Net-zero Transition Plans â€” \nSupplemental Information  report for an in-\ndepth discussion and examples of thermal coal, \noil and gas, and deforestation policies and \nconditions in the financial sector.\nTable 4. Elements in policies on emissions-intensive assets/activities â€” Considerations\nELEMENT DESCRIPTION\nObjective The overarching goal of the policy, how it supports implementation of the institutionâ€™s net-zero \ntransition ambition and priorities, and how it is informed by science. \nScope The type of company, asset, project, and/or activity, as well as the consideration across the \nsupply chain, to which the policy applies. Examples include companies whose share of revenue \ngenerated by specific activity (e.g., coal-fired power) exceed a threshold, a list of specific project \ntypes (e.g., gas pipelines), or geographies (e.g., the Amazon Basin).\nScope could include the types of business activities within the financial institution (e.g., lending, \nunderwriting, investing, advising, services) to which the policy applies, with the aim to cover the \nwhole business where feasible over  time.\nConditions Criteria or conditions consistent with a science-based net-zero transition and under which \nthe financial institution provides products and services within the activities, geographies, and \nsectors/business areas defined in the policy. For instance, the institutionâ€™s policy could require \nmore extensive due diligence on particular clients or portfolio companies, or a transition or \nmanaged phaseout plan. 144 Engagement programs may focus on influencing companies to \ndecarbonize operations.\nIMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY\nCONTENTS  |  FINANCIAL INSTITUTION NET-ZERO TRANSITION PLANS â€” FUNDAMENTALS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND GUIDANCE\n54\nELEMENT DESCRIPTION\nExclusions Specific prohibited companies, assets, projects, and/or activities that cannot be served or \nfinanced by the financial institution upon conditions not being met.\nExamples include the prohibition of services or financing to entities in scope that do not have \nmitigation plans or whose activities involve expansion of high-emitting sources. Any exclusions \nwhich a financial institution chooses to apply should be informed by science-based pathways and \ndetermined unilaterally.\nTimelines A roadmap for the transition to net zero\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
