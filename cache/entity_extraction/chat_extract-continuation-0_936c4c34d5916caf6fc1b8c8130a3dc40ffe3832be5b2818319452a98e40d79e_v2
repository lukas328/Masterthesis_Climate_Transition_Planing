Uncertainty around both the amount and timing of future \noutflows arises as a result of variations in employee retention rates, which may vary based on historical experience. \nThe annual leave provision relates to territories where the annual entitlement of leave is not required to be taken \nwithin a predetermined time nor does it expire. Therefore, uncertainty exists around the timing of future outflows \nas well as around the amount of future outflows due to wage inflation. \nCustomer remediation and legal provisions \nCustomer remediation provisions relate to the costs of compensating customers for losses or damages associated \nwith a failure to comply with regulations or to treat customers fairly. Legal provisions relate to potential and \nongoing legal claims and represent the discounted fair value of total estimated liabilities. Due to the nature of \nthese provisions, the timing and potential cost are uncertain. \nInsurance provisions \nInsurance provisions are in respect of the Group’s self insurance and cover the excess that arises on claims made \nin relation to losses arising from damage to property, business interruption and medical, employee or public \nliability. Any outflows relating to this provision are dependent on the frequency and value of claims submitted \nas well as the excess amount specified within individual policies with insurers. The fund is actuarially assessed \ntwice a year to ensure that the provision is adequate. \nBupa Annual Report 2022 178 \n     \n                \n                \n              \n  \n                    \n                  \n                   \n         \n    \n                   \n                      \n \n              \n             \n              \n \n \n   \n     \n          \n \n    \n      \n     \n     \n         \n        \n        \n        \n    \n    \n                 \n                 \n           \n     \n   \n              \n                     \n                  \n           \n          \n      \n   \nStrategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements \nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \ncontinued \nProvision for underpayment of employee entitlement \nIn 2021, a provision was established in respect of underpayments of employee entitlements affecting some current \nand former employees, following an extensive proactive pay compliance review carried out in Australia and New \nZealand. The Group anticipates that the remaining remediation payments will be made during 2023. \nProperty restoration provisions \nProperty restoration provisions relate to the estimate of costs to be incurred by the Group in its capacity as a \nlessee, when dismantling and removing the underlying asset, restoring the site on which it is located or restoring \nthe underlying asset to the condition required by the terms and conditions of the lease. Due to potential future \nrenewals of leases, the timing and potential cost are uncertain. \nNHS dental contract clawback provision \nA provision is held in respect of amounts that are expected to be deducted from future NHS contracts held \nby Bupa Dental Care UK, as a result of not meeting required treatment targets set by the NHS in the current \ncontract period. \nOther \nOther provisions include regulatory provisions relating to levies payable to the Group’s various regulators, \ncontract-related provisions, provisions for legal costs and other smaller provisions, along with contingent \nconsideration related to earn-out payable on acquisitions of dental practices in the UK and Poland. \nNote 21: \nTrade and ot\npayables \nher \nTrade and other payables in brief \nTrade and other payables arise in the ordinary course of business. \nNote \n2022 \n£m \n2021 \n£m \nAccruals 853 822 \nRefundable accommodation deposits (a) 455 449 \nTrade payables 268 242 \nOther payables 268 231 \nOccupational right agreement liabilities (b) 374 302 \nDeferred income and deferred revenue (c) 107 116 \nSocial security and other taxes 67 54 \nTotal trade and other payables 2,392 2,216 \nNon-current 71 66 \nCurrent 2,321 2,150 \nTrade and other payables (excluding deferred revenue) are carried at amortised cost.
